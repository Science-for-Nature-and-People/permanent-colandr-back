The reasoning of the Court will be evaluated as a means of exploring the relationship between law, policy and science. In particular, the extent to which science is able to define and confine the parameters of available policy options will be considered in light of the Animal Health Act 1981, section 21. Where legislation implicitly creates a requirement to produce affirmative scientific evidence as a condition precedent of administrative action, then science is indeed able to curtail political choice. However, it will be argued that the ability of science to operate in this manner is undermined, first, by the very nature of scientific discourse, where evidence is frequently contested and open to interpretation, and second, by the Court's traditional deference to administrative discretion in cases of a technical nature. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has been an unrelenting problem in UK cattle farming for a considerable time. The widespread utilisation of milk pasteurisation has effectively decimated any threat to human health but bTB continues to persist as an animal health problem. The UK and Welsh Governments' adherence to a 'test and slaughter' policy and the payment of compensation to owners of compulsorily-slaughtered infected cattle imposes a considerable burden on the taxpayer. 1 As such, successive governments have sought to implement measures and policies with the overall aim of bTB eradication. 2 It is a cruel irony that the suspected link between badgers and bTB and moves to provide badgers with statutory protection broadly coincided. 3 The Badgers Act 1973 represented a manifestation of a burgeoning consensus against the cruel and inhuman practice of badger baiting but the discovery of bTB-infected badgers created a new and considerably enhanced threat to one of the UK's most charismatic wild species. Thus, the efficacy of badger culling as a tool of bTB eradication is a highly controversial issue. Notwithstanding any ethical, economic or practical considerations, one might be tempted to think that the question of whether badger culling is able to reduce bTB is readily answerable by science. Experience teaches us that this is not the case; given the fundamentally 'soft' nature of biological science and epidemiology, contestability and contingency have become almost ubiquitous features of the debate. It is within this context that the Court of Appeal, in Badger Trust v Welsh Ministers, 4 was called upon to consider the legality of the Welsh Government's plans to authorise badger culling.

In the coming decades, people and animals will likely experience differ ent health issues than before, and some of these will be affected by climate variability and change. Because the role of climate in health outcomes is complex, and because interactions among human health, animal health, and the environment are complex, it is impossible to predict exactly the effects of climate change on health.

As the dynamics and interactions of these systems are highly complex and frequently unpredictable, there is a need to opt for transdisciplinary research addressing adaptive and integrated management of renewable resources. Companion modelling (ComMod) is a multi-agent systems (MAS)-based approach relying on synergistic effects between role-playing games (RPG) and agent-based models (ABM) to facilitate collective information sharing and learning, and to improve coordination among stakeholders for negotiation and decision-making. The iterative and adaptive sequences of fieldwork with modelling activities allows the mutual and interactive participation of stakeholders during the design, implementation, calibration and validation steps of the models, as well as exploration of possible scenarios. ComMod was implemented in a study of the conflict between two ethnic communities and a newly proposed national park in Northern Thailand. Deforestation, biodiversity conservation and the livelihoods of the villagers were key issues discussed during RPG sessions with small groups of participants, and subsequently represented in an ABM simulator used with a larger audience. Consequently, the local stakeholders learned about agro-ecological and socio-economic dynamics and gained an increased awareness of these key issues. Mutual understanding was improved, and the importance of collaborative discussion, essential to negotiations and decision-making, became obvious.

Among these are unpredictable and severe drought, desiccation or aridification due to persistent drought and dryland degradation or desertification. Because these problems overlap in their effects on the ground, often those who seek sustainable development for these drylands tend to view the problems as one and the same. Yet to facilitate the development of appropriate and effective mitigating measures it is important that the differences and interrelationships be clearly understood. This article starts by outlining the differences and interlinkages between desertification, drought, desiccation and climate change and their causal factors. The central theme is the human causes and consequences of desertification in the drylands of Africa. An attempt has been made to unravel the changing views on the human causes, this is followed by a brief outline of the intervening plans and actions to stem the problem. A significant drawback in combating desertification and drought is the failure of African governments to devolve power to the people who are affected, and to link environmental degradation to economic policy. Consequently, many programmes lack local support or are undermined by conflicting trade and agricultural policies pursued by governments. It is contended that, for sustainable development strategies to work, policies should put the welfare of the people in these drylands at the centre of the development agenda and give them the rights and the power to determine their future. They should empower the people to sustain adaptive strategies towards sustainable livelihoods. Also the threats posed to environment and sustainable development by protectionism and overconsumption in the north and structural adjustment programmes (SAPs), call for the removal of distortions created by the import barriers of developed country, the curbing of overconsumption and a fundamental revision in the structure of SAPs to help alleviate poverty and protect the environment in these African countries.

The majority of local inhabitants of the area are Gurungs, of Tibetan origin. The remoteness of the region has resulted in continued use of plants as medicine in an area where the ethnobotany has sparsely been documented. Methods: Interviews were conducted with amchi (Tibetan medicinal practitioners), local healers (including priests locally known as 'lamas'), plant traders, and knowledgeable villagers (including herders) regarding local plant names and their medicinal uses during several field visits (2002-2005). When convenient to the locals, a jungle or forest walk was done with the healers, allowing for both plant collection and detailed information gathering. Results: This present research documented 91 ethnomedicinal plant species, belonging to 40 families under 73 genera, and 45 new ethnomedicinal plant species are added. These 91 locally used medicinal plants are found to treat 93 ailments. This study provides information on 45 plant species previously unknown for their medicinal uses in Manang. The indication for use, mode of preparation, dose and administration of medicine are described in detail for each species. Conclusion: This wealth of ethnobotanical knowledge persists, and is being transferred to the next generation in some areas in upper Manang, in a country where this is often not the case. The senior amchi of the area (Karma Sonam Lama), who has been practicing Tibetan medicine for three generations, feels that it is of utmost importance to conserve the traditional healing system and to pass his knowledge on to the local community about the importance of medicinal plants. He hopes that this will lead to the conservation and sustainable management of medicinal plants in the villages. Over the duration of this research, the prices of several rare medicinal plants of Manang increased dramatically, highlighting both the scarcity and the quick disappearance of the species.

There has been, in recent years, a prolixity of differing views on the treatment of this question in which two opposing general tendencies stand out: the reductionist and the phenomenological positions. Reductionist theorists argue that a city is no more than a lattice of physical enclosures, apertures, planes, intersections bound together by the regulatory force of the Cartesian grid. A phenomenological approach, on the other hand, can provide a theory of wider scope; it can include in the description of a city's attributes the corporeal, the sensual and psychological aspects of subjective experience, as well as the broader cultural characteristics of the different communities and subcultures which contribute to the diversity of city spaces. From this point of view, the reductionist position appears locked within its own rigidity, creating ossified spaces by relying on the method of deductive analysis, rather than on direct sensory experience. Non-reductive theories (of which there are many different kinds) align themselves with the notion that a city is not just the sum total of buildings and streets; indeed, it is not generated by the neat ontological division of container and contained: metaphorical space can supervene upon the physical divisions of the urban metropolis. The phenomenological view adopts a body-centred paradigm in which there is no clear dichotomy between the experiencing subject and the external world. On this reading, time and space are perceived as fluid rather than immutably constituted. Space does not have an a priori character; it is defined and moulded by the subjectivity and social consciousness of those who experience and inhabit it. This has significant implications for understanding the role of sound as a component of urban experience. For the phenomenologist there is no veil of sense-data interposed between the epistemological subject and the objects of perception. Instead of space in the abstract, we may invoke the much more mercurial concept of place. Place allows particular localities to be defined in terms of their history and social use, investing them with cultural meanings and values and making them available for active intervention and transformation. Place can be used as a concept to define a geographical area on the scale of nation-states, or the intimate domain of the home. It can mean the reconfiguring of social boundaries. For a Jewish community, for example, the demarcation of the Eruv redefines an existing public space and creates a sanctuary as an extension of the sacred space of home or the synagogue. Ritual and custom are attributes that have the effect of strengthening attachment to places. A sense of place can also be generated through subeultural re-appropriation, such as the use of the concrete ramps and steps underneath London's South Bank centre by skateboarders. Place fuses the real with the mythical, the virtual with the actual; it is a space which encourages flights of imagination, as for instance in Robert J. Yudell's description of the Chrysler building 'Here we have not only the vertical differentiation of the building but chunky setbacks which conjure landscapes or grand stairways. We can imagine scaling, leaping and occupying its surface and interstices' (Bloomer and Moore, 1977). The essential point, I think, of this phenomenological approach, is to show that it is not the space itself that changes; rather it implies a transformation in attitude to space and how we define it. Our climate, culturally speaking, is increasingly defined in terms of visual space. Media and communication for the most part are equated with billboards, television and recently DVD. Aural space has, for the moment, become merely a ubiquitous presence, to be registered peripherally. However, I will argue that sound, especially within the context of the urban environment, is never a neutral phenomenon. Each sound is imbued with its own lexical code: sound as sign, symbol, index; as ostensibly defining a personal territory in the case of the ghettoblaster or car stereo; as creating a portable soundscape in the case of the Walkman. Phenomenology has the potential to play a critical role in contributing towards an aural definition of space, but its impact has yet to be fully realized. There has been, however, a group of practitioners who have sought to articulate a humanist account of the sonic environment. Essentially, soundscape design alms to increase people's awareness of their own sonic environment in order that they might play an active role in its subsequent transformation: eliminating noise which desensitizes the ear, while preserving sounds whose semantic signals play a defining role for a community or churches respect the need for quiet contemplation. Churches and cathedral spaces are particularly interesting in cities because they are among the few spaces which stretch time. Long reverberation times affect actions within the space, slowing movement and speech; small incidental sounds are magnified, allowing the listener to appreciate internal harmonic fluctuations as the tone decays. The acoustic ability to stretch sound has several different effects: speech which allows time for the words to hang in the air before evaporating out of audible range can appear more weighty and monumental, even rhetorical. Within these spaces incidental sound material, sounds which we may treat as aural dust, footfalls or the occasional cough, are also given heightened presence through filtering and natural amplification. Lengthening a sound's life has invested it with a reverential sanctity that is usually reserved for ecclesiastical objects. The church as acoustic vessel tends to give the worshipper a multi-sensory experience of the sacred. Music theorist Kurt Blaukopf has suggested that sound could be seen as a mediator between congregation and sacred ritual. Low-frequency non-directional sound helps to bind a community together: This directness of sounds that cannot be located contributes significantly to the social effect of the musical-liturgical event. The anonymity of the sound source built into the architecture is the acoustic guarantee for the internalizing of church norms and, at the same time, the basis for the view that comprehends church liturgy as part of the heavenly liturgy. (Blaukopf, 1982: 182) So, what is an urban soundscape? I have described various aspects of what constitutes an urban sonic fabric. Schafer's approach has merit insofar as it has defined terms which enable a listener to decipher the aural landscape. However, embedded in his work is a romantic bias towards antiquarian or rural soundscapes, as if these are assumed to be more refined than their modern-day equivalents. While Schafer's energy is spent defending the case for cleaning up urban pollutants, other issues, such as whether sound can aid our understanding of social relationships between communities, get left aside. These aspects are examined in the work of both Corbin and Stoekfeld, and surprisingly these reveal similar tendencies in asserting the significance of acoustic territory. Important for me is the notion that aural space is both tactile and ephemeral: it cannot be contained within fixed boundaries. Sound objects can be electronically magnified, replicated and scattered like dust over an entire cityscape. Aural space should be celebrated as the most liquid of spaces, offering a model for the kind of fluidity that a whole range of other disciplines aspire to.", "publication_year": null, "doi": "10.1177/0263276404040486"}, {"title": "Creating the conditions for growth: a collaborative practice development programme for clinical nurse leaders", "citation_id": 3497, "authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Boomer, C A", "McCormack, B"]}, "abstract": "Aim To evaluate a 3-year practice development (PD) programme for clinical nurse leaders.

The study of forest ecosystem health also provides a significant practical service by suggesting ways to increase the level of sustainability in forest management although the definition of forest health remains controversial. The concept of health is well understood as applied to humans but the human concept of health may not be appropriate for ecosystems. The difficulties of defining the optimal conditions for ecosystem health have led to a lack of universally accepted indicators used to measure ecosystem health. Several forest ecosystem health assessment systems have already been developed. For example, ecosystem health can be assessed using measures of resilience, vigor and organization and most of today's assessment systems are based on these concepts. In this research, the forest ecosystem health of 60 sample plots in Wangqing Forest was investigated. A new assessment model of forest ecosystem health based on the disturbance, H = \u2211B2 W2 - \u2211B1 W1, is proposed and used in this study, where H represents a measure of ecosystem health and B1, B2, W1 and W2 represent harmful sources of disturbance, forest ecosystem stability, the weights of B1 and B2, respectively. Based on qualitative analysis of existing data, eight indices which were divided into two categories were selected as assessment indices of forest ecosystem health in Wangqing Forest. Several harmful sources of disturbance were considered including forest diseases, forest pest species, wildfires and human-caused disturbances. Measurements of forest ecosystem stability include measurements of biological diversity, forest community structure and measurements documenting how closely a forest study plot resembles expected natural forest conditions. These types of data have frequently been used to measure ecosystem complexity and health. Additionally, two types of analysis, the Analytic Hierarchy Process and coefficient of variation analysis, were used in combination with weighted evaluation indictors to objectively evaluate the forest health of the study plots. We propose a new forest ecosystem healthy assessment model and classification system. The 60 sample plots of Wangqing Forest were divided into four health risk categories: very healthy, healthy, fairly healthy and unhealthy. By calculating a composite value for forest health, the status of forest ecosystem health of individual Wangqing Forest plots was determined. As the results showed, 6, 13, 23 and 18 (or 10%, 21.67%, 38.33%, and 30% of all plots) plots were categorized as very healthy, healthy, fairly healthy, and unhealthy, respectively; the health indices for these four groups of plots were measured as 0.5 \u22650.2, 0.2 \u22650.1, 0 \u22650.1, -0.5< 0, respectively. Most of the forest plots with conditions resembling natural forest conditions, high levels of biodiversity and a strong ability to adjust to environmental change, such as pure natural forest, natural mixed needleleaf/ broadleaf forest and mixed broadleaf forest, were categorized as healthy or fairly-healthy, while nearly all plantation forests plots which did not have conditions resembling natural forest conditions, but had low levels of biodiversity and a weak ability to adjust to environmental change were classified as unhealthy.

The concept of health is well understood as applied to humans but the human concept of health may not be appropriate for ecosystems. The difficulties of defining the optimal conditions for ecosystem health have led to a lack of universally accepted indicators to measure ecosystem health. In this paper, a healthy forest ecosystem is defined as a system having good mechanisms for self-regulation, such as beneficial mechanisms that allow an ecosystem to react to external harmful disturbances. Positive ecosystem responses to negative changes keep forest ecosystems intact, stable and sustainable. With this concept of forest ecosystem health in mind, we can discuss assessment methods which can be used to monitor forest ecosystem health. Several forest ecosystem health assessment systems already exist. For example, ecosystem health can be assessed using measures of resilience, vigor and organization. Today, most assessment systems are based on this concept. Based on the concept of forest ecosystem health presented above, a new approach is proposed, which considers four external harmful disturbances: forest fire, forest pest species, air pollution and human-caused disturbances. This method is designed to build assessment indicator systems which can be used to monitor and evaluate forest ecosystem health. It also considers beneficial disturbances in this assessment indicator system. This method includes an analysis of forest fire disturbance, which causes severe damage to forest ecosystems, followed by eight other indicators of forest health including average precipitation, average temperature, proportion of flammable species, crown density, altitude, slope gradient, slope direction and distance between the forest and the nearest road. Disturbance caused by forest pests can also be measured. These include disturbances caused by forest animals, such as rat and rabbit damage, as well as indicators like forest diseases and forest pests, the degree of damage and rate of infection in host trees. Air pollution disturbance can be measure by studying leaf damage as well as soil and contamination analysis. The study of harmful human-caused disturbances includes measurement of forest management techniques such as timber harvest and management of undergrowth vegetation. Measurements of forest ecosystem stability include measurements of biological diversity, forest community structure and measurements documenting how closely a forest is to natural conditions, with natural conditions defined as being free of human-caused disturbances. These types of measurements have been used frequently to measure ecosystem complexity and health. Next, the content and significance of key indicators were also well-analyzed. This forest ecosystem health assessment indicator system abandons traditional assessment ideas and combines the most important factors which have been determined to be closely related to forest ecosystem health in recent years. This assessment indicator system focuses at the ecosystem level and has mostly been applied to forests both in South and North China. Information is presented for use by forest and district resource managers as well as academic experts. This assessment indicator system establishes a scientific basis for conducting forest health projects, provides a context for planning ecosystem restoration, and contributes to the understanding of the physical, biological, and human dimensions of these ecosystems. This research may enrich the theories and methods used in assessing the health of ecological systems.", "publication_year": null, "doi": null}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"title": "Assessmement of ozone impact on human health in Italy, through the integrated assessment modelling system minni", "citation_id": 20364, "authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["D'Elia, I", "Monforti, F", "Pignatelli, T", "Vialetto, G", "Zanini, G"]}, "abstract": "In Europe, increasing attention has been given to the effect of ground level ozone on human health.

An Israeli warplane destroys the home of a militant Palestinian. A retaliatory suicide bomber blows up an Israeli bus. In both instances, innocent people die and the anger escalates. Missing from the media coverage is any clear sense of what is going on in the day-to-day relationship between the two countries other than the sporadic violent exchanges. Between the missiles and bombs, people are-under great duress, and at great risk-continuing to trade services and goods, drive crossborder trucks, commute through checkpoints to their jobs or schools-and manage a range of transboundary natural resources that are essential to the livelihoods of all the peoples in the region. There's a theory gaining adherents among some of the more thoughtful observers of this troubled land, that it is in those essential day-to-day activities that the real chance for achieving peace can be found. In the common resources essential to all life, and especially in fresh water, the conflicting cultures share a universal interest. Water is extremely scarce in this region and getting scarcer. Human desperation is never greater than when water is no longer in reach. If the people of this region can find viable ways of cooperating in the management of this most valuable of all resources, there's no other challenge they can't meet. A leading proponent of this theory is the grassroots group Friends of the Earth Middle East (FoEME), an international NGO that has recently brought new attention to one of history's most storied bodies of water-the Dead Sea. In short, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan all need to coordinate their management of humanity's most valuable natural resource in ways that address not only their own national needs but the competing needs of farmers and city-dwellers, tourism and mining, and the visitors to Muslim, Jewish, and Christian holy sites. Given the stalling of the Bush-Sharon \"Road Map\" for Israeli-Palestinian peace, that might seem like day-dreaming. But in fact, some of the envisioned Dead Sea cooperation is already happening, in ways that aren't being seen in other areas of conflict. Some of this laying of at least the groundwork for a cooperative stabilization has to do with the immediacy of water-the fact that neither humans nor birds can live for more than a few days without it, and cannot wait through years of political posturing. In this sense, water is just the leading edge of the Earth's resources overall, and the dry Middle East is just one of the first regions being forced to decide between a higher level of cooperation than in the past, and ever-larger repeats of the civilizational catastrophes of the past.", "publication_year": null, "doi": null}, {"title": "Experiences and lessons learned in the framework of a global un effort in support of neglected and underutilized species", "citation_id": 19580, "authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Bala Ravi, S", "Bhag, Maf", "Gotor, E", "Jager, M", "Padulosi, S", "Polar, V", "Rojas, W", "Valdivia, R"]}, "abstract": "From 2001 to 2010, an international effort was made through the implementation of two global projects aimed at enhancing the sustainable conservation and use of neglected and underutilized species (NUS). These projects represented the first UN-supported endeavors on NUS and tested out a novel collaborative framework involving all actors along the value chain of some representative target species (incl. Andean grains and minor millets). Stakeholders involved in the implementation of these projects ranged from scientists engaged in surveying, collecting, conserving and studying the genetic diversity of target species to farmers contributing to their maintenance in situ/on-farm, from breeders and experts working to develop better cultivars and value addition technologies to user groups, including women's associations. Nutritionists, school teachers and media experts were also active partners in implementing public awareness activities. Impact assessment studies have shown that these efforts have been highly successful, though challenging, with regard to maintaining effective and cohesive collaboration across so many different actors and groups with diverse interests. The key lesson learned from these efforts is that the NUS promotion requires, first and foremost, the adoption of a new R&D paradigm, directed towards cultural-sensitive objectives and not solely towards economic benefits. The promotion of NUS in any country, regardless of its state of development, is an opportunity to promote and make use of the crop diversity and associated food traditions present at the local level, which are the unique expression of the work of generations of farmers and users. Safeguarding such a heritage is an important contribution to protecting the identity of local communities and reinforcing their self-esteem and confidence to counteract threats of standardization of local food culture arising from globalization trends and changes in life styles. Essential in pursuing the use-enhancement of NUS is the adoption of multi-stakeholder, multi-disciplinary and participatory approaches. Because of the central role of women in deploying NUS diversity in everyday life, interventions to enhance their capacities in farming, adding value, marketing and cooking these species are critical. Furthermore, whereas better cultivars and technologies can help in making NUS economically more competitive, these projects have, however, shown that any increase in demands for such species and products can only be achieved once the food-of-the-poor stigma, that so often accompanies them, is effectively removed. Policies to develop standards in processing or promoting the inclusion of nutritious NUS in school feeding programs are also highly relevant. The role of multi-stakeholder platforms for promoting NUS is another important aspect emerging from these international efforts. A robust and gender-sensitive, capacity-building program for disseminating best practices and develop skills among users groups is essential for effective projects' exit strategies. The unabated genetic erosion of NUS, so poorly represented in ex situ germplasm collections, is also affecting the resilience and adaptation of traditional agro-ecosystems to climate change. Greater R&D attention on in situ conservation of NUS at the farm level is advocated through strategic interventions such as those supporting community-based participatory monitoring, custodian farmers' networks and crop diversity fairs.", "publication_year": null, "doi": null}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"title": "Development, testing and intercalibration of reference methods for pollution studies in coastal and estuarine waters", "citation_id": 1497, "authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Aston, S R"]}, "abstract": "Following the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) initiated a Regional Seas Programme in 1974. At present the Programme involves ten regions and has over 120 coastal states participating. It is conceived as an action-orientated programme having concern not only for the consequences but also for the causes of environmental degradation and encompassing a comprehensive approach to combating environmental problems through the management of marine and coastal areas. Each regional action plan is formulated according to the needs of the region as perceived by the governments concerned. The overall strategy of the programmes was defined by UNEP's Governing Council as: 1. Promotion of international and regional conventions, guidelines and actions for the control of marine pollution and for the protection of management of aquatic resources. 2. Assessment of the state of marine pollution, of the sources and trends of this pollution, and of impact of the pollution on human health, marine ecosystems, and amenities. 3. Co-ordination of the efforts with regard to the environmental aspects of the protection, development and management of marine and coastal resources. 4. Support for education and training efforts to make possible the full participation of developing countries in the protection, development and management of marine and coastal resources. One the basic components of the regional action plans is the assessment of the state of marine pollution. For this purpose a set of Reference Methods for marine pollution studies is being developed. The paper describes the development of Reference Methods for use by participants in Regional Seas Programmes, where they are intended to ensure that the data can be compared on the world-wide basis and thus contribute to the Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) of UNEP. Also, the basis for the Reference Methods as a basis by which countries can adopt comparable methods of assessing the extent of marine pollution in the event of inter-governmental disputes is explained. The Reference Methods being developed cover a wide range of pollutants, e.g. trace metals, chlorinated hydrocarbons, petroleum hydrocarbons, tar, bacteria, etc., as well as providing guidelines for sampling strategies, preparation of samples, toxicity tests, data handling and evaluation. In addition, they include information on how basic oceanographic parameters are to be assessed and used to supplement the data on marine pollution. The paper draws on particular aspects of the development and testing of some individual Reference Methods to illustrate the problems and philosophy adopted for a project which represents a world-wide attempt to promote the detection, understanding and control of coastal and estuarine pollution.

Natural hazards studies are also essential for a better understanding of ecosystem protection and the relationship between the environment and human health. The protection of people from natural risks in high mountains areas requires an understanding of the nature of hazards phenomena. Therefore, research into basic geomorphological hazards in high mountains could be understood not only as a set of case studies but, first of all, as a rare opportunity for the preparation of theoretical models and for the understanding of the general architecture of the origin of natural disasters. At present, a lot of international research projects are focused on determining the extent to which the geodynamic processes affecting the Earth's surface constrain land use and engineering works. It is also important to estimate the range of the effects of anthropogenous activities on the rate of natural geodynamic processes.

The consequences of global change for population health are examined, including the emergence of drug-resistant diseases, and the implications of climate warming and pollution for health. Addressing these issues presents a considerable challenge for nursing at all levels, in promoting sustainable policies, integrating environmental considerations into clinical practice, and in the nursing role as health educators. The greatest challenge is to education, to raise awareness of the relevance and importance of the global environment to health, and to empower nurses with sufficient understanding of the issues to apply them to practice, participate in debate and contribute to policy-making that aims to reduce the burden of global changes.

In 2000, over half of all Guatemalans lived in poverty. About 16% lived in extreme poverty. Available evidence suggests that poverty in Guatemala is higher than in other Central American countries. Although poverty has fallen over the past decade, its trend recently declined due to a series of economic shocks during 2001 and 2002. The drop of poverty incidence since 1990 is slightly slower than what would have been predicted given Guatemala's growth rates, suggesting that growth has not been particularly \"pro-poor.\" This pattern arises largely because growth in the rural sectors-where the poor are largely concentrated-has been slower than in other areas. Poverty and vulnerability are mainly chronic whereas only a fifth were transient poor. Likewise, while 64% of the population could be considered vulnerable to poverty, the majority of these are vulnerable due to low overall expected consumption rather than high volatility of consumption. The chronic nature of poverty and vulnerability highlights the importance of building the assets of the poor, rather than focusing primarily on the expansion of public safety nets or social insurance. Nonetheless, some public transfers (social assistance) could indeed be desirable to alleviate the poverty and suffering of the extreme poor, particularly when linked to participation in health and education activities. The Peace Accords represented a turning point for Guatemala's development path, paving the way for a transformation to a more prosperous and inclusive nation. Key areas related to economic development and poverty reduction include: a focus on human development, productive and sustainable development, modernization of the democratic state, and strengthening and promoting participation. The rights of the indigenous and women were also highlighted as cross-cutting themes throughout the accords, in an attempt to reverse the historical exclusion of these groups. Given the importance of improving living conditions to lasting peace, poverty reduction has taken center stage on the current social policy agenda. In particular, the Government outlined its poverty reduction strategy in a policy document \"Estrategia de Reducci\u00f3n de la Pobreza\" (ERP). General principles emphasized in the ERP include: a rural focus, using the poverty map for targeting; efficient and transparent public spending; decentralization; and participation. Key action areas include: (a) promoting growth with equity; (b) investing in human capital (emphasizing health, education and food security); and (c) investing in physical capital (particularly water and sanitation, rural roads, electricity, and rural development). Cross-cutting issues in the ERP include multiculturalism and inter-culturality, gender equity, and vulnerability. The preparation of the ERP helped to introduce some policies, such as improved targeting by using the poverty map, but the dialogue on the poverty reduction agenda and on many of ERP's recommendations should be reactivated and possibly included in the agenda for the new administration. In the six years since the signing of the Peace Accords, Guatemala has taken important steps on this new development path, with progress in public sector management, public revenues and spending, and improvements in the coverage and equity of education and basic services. Importantly, these steps signal that progress is possible, despite the magnitude of the challenge of changing the course of history. Despite progress, households have not perceived significant improvements in living conditions and households are decidedly more pessimistic about changes in their welfare since the Peace Accords. They attribute their perceptions to economic factors, such as a lack of increases in incomes and opportunities (factors that directly affect \"their wallets.\") Many of the challenges for poverty reduction coincide largely with the remaining actions on the Peace Agenda. In particular, select development-related targets supported by the Peace Accords have not been met, especial y those involving outcomes in health, education and economic growth as well as fundamental institutional reforms. The lack of progress in these key development outcomes reflects the need for renewed efforts to achieve poverty reduction and improvements in living conditions, which are crucial for lasting peace. The overlaps between the Peace Agenda and the poverty reduction agenda highlight remaining priority challenges in several key areas: (a) creating opportunities; (b) reducing vulnerability; and (c) improving institutions and empowering communities. In developing a broad agenda for poverty reduction, three caveats are important to emphasize at the outset: First, while there is no single \"blueprint\" for poverty reduction, there are some key levers that take central stage for national efforts to reduce poverty. Second, the policy discussion is aimed primarily at the perspective of policy makers and the role of the public sector; hence it emphasizes interventions that both (a) would have a substantial impact on poverty; and (b) merit the use of public resources in a market-oriented economy. Third, poverty reduction is a multidimensional and long-term process. There is no single magic bullet to reduce poverty. Rather, efforts should be made to attack the poverty problem from a multitude of angles, including those to foster opportunity, build assets, reduce vulnerability, and improve institutions and empower communities. The overall purpose of this report is to offer the Government of Guatemala a comprehensive assessment of poverty and of policies that affect the prospects for poverty reduction in the country and to suggest some general guidelines which it is hoped will be helpful for the Government to further develop its strategy to reduce poverty. At the same time, the report is intended to inform civil society in Guatemala and other external donors, and to trigger a dialogue on the path to follow to overcome vulnerability and poverty.", "publication_year": null, "doi": null}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"title": "Pharmaceutical ethnobotany in the western part of Granada province (southern Spain): Ethnopharmacological synthesis", "citation_id": 2671, "authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Benitez, G", "Gonzalez-Tejero, M R", "Molero-Mesa, J"]}, "abstract": "Aim: The aim of this work is to catalogue, document, and make known the uses of plants for folk medicine in the western part of the province of Granada (southern Spain).

The second system, 'Colombo's system', was composed by farmers which sell their products to supermarkets (long chain). Certification is done by external auditing and farmers receive medium to high support derived from governmental policies. The final phase comprehended participative observations skills and was carried out with semi-structured interviews and focal groups. Research results indicate that the services supported by public resources show limited results and policies are disarticulated. Thus, current policies do not effectively support organic farmers and farmers transitioning to organic agriculture. In marketing terms, consumers find it difficult to access organic food, mainly due to market placement, price and awareness. The farmers establish prices through nontechnical criteria which increase consumer's difficulties.
