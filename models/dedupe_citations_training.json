Plants typically favor the nitrogen form most abundant in their natural habitats. Nitrate has been recognized as the dominant mineral nitrogen form in most agricultural soils and the main nitrogen source for crops, but it is not usually the case in forest ecosystems.

Low levels of NO3 - in these forest soils generally correspond to low net rates of nitrification. The probable reasons for this phenomenon include: (1) nitrification limitations and/or inhibitions caused by lower pH, lower NH 4 + availability (autotrophic nitrifiers can't successfully compete for NH4 + with heterotrophic organisms and plants), or allelopathic inhibitors (tannins or higher-molecular-weight proanthocyanidins) in the soil; or (2) substantial microbial acquisition of nitrate in the soils which makes net nitrification rates substantially less than gross nitrification rates even though the latter are relatively high. Many coniferous species (especially such late successional tree species as Tsuga heterophylla, Pinus banksiana, Picea glauca, Pseudotsuga meziesii, Picea abies and etc.) fully adapt to their original NH4 +-dominated \"nutrition habitats\" so that their capacities of absorbing and using non-reduced forms of nitrogen (e. g. NO3 -) substantially decrease. These conifers typically show distinct preference to NH 4 + and reduced growth due to nitrogen-metabolism disorder when NO3 - is the main nitrogen source. The physiological and biochemical mechanisms that account for the adaptation to NH 4 +-dominated systems (or limited ability to use NO 3 -) for the coniferous species include : (i) distribution and activity of enzymes for catalyzing nitrogen reduction and assimilation, generally characterized by lower nitrate reductase (NR); (ii) greater tolerance to NHt or rapid detoxification of ammonium nitrogen in the roots; (iii) lower capacity of absorption to NO3 - by roots that might be controlled by feedback regulations of certain N-transport compounds, such as glutamine; (iv) relations and balance between nitrogen and other elements (such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ etc.).

While violence has and will continue around water, water is far more humanity's learning ground for building community than it is a cause of war. Increased interdependence through water sharing plans and infrastructure networks can be seen as increases of our flexibility and capacity to respond to exigencies of nature and reduce our vulnerability to events such as droughts and floods and thereby increase security. The history of social organization around river basins and watersheds is humanity's richest records of our dialogue with nature. It is among the most fertile areas for learning about how the political and technical interact. The spatial and functional characteristics of the river basins influenced human settlement and interaction long before the idea of the river basin started to be formalized into legal and administrative terms.

While violence has and will continue around water, water is far more humanity's learning ground for building community than it is a cause of war.

The history of social organization around river basins and watersheds is humanity's richest records of our dialogue with nature. It is among the most fertile areas for learning about how the political and technical interact.

A very high proportion of them will be infants and young children. Even as you read on, many millions of others will be suffering from such acute under-nutrition and/or malnutrition that they will soon fall victim to one fatal infectious disease or another. And even as I type the following words into the computer in front of me, an unforgivably large percentage of the total human population on earth is suffering the unbearable pain and disabling effects of acute hunger. From a technical perspective, this is a very difficult situation to explain, and certainly, to justify. In this era of hi-tech scientific agriculture, of the transnational flow of goods and services and 'global free trade', and of the world wide web of available information, such circumstances seem both inexcusable and, technically at least, essentially preventable. From such a perspective, poverty and hunger are functions of scientific ignorance. Once people come to understand the nature of science, and learn about its application in modern agricultural technologies, then, so the argument goes, more food could be grown, economic production could flourish, poverty can be alleviated and hunger could be a thing of the past. This could even be true in those parts of the world where conditions of soil, climate and water, etc., are less than optimal for food production, where conditions, either temporarily or permanently do not allow particular people access to secure and sustainable sources of food in their own locale, then the issue simply becomes one of distribution from locations elsewhere, where food could be grown in surplus amounts. Either way the solution, from this perspective, comes down to better education in the sciences and technologies of food production and distribution. At base, the issue of what we might call the agri-food system, is thus merely a matter of matching the physical needs for food on the one hand with the means to both produce and distribute it on the other. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that, for the foreseeable future at least, there is more than sufficient production and distribution capacities on the planet to supply food to every one of its six billion inhabitants on a sustainable basis. With so many hundreds of millions of human beings suffering from food deprivation across the world, however-and with so many nations apparently unable to assure their citizens a secure and sustainable source of food-the situation is clearly much more complex than the technical picture alone would indicate: For if it were otherwise, the problem would not exist at all. Even the addition of an economic perspective to the technical one is sufficient to add weight to the argument that technical ways of doing things are not up to the task of either explaining the situation or providing more effective strategies for change: Matching effective demand with price-sensitive supply through 'the market mechanism' is not at all the same thing as matching actual needs with the physical product to meet those needs! But even the integration of the economic with the technical is still insufficient to explain the true complexity of the situation, or its failure-or most especially, to provide indicators to 'the way forward from here': For once again there would be no problem if market forces, in conjunction with technical expertise, were truly effective in assuring equitable and sustainable distribution of food universally across the globe. The situation is clearly much more complex than even these two perspectives combined allow, and the suspicion is that we are failing to deal with it because of the way the process of development has conventionally been conceptualised and pursued. Indeed, as Habermas among others has emphasised, the undue reliance on technical and economic perspectives in these modern times, has singularly distorted our ways of 'doing things in the world'. What is needed, he has long argued, is equal attention to a third dimension of the process of taking effective action in the world-a third perspective that focuses on 'emancipation' and the equitable interaction between human beings in their pursuit of consensual actions for the common good (Habermas, 1984). Roling and Woodhill (2001), in reinforcing the usefulness of the three distinctions between different ways of viewing the world, argue that the interactive perspective is especially essential because it brings people into negotiation with each other in circumstances that call for explicit attention to differing values, goals and interests as fundamental to the development of collective interests and common strategies for action. If the modernization process itself is becoming problematic because of its paradigmatic limitations, as writers such as Ulrich Beck and others are strongly suggesting with their theories of 'reflexive modernisation' and the 'risk society' (Beck, Giddens and Lash, 1994), then our entire way of approaching the further development of complex matters such sustainable agri-food systems will be necessary at all levels of social organisation, from the global to local. This in turn will place a penetrating focus on our current institutions of governance and service and indeed our prevailing social norms and mores, which are all appearing less and less adequate to the task of supporting sustainable development in any sphere of human activity (Beck, 1992). As one writer has recently put it in the context of natural resource management: 'Our institutions and mechanisms of governance seem increasingly archaic; a global economic system that does not value natural capital; technical single discipline and inflexible government agencies; inappropriate property rights; and social norms that value immediate individual material wealth over ecological integrity and social equity' (Woodhill, 2002, p. 2). Woodhill is among those who, for instance, see 'social learning' as an alternative to the two classical strategies for governance: (a) the assumption of exclusive responsibility for making decisions on behalf of its citizens and (b) the belief that social change is best left to 'market forces' with minimal interventions by governments. The contrast is for us as humans to accept our responsibilities for learning our own ways forward collectively, and this in turn implies the need to escape our old ways of thinking and doing things, and to collectively embrace the new. It will become necessary for us to not only learn our way forward but also to learn how to learn our way forward: And the emphasis on 'we' and 'us' here rather than on 'them', is of profound significance, as of course is the emphasis on learning, and especially on collective or social learning. All of this is of considerable importance to the institutions of education-in all senses of the phrase (from formal schooling organisations, through policy and governance institutions, to curricula and accepted pedagogical practices). The new goal must be inclusivity-the democratic pursuit of participative development strategies that focus on sustainable and equitable improvements in 'well-being' that are inclusive of everyone (and indeed of the rest of 'nature' too). For development to be truly inclusive, the techno-economic mindset of traditional development must be expanded to also include perspectives that can be labelled ethical and ecological-where the latter is interpreted as the full range of relationships between people and nature from scientific to spiritual. A wide spectrum of human values lie at the heart of this matter-and the trouble with reliance on only the technical and the economic perspectives of development with respect to agri-food systems, is that this key point is lost. The value that is placed on the life and well-being of every individual on earth is cited as one of the key hallmarks of contemporary 'modern' civilization. This necessarily must translate into a set of rights that all human beings should be accorded by the nation state of which they are citizens. The 'flip side' of this of course, is a set of ethical responsibilities that every civilized nation-state must ensure that the rights of its citizens are respected, protected and most essentially, enabled. To live ethically-to make decisions that are ethically defensible-is to act on what it is that we feel we ought to do, only after taking the interests and preferences of others, fully into account (Singer, 1995). And such accounts need to particularly focus on the future as a key perspective, in order to include the needs and interests and preferences of those yet born, as well as to indicate potential future consequences of intended present actions. The foundations for our ethics lie in the values that we hold, and how these influence what it is that we both think and feel about what it is that we should do to reach a future that is both sustainable and defensible. Tradition has held that two different sets of value assumptions are involved in ethical perspectives. The first of these (neo-Kantian) embrace a seemingly innate sense of right and wrong that asserts the primary significance of duties and rights. The second set (consequential) emphasises rights and wrongs in terms of the goodness or badness of the consequences of their outcomes. Among the most basic of these rights and responsibilities to the well-being of all of the world's citizenry, is to assure its secure and sustainable access to food. Reflections on much of our so-called technical progress, reveals that it has often been achieved in violation of either or both of these value positions. We, and our institutions alike, have proceeded with little care or due attention to our 'duties' and responsibilities to others-be they other humans or other species in nature. We have also introduced technologies that have had indisputably destructive impacts on both bio-physical and socio-cultural environments in which we are embedded. To borrow a phrase from the philosopher Prozesky (1998) our focus should now turn to development for 'inclusive well-being'. Prozesky's focus has been on ethics in the context of the challenge of 'national transformation' of post-apartheid South Africa. His call has been for 'nothing less than an ethical renaissance' with 'a new surge of moral power is now needed' to ensure a 'general renaissance' of that nation. With respect to the matters of concern in this present chapter, the good news is that a 'general renaissance' is indeed in the air. There is mounting evidence, from a whole variety of sources both within and beyond the global agri-food system, of such a surge in 'moral power' that the whole paradigm underlying the conventional approaches to the alleviation of starvation etc. is undergoing a vital, if still gradual, transformation. A fresh worldview that does embrace the need to pursue forms of development that are focused on improvements in 'inclusive well-being' is clearly emerging in various educational institutions, and research organisations across the world, and even on some national and international policy and governance landscapes. And while it justifiably attracts a great deal of 'bad press' and negative feelings among many in its present form, a process of responsible globalisation can provide both a momentum for, and processes appropriate to, further paradigmatic transformations 'for the greater good of all'-people and nature. Perhaps the first step is the acceptance of the complexity of issues like sustainable universal food security, and indeed of ways of knowing and acting that not only accommodate such complexity, but also appreciate their own complexity.

Monitoring water quality of the Nile system (Lake Naser, the main Nile and its branches, irrigation canals, drains and groundwater aquifers) started as early as the 1980s. The complexity of water quality management required the development of other mechanisms including policies, institutional and governance arrangements, infrastructure for monitoring and analytic laboratories, awareness and skilled human resources. This paper describes the different aspects of water quality management in Egypt and the current state as it stands by the end of the first decade of the 21st century. It also presents the methodology used in turning several monitoring programmes managed by different institutions into one national integrated system. It argues that water quality management is multifaceted and while progress along one aspect could be significant, other aspects could be lacking due to multiple reasons, the high cost involved in pollution reduction at the source is not the least."}, {"authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Anton, A", "Canals, L M I", "Chapagain, A", "Chenoweth, J", "Clift, R", "Orr, S"]}, "title": "Assessing freshwater use impacts in LCA: Part I-inventory modelling and characterisation factors for the main impact pathways", "publication_year": 2009, "citation_id": 4822, "doi": "10.1007/s11367-008-0030-z", "abstract": "Freshwater is a basic resource for humans; however, its link to human health is seldom related to lack of physical access to sufficient freshwater, but rather to poor distribution and access to safe water supplies. On the other hand, freshwater availability for aquatic ecosystems is often reduced due to competition with human uses, potentially leading to impacts on ecosystem quality. This paper summarises how this specific resource use can be dealt with in life cycle analysis (LCA). The main quantifiable impact pathways linking freshwater use to the available supply are identified, leading to definition of the flows requiring quantification in the life cycle inventory (LCI). The LCI needs to distinguish between and quantify evaporative and non-evaporative uses of 'blue' and 'green' water, along with land use changes leading to changes in the availability of freshwater. Suitable indicators are suggested for the two main impact pathways [namely freshwater ecosystem impact (FEI) and freshwater depletion (FD)], and operational characterisation factors are provided for a range of countries and situations. For FEI, indicators relating current freshwater use to the available freshwater resources (with and without specific consideration of water ecosystem requirements) are suggested. For FD, the parameters required for evaluation of the commonly used abiotic depletion potentials are explored. An important value judgement when dealing with water use impacts is the omission or consideration of non-evaporative uses of water as impacting ecosystems. We suggest considering only evaporative uses as a default procedure, although more precautionary approaches (e.g. an 'Egalitarian' approach) may also include non-evaporative uses. Variation in seasonal river flows is not captured in the approach suggested for FEI, even though abstractions during droughts may have dramatic consequences for ecosystems; this has been considered beyond the scope of LCA. The approach suggested here improves the representation of impacts associated with freshwater use in LCA. The information required by the approach is generally available to LCA practitioners The widespread use of the approach suggested here will require some development (and consensus) by LCI database developers. Linking the suggested midpoint indicators for FEI to a damage approach will require further analysis of the relationship between FEI indicators and ecosystem health."}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Leitmann, J"]}, "title": "Katowice", "publication_year": 1994, "citation_id": 14991, "doi": null, "abstract": "Katowice is at the heart of the Upper Silesian Industrial Region which is the primary source of key raw materials for the Polish economy and the centre of heavy industry.

The chemical relationships in Piper's diagram, Chebotarev's genetic classification and Gibbs's diagram suggest that the groundwaters mainly belong to non-carbonate alkali type and Cl- group, and are controlled by evaporation-dominance, respectively, due to the influence of semi-arid climate, gentle slope, sluggish drainage conditions, greater water-rock interaction, and anthropogenic activities. A comparison of the groundwater quality in relation to drinking water quality standards proves that most of the water samples are not suitable for drinking, especially in post-monsoon period. US Salinity Laboratory's and Wilcox's diagrams, and %Na+ used for evaluating the water quality for irrigation suggest that the majority of the groundwater samples are not good for irrigation in post-monsoon compared to that in pre-monsoon.

The first principal component is characterized by total dissolved solids, Na+, Cl-, HCO3 -, NO3 -, pH and F- parameters, and the second principal component is represented by Ca2+, SO4 2-, Mg2+ and NO3 - ions. These components are interpreted as controlled by the higher rate of evapotranspiration, topographic lows, poor drainage conditions, longer residence of water in the aquifer, ion exchange, irrigation return flow, heavy use of fertilizers, and sewage wastes, which are further supported by the scatter diagrams, ionic signatures, and mechanisms controlling the water chemistry diagrams. The principal component scores clearly explained the variations in the local and regional hydrogeochemical processes, broadly distinguished the geogenic sources from the anthropogenic ones, and easily helped to select the index wells for the long-term monitoring, which would reduce the cost of monitoring programs. The principal component analysis in the present study area is assisted to facilitate the determination of assemblages of groundwater quality results, which explain the genetic processes and points of origin of pollutants of residential and agricultural zones for mitigating the adverse effects caused by the inferior quality of water on the human health as well as on plant growth for sustainable development. Hence, the application of the principal component analysis can be used as a complementary tool in the hydrogeochemical analysis of any region and helps to plan appropriate management measures in time to control and improve the groundwater quality.

Fishing intensity (15% and 25% of biomass removed per year at Sumilon and Apo, respectively) was high enough to affect total community biomass, but not density, significantly.

Responses to fishing were interpreted in terms of life histories of fish. The intensity of fishing and fish life histories were generally good predictors of the differential rates of decline and recovery of abundance in response to fishing. Large predators had vulnerable life histories (low rates of natural mortality, growth and recruitment) and were subjected to high intensity fishing. They declined significantly in density when fished and increased significantly but slowly when protected from fishing. Caesionidae, a family with a life history resilient to fishing (high rates of natural mortality, growth and recruitment) but fished intensively also declined rapidly in abundance when fished.

Acanthuridae were fished relatively hard and had a life history of intermediate vulnerability but displayed weak responses to fishing.

Three families with intermediate vulnerability and subjected to intermediate to light fishing (F.

On the other hand, the success of individual nurseries appeared to depend on human and social \"start-up\" capital being provided by group nurseries through previous training. In the absence of rigorous valuation of the longer-term effects of both types of nurseries in building natural, human and social capital, it appears that both have a role to play in meeting local demand for tree seedlings. Results generally suggest that smallholder farmers can play a pivotal role in providing tree germplasm for the development of sustainable land use systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Emphasis has been laid on human health and performance care as well as advanced life support developments including bioregenerative life support systems and environmental monitoring. The overall study goals were as follows: (i) to define reference scenarios for a European participation in human exploration and to estimate their influence on the life sciences and life support requirements; (ii) for selected mission scenarios, to critically assess the limiting factors for human health, wellbeing, and performance and to recommend relevant countermeasures; (iii) for selected mission scenarios, to critically assess the potential of advanced life support developments and to propose a European strategy including terrestrial applications; (iv) to critically assess the feasibility of existing facilities and technologies on ground and in space as testbeds in preparation for human exploratory missions and to develop a test plan for ground and space campaigns; (v) to develop a roadmap for a future European strategy towards human exploratory missions, including preparatory activities and terrestrial applications and benefits. This paper covers the part of the HUMEX study dealing with lunar missions. A lunar base at the south pole where long-time sunlight and potential water ice deposits could be assumed was selected as the Moon reference scenario. The impact on human health, performance and well being has been investigated from the view point of the effects of microgravity (during space travel), reduced gravity (on the Moon) and abrupt gravity changes (during launch and landing), of the effects of cosmic radiation including solar particle events, of psychological issues as well as general health care. Countermeasures as well as necessary research using ground-based test beds and/or the International Space Station have been defined. Likewise advanced life support systems with a high degree of autonomy and regenerative capacity and synergy effects were considered where bioregenerative life support systems and biodiagnostic systems become essential. Finally, a European strategy leading to a potential European participation in future human exploratory missions has been recommended. \u00a9 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, the European Space Agency (ESA) has conducted a study on the human responses, limits and needs for such exploratory missions, the so-called HUMEX study (ESA SP-1264). Based on a critical assessment of the limiting factors for human health and performance and the definition of the life science and life support requirements performed in the frame of the HUMEX study, the following major critical items have been identified: (i) radiation health risks, mainly occurring during the interplanetary transfer phases and severely augmented in case of an eruption of a solar particle event; (ii) health risks caused by extended periods in microgravity with an unacceptable risk of bone fracture as a consequence of bone demineralisation; (iii) psychological risks as a consequence of long-term isolation and confinement in an environment so far not experienced by humans; (iv) the requirement of bioregenerative life support systems complementary to physico-chemical systems, and of in situ resource utilisation to reach a closure of the life support system to the highest degree possible. Considering these constraints, it has been concluded that substantial research and development activities are required in order to provide the basic information for appropriate integrated risk managements, including efficient countermeasures and tailored life support. Methodological approaches should include research on the ISS, on robotic precursors missions to Mars, in ground-based simulation facilities as well as in analogue natural environments on Earth. \u00a9 2005 COSPAR."}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Bernhardt, A M", "Biksey, T M", "Isbister, C", "Marion, B", "Schultz, A C"]}, "title": "Ecological and human health risk assessment", "publication_year": 2009, "citation_id": 3065, "doi": null, "abstract": "This literature review covers the risk assessment process and addresses both ecological and human receptors. 1The review covers the risk assessment literature including methodology, analysis, interpretation, management, uncertainty, policy, and regulatory guidance.

A graduate program for community health nurses (CHNs) in a large Midwestern city formed a partnership with a diverse, integrated neighborhood for the dual purposes of enhancing the community's capacity to improve its own health and teaching CHNs community organizing as a means to improve health. Central to the partnership are a broad definition of health, trust developed through long-term involvement, a commitment to reciprocity, social justice, and Freire's model of adult learning. Two initiatives that gave rise to major conflicts between community groups are analyzed. Conflicts, external and internal to the community, proved to be both powerful catalysts and potential barriers to the use of Freirian themes in community organization. Both university and community participants report needing better skills in the early recognition and management of conflict. We conclude that conflict management theory must be integrated with empowerment education theory, particularly when empowerment education is applied in a diverse community."}, {"authors": null, "title": "<Environmental-Impacts-of-Hyraulic-Fracturing-in-Nova-Scotia-A-public-participatory-approach.pdf>", "publication_year": null, "citation_id": 28643, "doi": null, "abstract": null}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Stone, R"]}, "title": "Living in the shadow of Chornobyl", "publication_year": 2001, "citation_id": 24525, "doi": null, "abstract": "Fifteen years after the world's worst nuclear accident, the entire population of Belarus is involuntarily taking part in a decades-long experiment on how radiation affects human health."}, {"authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Stone, R"]}, "title": "The Doing Undone: Vagrancies for the Acoustic City", "publication_year": 2012, "citation_id": 24526, "doi": null, "abstract": null}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Bernhardt, A M", "Biksey, T M", "Marion, B", "Peterson, C", "Schultz, A C", "Smith, P"]}, "title": "Ecological and human health risk assessment", "publication_year": 2011, "citation_id": 3067, "doi": null, "abstract": "This literature review covers the risk assessment process and addresses both ecological and human receptors.

A number of PBRs have been prepared in different parts of India beginning 1995 through initiatives of NGOs and educational institutions working with local communities and village councils. These attempts have been motivated by a desire to promote decentralised systems of management of natural resources and to create the basis for equitable sharing of benefits of commercial utilisation of folk knowledge of uses of biodiversity. The documents bring together important locality specific information on biodiversity resources and ecological processes affecting them. They lead to recognition of conservation oriented local practices such as protection of sacred groves. They help mobilise local communities to prudently manage local biodiversity resources in ways that would promote social justice. It is however important to recognise that not all folk knowledge may be valid, nor all folk practices wise, and to create systems of careful assessment of the material. There are many encouraging signs globally, as well as within India, such as the coming in force of the Convention on Biological Diversity, forces promoting decentralised democratic systems of governance and institutions of co-management of natural resources which suggest that programmes like PBR will have an important role to play in promoting conservation, sustainable use and equitable sharing of benefits of biodiversity resources in the coming decades. \u00a9 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers."}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"authors": {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": ["Dawson, R B", "Landry, S D"]}, "title": "What is the current regulatory status and future landscape for flame retardants?", "publication_year": 2009, "citation_id": 7058, "doi": null, "abstract": "The use of flame retardants has resulted in a substantial reduction in fire deaths.
