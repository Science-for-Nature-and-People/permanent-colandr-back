Rates and patterns of ill health are determined by factors such as socioeconomic development, educational attainment, technological developments, and their dispersion among populations, as well as exposure to hazards such as tobacco. As part of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), we developed three scenarios of future mortality and disability for different age-sex groups, causes, and regions. Methods: We used the most important disease and injury trends since 1950 in nine cause-of-death clusters. Regression equations for mortality rates for each cluster by region were developed from gross domestic product per person (in international dollars), average number of years of education, time (in years, as a surrogate for technological change), and smoking intensity, which shows the cumulative effects based on data for 47 countries in 1950-90. Optimistic, pessimistic, and baseline projections of the independent variables were made. We related mortality from detailed causes to mortality from a cause cluster to project more detailed causes. Based on projected numbers of deaths by cause, years of life lived with disability (YLDs) were projected from different relation models of YLDs to years of life lost (YLLs). Population projections were prepared from World Bank projections of fertility and the projected mortality rates. Findings: Life expectancy at birth for women was projected to increase in all three scenarios; in established market economies to about 90 years by 2020. Far smaller gains in male life expectancy were projected than in females; in formerly socialist economies of Europe, male life expectancy may not increase at all. Worldwide mortality from communicable maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders was expected to decline in the baseline scenario from 17.2 million deaths in 1990 to 10.3 million in 2020. We projected that non-communicable disease mortality will increase from 28.1 million deaths in 1990 to 49.7 million in 2020. Deaths from injury may increase from 5.1 million to 8.4 million. Leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) predicted by the baseline model were (in descending order): ischaemic heart disease, unipolar major depression, road-traffic accidents, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, war injuries, diarrhoeal diseases, and HIV. Tobacco-attributable mortality is projected to increase from 3.0 million deaths in 1990 to 8.4 million deaths in 2020. Interpretation: Health trends in the next 25 years will be determined mainly by the ageing of the world's population, the decline in age-specific mortality rates from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders, the spread of HIV, and the increase in tobacco-related mortality and disability. Projections, by their nature, are highly uncertain, but we found some robust results with implications for health policy. As part of the Global Burden of Disease Study, three scenarios of future mortality and disability were identified. The scenarios were based on future health status as a function of projected changes in key socioeconomic variables that influence health status. Regression equations for mortality rates for nine cause-of-death clusters were developed by region based on gross domestic product per person, average number of years of education, time (as a proxy for technological change), and smoking intensity. Life expectancy at birth was projected, in all three scenarios, to increase for women (to about 90 years in established market economies by 2020), with far smaller gains in male life expectancy. Worldwide, annual mortality from communicable maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders (group 1 causes) is expected to decline from 17.2 million to 10.3 million in 2020 in the baseline model. Also expected is a very large increase in deaths from non-communicable diseases (group 2 causes) from 28.1 million in 1990 to 49.7 million in 2020. Deaths from injuries (group 3) are projected to increase from 5.1 million to 8.4 million. Diarrheal diseases, perinatal disorders, measles, and malaria are expected to decline dramatically as causes of death in the 1990-2020 period, while lung cancer, stomach cancer, war injuries, liver cancer, and HIV are expected to move up five or more places in the ranking. In 2020, the 10 leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years (in descending order) are projected to be ischemic heart disease, unipolar major depression, road traffic accidents, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, war injuries, diarrheal diseases, and HIV. Tobacco-attributable mortality is projected to increase from 3.0 million in 1990 to 8.4 million in 2020 (9% of the worldwide mortality burden)."}, {"doi": "10.1126/science.274.5288.740", "publication_year": 1996, "title": "Evidence-based health policy - Lessons from the global burden of disease study", "authors": {"__value__": ["Lopez, A.D.", "Murray, C.J.L."], "__class__": "tuple"}, "abstract": null}], "__class__": "tuple"}, {"__value__": [{"doi": null, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Particle based two-way coupling of fluid and deformable solid", "authors": {"__value__": ["Guo, J.-X.", "Han, J.", "Liao, X.-Y.", "Yang, C.", "Yuan, Z.-Y."], "__class__": "tuple"}, "abstract": "A two-way coupling algorithm of fluid and deformable solid was proposed.

Meanwhile, fully applicable fluid-solid coupling algorithm in particle-based model of high robustness was not common, and the two-way coupling related research was rarer. Therefore, a particle-based two-way coupling algorithm was proposed based on the law of momentum conservation, which simulated coupling process by pressure and friction forces. The algorithm did not require the vector information in particle-based model, did not need to capture the surface particles of the model, and took the energy loss due to friction into account when coupling. Experimental results show that the two-way coupling algorithm can efficiently handle the coupling simulation between fluid and deformable solid. \u00a9 Copyright;."}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.foreco.2013.09.002", "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Effects of rainwater harvesting on plant growth, soil water dynamics and herbaceous biomass during rehabilitation of degraded hills in Rajasthan, India", "authors": {"__value__": ["Mishra, D.", "Parmar, R.", "Singh, G.", "Singh, K."], "__class__": "tuple"}, "abstract": "Degraded hills can be restored by afforestation and conserving soil and water through rainwater harvesting.

Soil water content (SWC), height and collar diameter of Acacia catechu, Azadirachta indicia, Emblica officinalis, Holoptelia integrifolia and Zyziphus mauritiana planted in August 2005, herbaceous biomass and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interceptions by tree, vegetation and tree-vegetation combine (PARintT/V/C) were monitored for suitability of RWH devices and tree species in rehabilitation. SWC decreased from December to June and it was linearly related to rainfall and vegetation height. PARint by tree, vegetation, and tree-vegetation combine were 30.0%, 54.6% and 84.6%, respectively and helped conserve soil water. SWC, plant and vegetation growth and PARintT were lowest (P&lt;0.05), whereas herbaceous biomass and PARintV were highest in 10-20% slope. Vegetation height and SWC were linearly related to biomass indicating improvement in micro-climate and herbaceous growth. Highest SWC in &lt;10% slope promoted plant growth and mean annual increment (MAI) in height and collar diameter, which enhanced PARintT and PARintC. These variables were highest in CT/BT treatments and lowest in control plots. Characteristic root distribution of Acacia catechu and A. indica promoted growth in V-ditch, whereas E. officinalis, Z. mauritiana and H. integrefolia performed best in CT treatment. RWH enhanced herbaceous biomass between 22.4% and 60.7% over control. Conclusively, VD/GD structures found best for growth of herbaceous vegetation as well as A. catechu and A. indica plants, whereas CT/BT structures favoured growth of other tree species. Rainfall influenced SWC, but RWH helped conserve soil and water, promoted plantation and herbaceous growth and facilitated restoration process, and may be promoted to restore degrading lands. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V."}], "__class__": "tuple"}, {"__value__": [{"doi": "10.12705/626.38", "publication_year": 2013, "title": "(2253) Proposal to conserve the name Crassinervia against Dolerophyllum (fossil Gymnospermae: Vojnovskyales)", "authors": {"__value__": ["Doweld, A.B."], "__class__": "tuple"}, "abstract": null}, {"doi": "10.12705/626.30", "publication_year": 2013, "title": "(2242) Proposal to conserve the name Calamodendron against Calamitea (fossil Equisetophyta: Calamitopsida)", "authors": {"__value__": ["Doweld, A.B."], "__class__": "tuple"}, "abstract": null}], "__class__": "tuple"}, {"__value__": [{"doi": "10.1088/0067-0049/192/2/18", "publication_year": 2011, "title": "Seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (WMAP*) observations: Cosmological interpretation", "authors": {"__value__": ["Bennett, C.L.", "Dunkley, J.", "Gold, B.", "Halpern, M.", "Hill, R.S.", "Hinshaw, G.", "Jarosik, N.", "Kogut, A.", "Komatsu, E.", "Larson, D.", "Limon, M.", "Meyer, S.S.", "Nolta, M.R.", "Odegard, N.", "Page, L.", "Smith, K.M.", "Spergel, D.N.", "Tucker, G.S.", "Weiland, J.L.", "Wollack, E.", "Wright, E.L."], "__class__": "tuple"}, "abstract": "The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ACDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 \u00b1 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich- Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, \u03a3m\u03bd &lt; 0.58 eV (95% CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, Neff = 4.34 +0.86 -0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is \u03c9 = -1.10 \u00b1 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 \u00b10.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21\u03c3, compared with 13\u03c3 from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to \u0394\u03b1 = - 1\u00b0.1 \u00b1 1\u00b0.4(statistical) \u00b1 1\u00b0.5(systematic) (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from \"universal profile\" of Arnaud et al, analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration. \u00a9 2011.

We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model.

We provide a set of WMAP distance priors, to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a timedependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33 &lt; 1 + w0 &lt; 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively.
