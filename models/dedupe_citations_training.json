Modulation of the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) produced in the target muscle during rTMS showed a pattern of inhibitory and excitatory effects which depended on the rTMS frequency and intensity. With the magnetic coil situated over the optimal scalp position for activating the abductor pollicis brevis, rTMS led to spread of excitation, as evident from the induction of progressively larger MEPs in the other muscles. The number of pulses inducing this spread of excitation decreased with increasing rTMS frequency and intensity. Latency of the MEPs produced in the other muscles during the spread of excitation was significantly longer than that produced by single-pulse TMS applied to the optimal scalp positions for their activation. The difference in MEP latency could be explained by a delay in intracortical conduction along myelinated cortico-cortical pathways. Following rTMS, a 3-4 min period of increased excitability was demonstrated by an increase in the amplitude of MEPs produced in the target muscles by single-pulse TMS. Nevertheless, repeated rTMS trains applied 1 min apart led to similar modulation of the responses and to spread of excitation after approximately the same number of pulses. This suggests that the spread might be due to the breakdown of inhibitory connections or the recruitment of excitatory pathways, whereas the post-stimulation facilitation may be due to a transient increase in the efficacy of excitatory synapses.", "publication_year": 1994, "authors": {"__value__": ["AF PASCUALLEONE, A", "HALLETT, M", "HALLETT, M", "PASCUALLEONE, A", "VALLSSOLE, J", "VALLSSOLE, J", "WASSERMANN, EM", "WASSERMANN, EM"], "__class__": "tuple"}, "doi": "10.1093/brain/117.4.847"}, {"title": "Image denoising via sparse and redundant representations over learned dictionaries", "abstract": "We address the image denoising problem, where zero-mean white and homogeneous Gaussian additive noise is to be removed from a given image.

Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself, or training on a corpus of high-quality image database. Since the K-SVD is limited in handling small image patches, we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location in the image.

Few studies quantify population consequences of individual stressors, and fewer quantify synergistic effects. Incorporating all sources of uncertainty can cause predictions to span the range from negligible to catastrophic. Two places were identified to bound this problem through energetic mechanisms that reduce prey available to individuals. First, the US Marine Mammal Protection Act's Potential Biological Removal (PBR) equation was used as a placeholder allowable harm limit to represent the number of animals that can be removed annually without depleting a population below agreed-upon management targets. That rephrased the research question from, \"How big could cumulative impacts be?\" to \"How big would cumulative impacts have to be to exceed an agreed-upon threshold?\" Secondly, two data-rich case studies, namely Gulf of Maine humpback and northeast Pacific resident killer whales, were used as examples to parameterize the weakest link, namely between prey availability and demography. Given no additional information, the model predicted that human activities need only reduce prey available to the killer whale population by ~10% to cause a population-level take, through reduced fecundity and/or survival, equivalent to PBR. By contrast, in the humpback population, reduction in prey availability of ~50% was needed to cause a similar, PBR-sized effect. The paper describes an approach - results are merely illustrative. The two case studies differ in prey specialization, life history, and, no doubt, proximity to carrying capacity. This method of inverting the problem refocuses discussions around what the level of prey depletion - via competition with commercial fisheries, displacement from feeding areas through noise-generating activities, or acoustic masking of signals used to detect prey - would have to occur to exceed allowable harm limits set for lethal takes in fisheries or other, more easily quantifiable, human activities. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.", "publication_year": 2016, "authors": {"__value__": ["Ashe, E.a", "Clark, C.W.c", "Hammond, P.S.a", "Thomas, L.b", "Williams, R.a"], "__class__": "tuple"}, "doi": "10.1016/j.marpol.2016.04.023"}], "__class__": "tuple"}, {"__value__": [{"title": "Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) analysis of pump thrombosis in the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device", "abstract": "Background Pump thrombosis remains an uncommon but potentially catastrophic complication of durable continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). A perceived increase in the incidence of pump thrombosis in the HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) by clinicians prompted this analysis of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database. Methods Between 2006 and June 2013, 8,988 United States patients aged older than 18 years received a durable LVAD. Of these, 6,910 adult patients from 132 institutions who received a HMII LVAD were entered in the INTERMACS database and constitute the study group for this analysis. Results Overall survival (with censoring at transplant or explant for recovery) with the HMII LVAD was 80% at 1 year and 69% at 2 years and was not significantly different when stratified by era of implant. Freedom from device exchange or death due to thrombosis decreased from 99% at 6 months in 2009 to 94% in 2012 (p < 0.0001). Multivariable hazard function analysis showed risk factors for pump thrombosis included later implant year (p < 0.0001), younger age (p < 0.0001), higher creatinine (p = 0.002), larger body mass index (p = 0.004), white race (p = 0.0004), left ventricular ejection fraction above 20% (p = 0.02), and higher lactate dehydrogenase level at 1 month (p < 0.0001). Survival (p < 0.0001) and freedom from infection (p = 0.008) and cerebrovascular accident (p < 0.0001) were lower after pump exchange than after primary implant. Conclusions Pump exchange or death due to pump thrombosis increased during 2011 and 2012, but the magnitude of the increase remained relatively small. Survival remains high (80% at 1 year) with the HMII LVAD. Risk factor analysis suggests that a number of patient-related factors contribute to the risk of thrombosis. Markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase in the first month is a predictor of pump thrombosis. This analysis could not examine the potential role of technical factors during implant, such as sub-optimal pump or graft positioning, changes in patient management paradigms with pump speed settings, improved recognition and change in the threshold for pump exchange, or design or production changes with the pump, as contributors to the risk of pump thrombosis. \u00a9 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.", "publication_year": 2014, "authors": {"__value__": ["Acker, M.A.e", "Baldwin, J.T.i", "Goldstein, D.L.f", "Kirklin, J.K.a", "Kormos, R.L.b", "Milano, C.A.h", "Miller, M.A.i", "Myers, S.L.a", "Naftel, D.C.a", "Pagani, F.D.c", "Pinney, S.j", "Rame, J.E.e", "Silvestry, S.C.g", "Stevenson, L.W.d"], "__class__": "tuple"}, "doi": "10.1016/j.healun.2013.11.001"}, {"title": "Breast cancer in China", "abstract": "The health burden of cancer is increasing in China, with more than 1\u00b76 million people being diagnosed and 1\u00b72 million people dying of the disease each year.

Method and Results Patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (1482) were included in the study, which had two phases. In an open, acute phase (days 1 to 6), patients were assigned either twice-daily weight-adjusted subcutaneous injections of dalteparin (120 IU/kg) or dose-adjusted intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin. In the double-blind, prolonged treatment phase (days 6 to 45), patients received subcutaneously either dalteparin (7500 IU once daily) or placebo.

Both time-dependent and time-averaged cooling effectiveness distributions on the rotor under the influence of shock waves and unsteady wake flows are presented with blowing ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5. The results show that (a) the unsteady wake passing caused by the blade rotation significantly influences the time-dependent pressure coefficients, especially in the forward region downstream of the stagnation point on both the suction and pressure sides on the rotor. This effect can be evidenced by the \"wrapping behavior\" of a strong vorticity field wrapping around the blade leading edge after the wake hit the blade (b) On the suction side, over the crown area of the rotor, the wake-induced pressure fluctuations are augmented by the weak shock wave emanating from the stator's trailing edge, appearing as a primary peak followed by a secondary peak. The weak oblique shock wave can be evidenced by the dense Mach contour curves. The effect of the wake (rotational) is distinguished from that of the shock (inviscid and non-rotational) by comparing the pressure gradient field with the vorticity field. (c) Similar effects of passing wakes and shock waves on the surface pressure on a rotor are observed on the film cooling effectiveness, except that these effects are of the same magnitude. (d) The effect of the blowing ratio on the static pressure distribution at the rotor wall is not significant, whereas its effect on the film cooling effectiveness is more pronounced.

Part 1 is focused on the development of the computational model and methodology of the system setup and model qualification; Part 2 is to investigate the unsteady effects of shock waves and wakes on film cooling performance in a transonic rotating stage. In Part 1, the film cooling experimental conditions (non-rotating) and test sections of Kopper et. al. and Hunter are selected for model qualification. The numerical computation is carried out by the commercial software Ansys/Fluent using the pressure based compressible flow governing equations. The effects of four turbulence models are carefully compared with the experimental data. The Realizable k-e turbulence model is found to match the experimental data better than the other models and is thus used for the rest of the study, including Part 2. The results show that 1) the weak shock emanating from the neighboring stator's trailing edge results in a temperature rise and a reduction of film cooling effectiveness on the suction side near the trailing edge, 2) cooling ejection from the trailing edge reduces the shock strength in the stator passage, 3) an increase in Mach number from 0.84 to 1.50 can reduce the total pressure losses of fluid flow near the end-walls, 4) the film cooling effectiveness increases with increasing blowing ratio and becomes more even on the stator with a higher blowing ratio, and 5) an increase in Mach number from 0.84 to 1.50 gives rise to a higher cooling effectiveness in the region from the cooling holes to 80% of the chord length of the stator on the pressure side, but becomes lower after this up to the trailing edge. However, on the stator's suction side, higher Mach number results in a lower cooling effectiveness region around the film holes from 30% to 55% of the chord length, but cooling effectiveness increases downstream.

The scale is a clinician-rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms) (total range, 0 to 40), with separate subtotals for severity of obsessions and compulsions. In a study involving four raters and 40 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder at various stages of treatment, interrater reliability for the total Yale-Brown Scale score and each of the 10 individual items was excellent, with a high degree of internal consistency among all item scores demonstrated with Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient. Based on pretreatment assessment of 42 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, each item was frequently endorsed and measured across a range of severity. These findings suggest that the Yale-Brown Scale is a reliable instrument for measuring the severity of illness in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with a range of severity and types of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. \u00a9 1989, American Medical Association.

The total Yale-Brown Scale score was significantly correlated with two of three independent measures of obsessive-compulsive disorder and weakly correlated with measures of depression and of anxiety in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with minimal secondary depressive symptoms.

In 1980, 87,245 female nurses 34 to 59 years of age who were free of diagnosed cardiovascular disease and cancer completed dietary questionnaires that assessed their consumption of a wide range of nutrients, including vitamin E. During follow-up of up to eight years (679,485 person-years) that was 97 percent complete, we documented 552 cases of major coronary disease (437 nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 115 deaths due to coronary disease).

As compared with women in the lowest fifth of the cohort with respect to vitamin E intake, those in the top fifth had a relative risk of major coronary disease of 0.66 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.87) after adjustment for age and smoking. Further adjustment for a variety of other coronary risk factors and nutrients, including other antioxidants, had little effect on the results. Most of the variability in intake and reduction in risk was attributable to vitamin E consumed as supplements. Women who took vitamin E supplements for short periods had little apparent benefit, but those who took them for more than two years had a relative risk of major coronary disease of 0.59 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 0.91) after adjustment for age, smoking status, risk factors for coronary disease, and use of other antioxidant nutrients (including multivitamins). Conclusions. Although these prospective data do not prove a cause-and-effect relation, they suggest that among middle-aged women the use of vitamin E supplements is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease.

In recent years, the Statistical Update has undergone some major changes with the addition of new chapters and major updates across multiple areas, as well as increasing the number of ways to access and use the information assembled. For this year's edition, the Statistics Committee, which produces the document for the AHA, updated all of the current chapters with the most recent nationally representative data and inclusion of relevant articles from the literature over the past year. This year's edition includes a new chapter on peripheral artery disease, as well as new data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, with additional new focus on evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors, implementation strategies, and implications of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals.

In early studies, there was a small survival advantage with CABG surgery compared with PCI without stenting. The addition of stents and newer adjunctive medications improved the outcome for PCI. The decision to recommend PCI or CABG surgery will be guided by technical improvements in cardiology or surgery, local expertise, and patients' preference. However, until proved otherwise, PCI should be used only with reservation in diabetics with multi-vessel disease and in patients with unprotected left main stenosis. The use of drug-eluting stents might change this situation. Patients presenting with NSTE-ACS (UA or NSTEMI) have to be stratified first for their risk of acute thrombotic complications. A clear benefit from early angiography (< 48 h) and, when needed, PCI or CABG surgery has been reported only in the high-risk groups. Deferral of intervention does not improve outcome. Routine stenting is recommended on the basis of the predictability of the result and its immediate safety. In patients with STEMI, primary PCI should be the treatment of choice in patients presenting in a hospital with PCI facility and an experienced team. Patients with contra-indications to thrombolysis should be immediately transferred for primary PCI, because this might be their only chance for quickly opening the coronary artery. In cardiogenic shock, emergency PCI for complete revascularization may be life-saving and should be considered at an early stage. Compared with thrombolysis, randomized trials that transferred the patients for primary PCI to a 'heart attack centre' observed a better clinical outcome, despite transport times leading to a significantly longer delay between randomization and start of the treatment. The superiority of primary PCI over thrombolysis seems to be especially clinically relevant for the time interval between 3 and 12 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms on the basis of its superior preservation of myocardium. Furthermore, with increasing time to presentation, major-adverse-cardiac-event rates increase after thrombolysis, but appear to remain relatively stable after primary PCI. Within the first 3 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms, both reperfusion strategies seem equally effective in reducing infarct size and mortality. Therefore, thrombolysis is still a viable alternative to primary PCI, if it can be delivered within 3 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms. Primary PCI compared with thrombolysis significantly reduced stroke. Overall, we prefer primary PCI over thrombolysis in the first 3 h of chest pain to prevent stroke, and in patients presenting 3-12 h after the onset of chest pain, to salvage myocardium and also to prevent stroke. At the moment, there is no evidence to recommend facilitated PCI. Rescue PCI is recommended, if thrombolysis failed within 45-60 min after starting the administration. After successful thrombolysis, the use of routine coronary angiography within 24 h and PCI, if applicable, is recommended even in asymptomatic patients without demonstrable ischaemia to improve patients' outcome. If a PCI centre is not available within 24 h, patients who have received successful thrombolysis with evidence of spontaneous or inducible ischaemia before discharge should be referred to coronary angiography and revascularized accordingly-independent of 'maximal' medical therapy. \u00a9 The European Society of Cardiology 2005.
