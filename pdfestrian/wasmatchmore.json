However, the potential of NTFPs to contribute to development remained limited and open to doubt. The study objectives were to: (i) analyze the role of NTFPs livelihood strategies in rural development in order to explain their potentials and failures; and (ii) identify and analyze the factors influencing the contribution of NTFPs livelihood strategies to household income. The study was carried out analyzing three NTFPs in Rashad locality in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan in 2008–2009. The data were collected through interviews, direct observations and market surveys. Purposive sampling technique was applied to select 221 and 62 collector and trader households, respectively. The results revealed that Adansonia digitata fruit sale represents a subsistence strategy for some sampled households and accumulative strategy for others, while Ziziphus spina-christi and Balanites aegyptiaca fruits sale is a subsistence strategy for all the surveyed households. The study results also showed that the income from selling the fruits was positively and negatively influenced by different external and internal factors. The study concluded that any assumption regarding the potential of NTFPs to positively affect rural development depends on their role in an accumulative strategy that lifts people out of poverty. Institutional, technical and financial supports are necessary to influence the future direction of the NTFP contribution toward accumulative strategy.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":3}

Lake Chad was formerly the sixth largest Lake and second largest in the World and Africa respectively, the size of the Lake has drastically reduced. As part of the restoration processes, water quality has been an aspect under consideration in the improvement of the Lake Chad. The research projects tend to determine the attitude and expectation of the communals living along the Lake Chad Shore, in terms of water resources management. In this survey, three communities were choosen-namely Baga (Nigeria), Bol (Chad Republic) and N'guigmi (Niger). This is not a peer-reviewed article 21st Century Watershed Technology Workshops: Improving Water Quality and the Environment CD 269-932-7004 (2950 Niles Road, St. Joseph, MI 49085-9659 USA).

Structured-and unstructured questionnaires were administered. Results indcates that, the proportion of male respondents outnumber the female respondents, this is due to cultural barrier. On the recent Oil exploration development in the Lake Chad Basin, the proportion of respondents who are supportative in the Oil exploration is 53.3% and 10.0% in Baga and Bol respectively. In comparison, to the proportion of respondents who are unsupportive to the exploration is 13.3% and 23.3% in Baga and Bol respectively. In the water resources management of the Lake Chad, survey shows that 16.7% and 30.0% of the respondents treat their drinking water in Baga and Bol communities respectively while 53.3% and 60.0% untreat their drinking water in Baga and Bol communities.

This study aims to investigate how farmers affected by community forestry have adapted to its introduction and whether their livelihood options have changed in response to changes in forest accessibility and forest product availability. A total of 309 households were interviewed in eight forest user groups in the middle hills of Nepal and results on reported changes in forest product collection and livestock numbers analysed. Reported forest product collection has increased since the introduction of community forestry, while livestock numbers have decreased. The main findings of the study are that, despite controlled access to the forest, collection rates have increased slightly in the majority of income groups and households. The number of trees on private land has increased, while the size of livestock herds has decreased. As long as the farmers can continue to adapt without adversely affecting their livelihoods they will support this forestry management system leading to an increased chance of the long term success of common property forest management in Nepal.

M.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION The global trend of land use change toward simplification and agricultural intensification is a leading cause of biodiversity loss that threatens ecosystem services and their ability to sustain human welfare (Alcamo and Bennett 2003). Agricultural intensification is a primary concern in centers of crop domestication (Harlan 1975) where human-environment interactions have fostered ecological knowledge and landscape, species, and genetic diversity (Jarvis et al. 2007). As economic incentives, infrastructure, and reforms drive land use intensification, indigenous agroecosystems may provide an effective model for the reconciliation between biodiversity conservation and agriculture (Brush and Meng 1998). The southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan provides a compelling human ecosystem for examining land use because of its extraordinary biological and cultural diversity that is threatened by dramatic economic and political change ( ). Yunnan is home to 26 state-designated sociolinguistic groups and at least 18,000 vascular plant species (Li and Walker 1986). Southern Yunnan is in a global biodiversity (Dijk et al. 1999) and biocultural diversity (Stepp et al. 2005) hotspot located between two Vavilov centers of crop domestication (Turrill 1926). It is notable as an ancient crossroads of migration and regional trade between Southeast Asia, India, and Tibet (Yang 2004). Yunnan is also part of the Southeast Asian region recently labeled as 'Zomia' (Schendel 2001) that is characterized by highland cultures that historically fled state organized societies and maintained deliberate stateless structures (Scott 2009). Over the past 50 years, southern Yunnan has experienced substantial agricultural intensification as subtropical forests and indigenous agriculture have transitioned into monoculture systems of tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis, Euphorbiaceae), and other cash crops. The proliferation of monocultures has been driven by expanding markets for natural resources coinciding with the opening of China's economy and national development efforts emphasizing modern modes of production. Rubber plantations have replaced approximately 500,000 ha of forest and traditional smallholder agroecosystems in southern Yunnan and neighboring Southeast Asia (Zeigler et al. 2009). Intensified land use in this region is expected to increase to 1.0 -1.5 million ha by 2050 (Zeigler et al. 2009). Despite the prevalence of monocultures with market expansion, indigenous low-intensity agrarian practices persist in some upland communities, such as tea agroforests. The present study examines socio-cultural valuation of land use, persistence of indigenous agrarian practices, and ecological knowledge (Hunn 1993, Ellen and Harris 2000, Rocha 2005) of tea varietals in an Akha community in midelevation montane southern Yunnan. Research was conducted over the period 2005 to 2009, corresponding with a tea market boom cycle in Yunnan to assess how land use valuation and ecological knowledge respond to increased market integration. This study provides an understanding of land use decision making from the perspective of rural households as they transform from subsistence economies of regional trade to participants in globalization.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":884}

Using a sample of 182 respondents around the Kakum National Park in Ghana's Central Region, an area which is rich in tourism assets but economically poor, it examines residents' expectations, experiences and perceptions about tourism development in the area. While some expectations were too much, others had been met, if only somewhat. Residents' experiences in terms of direct socioeconomic benefits were modest. But largely on account of indirect gains from a range of pro-poor interventions, the majority had a fairly positive perception of tourism in the area. Respondents of communities beyond the Park's reception area had gained more from associated interventions rather than from tourism. Age and place of birth were also found to be key variables that influenced residents' perspectives on tourism development in the area. Nevertheless, residents' overall perception suggests that sustainable tourism development requires an approach that simultaneously improves the tourism product and enhances residents' livelihood options. The need for residents to be involved in decision-making if pro-poor tourism is to be successful was underlined.","doi":"10.1080/09669582.2010.509508","journal":{"name":"Journal of Sustainable Tourism","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":5}

Water is one of the most important natural resources, and its effective management is essential given its scarcity. In rural Sri Lanka, the management of available water resources needs special attention because investment for water resource improvement is hard to obtain, and water itself is relatively scarce in the drier areas of the country. The Wanaraniya Water Project pipes water 6.5km from its source to individual houses in the village, saving women daily time and effort. The project is founded on commitments to community participation and the adoption of local knowledge. It was initiated by women, and has been operated and managed by them for the last six years. This study argues that the project can serve as a model for better planning of water management, and focuses on the unique strategies and innovative methods that have been used. In particular, it shows the impact of involvement in the project on women's empowerment.

E. and Fermin A. C. and Agbayani R. F.","dAbstract":"The vicious cycle of poverty, overfishing and resource degradation in coastal communities in the Philippines calls for action that will address the problem of declining fish catch and degraded fish habitats. The literature has shown that an efficient and effective coastal management program can be instrumental in approaching this problem. In order to secure food and livelihood of fishers, the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center/Aquaculture Department collaborated with the local government of Anini-y, Antique to develop a sustainable utilization of natural marine resources through sea ranching of abalone within the Nogas Island marine protected area. Establishing a marine protected area is a means of conserving natural stocks while sea ranching is considered an effective strategy that can increase fishery resources. The two management schemes are considered as effective coastal resources management strategies. The success of a sea-ranching project is dependent not only on biophysical but also on socioeconomic factors as determinants of community participation and cooperation. A social assessment was conducted to determine the fishers' socio-cultural characteristics, their perceptions of their coastal resources and knowledge on how to effectively manage these coastal resources. The fishers' awareness on fishing regulations and the extent of their participation in community's coastal resources management activities were also determined. Data were collected from a household survey using a semi-structured questionnaire, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with key informants. The fishers generally scored low in almost all aspects of their socioeconomic wellbeing. Most fishers perceived that their coastal resources were in a bad condition which they attributed to illegal and commercial fishing, increasing number of fishers and the poor enforcement of fishery regulations. However, the weighted mean scores of their knowledge on coastal resources management, awareness to fishery regulations and participation in community coastal resource management activities were average. This implied that fishers when trained and developed can become potential partners for effective coastal resources management programs.","doi":"10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.014","journal":{"name":"Fisheries Research","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":7}

These forest reforms seek to initiate the process of eliminating the main causes of forest depletion through participation of local communities. Nevertheless, despite decades of the donor's interventions the deforestation rate in NWFP is still alarming. In this paper we have attempted to analyze the participatory forest management in Northwest Pakistan through livelihood lenses. More specifically this paper explores the impact of joint forest management initiatives on financial assets and livelihood strategies of local people. The overall results indicated that majority of the respondents were not dependent on the natural resources for their cash income rather they had adopted diverse non-natural resource based activities such as migration, labour etc. The results also indicated that the main priorities of the local people were financial and food security; where as the NWFP model of joint forest management gives more emphasis on forest protection and regeneration. Although the joint forest management enhanced the social assets of the local communities yet the omission of immediate financial benefits from the institutional changes in the forestry sector of NWFP was a barrier in motivating the local people in forest protection and was one of the main issues hindering the effectiveness of the forest reforms process.","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.12.017","journal":null,"aid":8}

This study examined the attitudes of 2915 residents in 97 communities around three protected areas (PAs) in upper Myanmar: Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park in the western mountains, Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary in the hills bordering the Chindwin and Uru rivers, and Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary in the central dry zone. Logistic regression indicated a positive attitude toward the PAs was most highly correlated with a perception of conservation benefits and benefits resulting from management of the areas. Attitude was also significantly correlated with a perception of extraction benefits, conflicts with PA staff and crop damage by wildlife. Socioeconomic variables were less powerful than perceptions in predicting attitude and, unlike perceptions, their effects varied among the areas. The much greater effect of perceptions, especially positive ones, on people's attitudes indicates that understanding perceptions is important to improving the relationship between local residents and these PAs. This finding underscores the fact that a focus on conflicts to understand people's attitudes toward PAs may undervalue or miss critical positive perceptions that people hold. Understanding local residents' perceptions of PAs makes possible the creation of strategic, place-based management strategies that build on people's positive perceptions and mitigate their negative perceptions.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892906003389","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":809}

Eco-lodges are an important component of ecotourism ventures but an infrequently researched component of this fi eld. Considering their infl uence on the natural environment (design and operation) and local communities (employment practices and purchases), the success of ecotourism depends, in part, on the performance of eco-lodges. This project studies the effects of the Punta Islita (PI) eco-lodge on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. An interdisciplinary nested-scale analysis, combining guest and household interviews with multi-temporal remote sensing analysis of forest cover change of the lodge and surrounding areas, is used to evaluate the environmental, economic and social impacts of ecotourism in the region. Our results show signifi cant positive contributions of the PI eco-lodge on forest cover, environmental conservation, and local economic incomes within the surrounding communities. For local livelihoods, the PI eco-lodge was seen as having positive social, cultural and economic impacts for nearly all societal variables for both employees and their neighbours. The PI eco-lodge was also perceived as reducing alcoholism, drug addiction and prostitution, where conventional tourism on the Peninsula was shown to increase these 'societal ills'. Land value and product pricing were the few variables believed to have increased as a result of tourism on the Peninsula. For conservation, the PI eco-lodge property had the highest rates of reforestation within the Nicoya Peninsula and remains the scale most reforested in both forest cover change and total forest cover. In fact, at the landscape scale, we fi nd that the Pacifi c coast of the Nicoya, where the bulk of ecotourism occurs, has undergone reforestation, whereas forest interiors have been deforested. Historically, reforestation occurred as cattle ranching credit programs were halted by the government and households in the area left to fi nd better job opportunities. The PI eco-lodge, as a source of good employment, resulted in worker migration back to the surrounding area, resulting, in some cases, in increased deforestation. Overall, we feel that the PI eco-lodge serves as an example of successful ecotourism. However, increasing development in the region, in particular by standard hotel operations and large condo developments, seeks to capitalise on the region's natural beauty and may reverse land cover trends if they are not accompanied by adequate forest conservation strategies and stresses the importance of monitoring and assessing the impacts of accommodations tied to nature-based tourism operations.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH Int.

{"filename":"Ambinakudige 2011","year":2011,"title":"National Parks, coffee and NTFPs: the livelihood capabilities of Adivasis in Kodagu, India","authors":"Ambinakudige S.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction Poovamma faces another day without paid work. Normally, at this time of year she would be working in the lower valley weeding coffee plantations, but that employment has dried up since the crash in global coffee prices. Years ago, she might have gathered medicinal herbs and green manure in the surrounding forests, but available forest areas are becoming scarce, and park rangers restrict those activities in the remaining forested areas. Her husband, fortunately, is working for one of their patrons this week, pruning shade trees in coffee orchards: men generally do the pruning. Poovamma has been waiting for rain for several weeks now. Once it rains she can get work in the local rice paddy farm, since rice farmers prefer women laborers to transplant rice plants. Tomorrow, she will go to another farm where ginger is cultivated in rice paddies to offset the decline in coffee prices. She decides to spend the morning clearing bushes around the family's house. Since she does not have ownership title on this land inside the boundaries of the National Park, this is a task best done little by little, so as not to attract attention from Park guards. In the afternoon, she goes to a site outside the Park where the village Panchayat (government) is building a kindergarten for children in the tribal area. The Panchayat initiated this project because of Poovamma's persistent efforts as a member of the Panchayat. While returning from the project site, she will bring a head-load of dead and dried twigs for cooking and heating water. She collects firewood during the evening to avoid harassment by forest guards. As in the rest of the world, environmental change is transforming this little tribal area in Kodagu, India where Poovamma makes her living. The transformations of forest to coffee plantation, forest to national parks, and rice paddies to ginger farms bring with them transformations in local livelihood possibilities. Institutional factors ranging from the family structure to village politics to forest policies to global trade agreements shape people's livelihood outcomes. As a social actor, Poovamma has various roles ranging from head of household to tribal woman to member of the local Panchayat. Each of these roles brings different livelihood possibilities and different environmental changes. Any inquiry into conservation and livelihood should address these relations among livelihood possibilities, environmental change, and institutional complexities. Indigenous communities in India are largely referred to as 'Adivasis', meaning original inhabitants. Adivasis like Poovamma in the Kodagu district in Southern India depend on forest resources and agriculture labor to sustain their livelihood. These two major livelihood sources have undergone changes over the years (Ambinakudige 2006). Aggressive conservation policies of the state and creation of Protected Areas have generally restricted Adivasis access to resources and pushed them to market economy (Langton 2005; Lele and Shrinidhi 1998). On the other hand, globalization and the commodification of agriculture have created uncertainties in the livelihood capabilities of Adivasis (Bawa et.al. 2007). Therefore, it is imperative to explore which institutional factors shape Adivasis' livelihood capabilities; how do those institutional factors operate at various scales? How do Adivasis cope with marginalization resulting from conservation policies, and the vagaries of the market economy? To answer these questions, this paper analyzes Adivasis' livelihood capabilities amidst conservation policies, the market economy, and various other institutional factors operating at global, regional, and local scales. Blaikie et.al. (1994) define 'livelihood' as the command an individual, family or other social group has over an income and/or other bundles of resources that can be used or exchanged to satisfy its needs. Therefore, livelihood can refer to the activities of an individual, a family, or a social group. The central concept in the definition of livelihood is \"resources and the command over those resources.\" Rural livelihoods also comprise \"diverse portfolios of activities and social support capabilities for survival and to improve their standard of living\" (Ellis 1998). These livelihood strategies and outcomes are structured by institutional and vulnerability factors (Ruben 2003). Vulnerability factors include the shocks and stresses that people cope with in their livelihood struggles (De Haan 2000). Definition of an institution is complex, and in the academic literature, definitions turn on the theoretical interest and the pragmatics of a research project. According to Crawford and Ostrom (1995), institutions are enduring regularities of human action in situations structured by rules, norms, and shared strategies, as well as by the physical world. These rules, norms, and shared strategies are constituted and reconstituted by human interactions in frequently occurring or repetitive situations (Crawford and Ostrom 1995). Institutional factors that influence livelihood outcomes include policies, legislation, customary laws, the organizational structure and social norms (Ambinakudige 2006). These factors determine which livelihood strategies are open and attractive (Carney 1999). These \"transforming structures and processes\" operate at various levels of society -from family and village, up to the international level of global political and market institutions (Ruben 2003). Organizations, for example NGOs and associations, come into existence and evolve through the influence of the institutional structure. In turn, they influence how institutions evolve (Crawford and Ostrom 1995). Therefore, institutional factors in this study include the existence, evolution, and de facto functioning of organizations, policies, legislation, customary laws, and social norms (Ambinakudige 2006). These factors determine what livelihood strategies are open and attractive (Carney 1999). Analysis of livelihood outcomes, therefore, requires sensitivity to resources, the process of converting them to needed goods and services, and the dynamics of change and social vulnerability to change. The livelihood outcomes of Adivasis and other indigenous peoples are particularly influenced by the institutions and organizations of nature conservation. A conservation policy that distresses people that are less powerful, politically marginalized, and poor, has failed in its goal (Agrawal and Redford, 2009). Unfortunately, most conservation strategies involving the protection of habitats and species through the demarcation of Protected Areas also elevate levels of distress for poor people living in and around them by foreclosing access. For indigenous forest dwellers, nature and livelihood are not separate concepts. The Gimi community in Papua New Guinea for example, does not acknowledge a separation between nature or culture, so Western 'nature conservation' is alien to them and contemporary conservation strategies often fail to recognize this (West and Brockington 2006). Although, their cultural conditions are compatible with contemporary conservation principles (i.e., low settlement densities, limited technology, and largely subsistence production), Adivasis were generally kept away from conservation projects (Holt 2005). Worse, establishing a Protected Area can alienate the land-use rights of native people (Agrawal and Ostrom 2001). Repeatedly, Protected Areas have been shown to restrict rural people's access and use of resources through legislation, enforcement, and some privatization (Greenough 2003). As a result, land-use practices such as gathering wood and hunting can become criminalized (Klooster 2000; Freedman 2002). In addition, Protected Areas involving new economic activities such as park and wildlife tourism create a different scenario where indigenous people find it harder to pursue lifestyles that are more 'traditional'. If they do not want to take part in the new economic activities of a new Protected Area, they find survival difficult, as their subsistence options are limited because of resource-management regulations (Weber 1991). Conservation projects that provide positive benefits to local people from natural resources can enable sustainable management over the long term. Conversely, negative social impacts make conservation more difficult and less sustainable (Bray and Velazquez 2009). Many Indigenous peoples occupy the territories claimed by Protected Areas. Conservation strategies cannot ignore the livelihoods of the large number of poor, powerless people still living in these areas and potentially threatened by eviction. Occupancy rates are hard to estimate – perhaps 56%-72% in India (Kothari et al. 1989) and as high as 85% in South America (Amend and Amend 1995). Adivasi and indigenous livelihood disruption resulting from restriction of access to Protected Areas is complex, and solutions have proven elusive (Sato 2000). Protected Areas potentially expose Adivasis to new, unfamiliar livelihood options such as waged work in the commercial farming sector (usually situated just outside the Protected Area), but this makes them vulnerable to market volatility (Ambinakudige 2006). Over time, commodification of agriculture and thereby market dependency has brought about a structural change in peasant livelihood processes in the form of rising cost of production, increased in-and out-migration, and dependency on export crops (Watts 1983; Bernstein 1994). As livelihoods become more vulnerable to market failure and rising costs of land without guarantees of higher output, the livelihoods of the laborers depending on those farms will also become vulnerable to market volatility. The livelihoods of Adivasis in the study area are not just determined by local institutions. Complex forces, including the global nature of conservation politics, the globalization of local economies and commodification of agriculture all impact on the livelihoods of Adivasis. There is a need to understand this complexity much better, to help protect human rights and to conserve natural resources.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":812}
{"filename":"Ambrose-Oji 2003","year":2003,"title":"106","authors":"","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION In a recent article Arnold and Ruiz Pérez (2001) reviewed the reasons why non-timber forest products 1 (NTFPs) have attracted so much attention during the last couple of decades. Drawing on a number of seminal works they outline three propositions central to the idea that NTFPs might contribute to rural development and forest conservation objectives. These were that NTFPs make important contributions to the livelihoods of forest adjacent communities; that increasing harvests of NTFPs could increase the perceived value of forest resources and hence provide incentives to conserve forested land; and that the exploitation of NTFPs provided a more sustainable base for forest management (Arnold and Ruiz Perez 2001: 438). This paper sets out to look at the first two propositions and revisit the prospects NTFPs hold for sustaining the livelihoods of people living close to forests and for promoting conservation through the 'use it or lose it' philosophy (Freese 1997). During the period that Arnold and Ruiz Pérez consider, there have been other changes to the way in which the conservation and development community view household livelihoods, family incomes and forest valuation methods. More nuanced understandings of the condition of rural and forest margin communities have emerged at the same time as there has been a renewed focus by many donor agencies on the alleviation of poverty ( DFID 1997 DFID 2001 Forsyth et al. 1998; Lipton and Maxwell 1992; Maxwell 2001). Application of a pro-poor focused 'livelihoods approach' to examining and understanding individual or household economies and the ways in which poor groups of people are able to improve their standards of living, has emphasised the fact that natural resources (including NTFPs) are only one set of capital assets available to, and used by the poor as part of their livelihood strategies ( Farrington et al. 1999;). This has forced conservationists, forest managers and development practitioners to move away from sectoral perspectives towards a much broader approach in their understanding of the importance of the various economic activities that make up the livelihoods portfolios of forest margin communities.

Income and asset data were collected from 635 randomly selected households. Data were analysed using propensity score matching models. Results show that in Dodola, where commercial timber harvest is allowed, the introduction of PFM means that FUGs have higher livestock assets and forest income than non-members. The average total income and the expenditure for members and non-members, however, were not significantly different. In Chilimo site, the result is the opposite —the introduction of PFM means that FUG members have lower total incomes and assets than non-members.

These two communities were selected for the study because they are the closest communities to the headquarters of Kakum National Park and therefore may have greater opportunities to interact with the management of KNP and also benefit from tourist activities at KNP. A total of 200 households were initially selected to participate in the survey. The households were selected using a systematic sampling method. This method involves identifying, listing and numbering all the households in the study area. Where S represents the total number of households and R the required number of households to be selected, a skip interval I=S/R was calculated. The first household was selected by adding the interval to a randomly picked number between 1 and the interval. Subsequent households were selected by adding the interval to the last serial number (Afolabi et al. 2004). Twelve households declined to participate in the survey resulting in 188 households who participated in the survey. To increase internal validity a mixed-method approach was adopted in the study. In the first phase of the study, quantitative data through questionnaire were gathered. The questionnaire was designed under the Wildlife Reserves Regulations (LI 1525) (IUCN/ PACO 2010). KCA was established to serve the basic function of protecting the rainforest ecosystem within the boundary area while promoting the economic development of villages around its periphery (WD 1996). Prior to its establishment , all land covered by KCA was duly acquired by the government from traditional authorities in accordance with the traditional land tenure systems prevalent in 1989 (Agyare 1995 ). Consistent findings have shown that prior to the establishment of KCA, the local people used to harvest products from the area (Agyare 1996, Dei 1996, Abane et al. 1999, Klaus 1999). Klaus (1999), for example, reported that the people of Mosomagor depended on NTFPs such as game, vine, sponge and bamboo collected from the forest. According to Agyare (1996), the traditional authorities released land for the establishment of KCA with the understanding that the infrastructure and economic conditions in the various communities around the park would be improved.","doi":"10.1505/146554812800923381","journal":{"name":"Forestry Review","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":813}

B.","dAbstract":"Introduction Development of responsible tourism, especially in the fragile high-altitude Himalayan region, is fraught with significant challenges. These challenges include operational and infrastructural barriers as well as issues related to adverse impacts on the local environments. However, tourism is also one of the few available alternative pathways that can create new jobs and reduce poverty for the communities in the remote and resource-scarce region of Ladakh. By providing supplementary income to the rural communities, ecotourism can also prevent land abandonment and subsequent rural–urban migration. People in the Ladakh Himalaya led a secluded and subsistence form of life until 1974. Outsiders were not allowed to enter the region before then. The Srinagar– Leh road came into existence in 1960s (Rizvi 1998). Although Ladakh opened to tourism only recently, the sector is rapidly advancing on an unsustainable course. Of the various conservation and development organizations that work in the area, the Snow Leopard Conservancy pioneered the homestay model in Ladakh and demonstrated a need to integrate development and conservation goals (Jackson and Wangchuk 2004). This homestay model is now being adopted by various agencies that are working in the region. With growing global awareness and initiatives to preserve the environment, in tourism, conservation, and rural development sectors, community-based ecotourism is being promoted as a low-impact, environmentally sensitive way to travel (Honey 1999; Kiss 2004; Jones 2005; Nelson 2007). In recognizing the threats posed by unplanned tourism, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-India) felt the need to integrate a communitybased ecotourism project in Korzok that would protect Lake Tsomoriri and offer supplementary incomegenerating opportunities to the Changpa population. Situated at about 4595 m, Korzok (Box 1) is a small picturesque village (Figure 1) on the northwestern shores of Lake Tsomoriri, in the Rukchen Valley of Leh district in Ladakh, India. The lake, situated at 4586 m and 140 km 2 in area, is designated as a wetland of international importance or Ramsar site (Gujja et al 2003). Significant numbers of endemic and migratory species found in the area, including the vulnerable black-necked crane, Grus nigricollis (BirdLife International 2009), are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act of India (1972). Korzok's resources, like the rest of the Changthang plateau, are Mountain Research and Development (MRD) An international, peer-reviewed open access journal published by the International Mountain Society (IMS) www.mrd-journal.org scarce, and the terrain is physically challenging, with a harsh and fragile environment, but it is endowed with unique and beautiful landscapes, unique biodiversity, trekking routes, and cultural assets, which are all major tourist attractions. It has been pointed out that locally based monitoring and enforcement of resources use generates strong ownership and positive conservation outcomes (Chhatre and Agrawal 2008). Given the long tradition of democratic decision-making and common resource use practices among the Changpas, the initiative had to be embedded in the local cultural context in order to generate benefits for the inhabitants and the surrounding environment at the same time. The central development issue in Korzok was to create conditions for an enabling environment that would reconcile the needs of generating alternate livelihood opportunities and high-altitude wetland conservation to support the local economy and reduce poverty through a socially inclusive green tourism project. The main development issue, the evolution of the initiative, and some of the early impacts of the project constitute the focus of the present article.

The results revealed that primary stakeholders have positive attitudes towards forest management and this was not dependent on the location of the community. They support sanctioning people who degrade the forest and accept the need to get a permit before harvesting. However, they are not in favour of strict protection of the reserve. Their attitude towards forest management is influenced by their perception of forest values, concern about degradation of the reserve, economic benefits they derive from the reserve, exposure to resource-use conflicts and membership of conservation organizations. Our findings suggest that primary stakeholders are interested in forest conservation management. But, to achieve sustainable development, it will be necessary to identify the types and quantity of forest products used and their economic significance and to develop initiatives that will support rural livelihoods.","doi":"10.1080/21513732.2011.613411","journal":{"name":"International Journal of Biodiversity Science, Ecosystem Services & Management","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":14}

R. and Batvandi Z. and Karimi H. and Soroushnia R.","dAbstract":"Introduction Protected areas (PAs) are well known to act as sources for food, fuel, clothing, and medicines. Unfortunately, as these resources diminish outside Pas, the pressure on them becomes more intense. For this reason, landscape approaches are required to protect and restore the ecosystem services of PAs. This is especially critical due to the fact that by 2025 over 60% of the world's \" absolute \" poor will live in rural areas, depending directly on the natural resources around them. There are many instances where PAs support local requirements while discouraging commercial interests of outside from rapidly depleting resources. PAs also directly contribute to increased resources-for example-in agriculture, through services such as pollination, or in fisheries through the creation of \" no take \" zones that allow fish stocks to recover. All over the world, PAs are established by governments, nongovernmental organizations and private entities with the aim of conserving biodiversity, and in most cases, without considering how PAs would affect the interested parties and their livelihoods. As a result, today PAs are seen as controversial tools for biodiversity conservation, since according to the mainstream narrative, they have caused the impoverishment of the local population through evictions and denial of access to natural resources. Taking this into account, the linkages between PAs and well-being of people living in or around them has therefore become a practical and ethical necessity. It is a practical necessity, because to survive and achieve their conservation objectives, protected areas need the support of local population and international community. It is an ethical necessity, because as it is widely recognized, conservation objectives cannot be pursued at the expenses of people's well-being. Protected areas such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries are physically shared by ecologically important flora and fauna, tourists , government officials, scientists and communities living in and around them. The benefits of protected areas extend to users at different scales, from local people who depend on particular species for their livelihood, to nations that depend on abundant freshwater and global community that depends on nature's capacity to regulate climate. Worldwide, many countries and regions, rich in biodiversity and poor in economy, have been vigorously promoting ecotourism as a conservation tool in their PAs since 1990s. PAs have played significant roles in tourist attraction in many countries since their establishment. Tourism can be an effective tool in the conservation and management of PAs. It can provide financial and political supports to conservation, and lead to a greater understanding of the value of PAs — which in turn can lead to more areas being protected. There is a wide range of opportunities for ecotourism in PAs. Such opportunities are revenue generation (i.e., user fees, entranced fees and donations), employment opportunities, and justification for protected areas, healthier economy, environmental education, and improved conservation efforts.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Journal of Environmental Studies","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":816}

A Comparison between Villages in Roviana, Solomon Islands","authors":"Aswani S. and Furusawa T.","dAbstract":"Introduction The establishment of community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) is intensifying across Oceania because of the notion that MPAs can conserve biodiversity, sustain ecosystem functions, and enhance the productivity of fisheries in the region. From a biological perspective, fully protected \" no-take \" marine reserves and other marine protected areas are expected to enhance spawning stock biomass and larval dispersal (especially in tropical multi-species fisheries), increase the export of adults to adjacent non-protected areas, maintain biodiversity, preserve representative habitats, and sustain ecosystem functioning (Russ & Alcala, 1999; Bergen & Carr, 2003; Roberts et al., 2003; Hilborn et al., 2004). From a nutrition and health perspective, Pacific Island policy makers are optimistic that MPAs will enhance food security, that is, the long-term ability of households to access marine resources to meet household dietary requirements by subsistence or monetary purchase (Maxwell & Frankenberger, 1992; Allison & Ellis, 2001) and thereby improve the overall health of coastal populations (Lutchman, 2005). However, it is possible that marine protected areas, either temporarily or permanently, restrict the availability of marine resources (Weiant & Aswani, 2006) and thus decrease food security and overall well-being. MPAs as a conservation and fisheries management tool will encounter serious difficulties being sustained in the region if any adverse effects on people's livelihood (subsistence and income) or health are detected, especially given the importance of marine resources for Pacific Islanders. Therefore, it is essential that we study the health and nutritional impacts of MPAs to better appraise their effects on Oceanic peoples. Researchers studying the socioeconomic impacts of MPAs have examined a number of issues, including the effects of MPA-related tourism on local communities (Oracion et al., 2005); conflicts among national, regional, and local constituencies that value marine resources differently (Bunce et al., 1999; Christie, 2004); effects of cultural heterogeneity on the social outcomes of MPAs (Cooke et al., 2000); and how the economic costs and benefits of MPAs are shared among stakeholders unevenly (Pollnac et al., 2001). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Malleret-King, 2000; Gjertsen, 2005), there is a paucity of studies that measure the impact of MPAs on the health and nutritional status of coastal populations. In this article we study how the implementation of MPAs shape people's perceptions of their livelihoods, and we empirically evaluate the possible effects of MPAs on human nutrition and health. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of people's perceptions and nutrition in villages with MPAs of varying success and in a village without an MPA. We also carried out an analysis of nutrition and health by means of food consumption surveys and anthropometric measurements in a village before and after the implementation of an MPA. Specifically, we asked: How did members of villages with MPAs of varying success perceive changes in ocean governance, environmental productivity, and food availability and well-being? And, more significantly, did the MPAs affect human nutritional intake and overall health? We illustrate our case by drawing from our research experience with social and biological monitoring and our experience in establishing marine protected areas in the Western Solomon Islands (Figure 1). We present data from the Kozou, Nusa Hope, Baraulu, Olive, Dunde, and Nusa Banga villages in the Roviana Lagoon (Figure 2).","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":16}

Women glean for shells, crustaceans , echinoderms, and seaweed, and they engage in hand-line fishing, diving, and mass-harvesting techniques. Yet, despite their significant role in the economies of the South Pacific, women are only rarely included in fisheries development and management decisions because governments , industry, and banks hardly recognize the importance of their contributions (Chapman 1987; Matthews 2002). Solomon Island women are frequently disadvantaged by the introduction of fisheries development and conservation schemes, and until recently scant attention has been given to the management of resources that are vitally important for women locally. Because the harvesting of marine invertebrates is mostly carried out by women, the decline in these resources may have the dual effect of altering their position within the household and the community on the one hand and causing a decline in household levels of food security and income on the other. Any attempt to develop long-term sustainable fisheries in the region will require the participation of women, and sustainable development will only be achieved if women and other marginalized groups are socially and economically empowered (Bidesi 1994; Overton and Scheyvens 1999). This will necessitate considerable effort, given that in the Solomon Islands, as elsewhere in the region women's voices continue to go largely unheard with respect to sustainable development , the environment, and the health of their communities (e.g., Griffen 1994). The Roviana Lagoon (seeFigure 2) is protected by a series of raised offshore coral islands that are characterized by rugged, notched limestone with numerous inlets, bays, carbonate-sand beaches, and moats (Stoddart 1969). The inner lagoon encompasses a variety of habitats that include grass beds, mangroves, freshwater swamps, shallow reefs, outer reef-drops, and river estuaries. Roviana women have great knowledge of the fauna with which they interact, including knowledge on the spawning seasonality, feeding habits, and periodicity of many invertebrates. Women glean predominantly in two habitats—estuarine and outer barrier-island intertidal flats. The estuarine bivalves collected include blood cockles (Anadara spp.), mud clams (Polymesoda spp.), oysters (e.g., Crassotrea rhizophorae), Venus shells (Gafrarium tumidum), and mudwhelks (Terebralia palustris). The primary season for collecting these organisms is during the months of May through August (masa rane, day low tide), when diurnal low tides allow women to enter Rhizophora mangrove forests. With the advent of the odu rane (day high tide) tidal season in September, tidal periodicity reverses, and women move into other habitats. The most sought-after invertebrates in the region are the mangrove Anadara granosa, or blood cockle, and the Polymesoda (Geloina) spp., or mud clam, although in Munda and south Vonavona, species that are characteristic of open reef flat, coral rubble, and sand banks are harvested more frequently. Blood cockles and mud clams are vital resources for coastal communities across the Solomon Islands and in other Indo-Pacific island nations (Fay-Sauni and Robinson 1999). In Roviana, the nutritional, economic, and cultural importance of these two species stems from their historic abundance, large size, and accessibility. From a scientific perspective, little is known about the environmental requirements, biology, population status, and tolerances of these bivalve populations in the Solomon Islands. The causes of localized declines in shellfish abundance, for instance, are unknown, and there is little understanding of the effects of overfishing or modification of water quality due to land-based activities.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Human Organization","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":17}

Introduction In recent years tropical forests have received increased political attention for climate change mitigation due to their role in capturing and storing carbon (Bal et al., 2007; Bonan, 2008; Turner et al., 2009 ). Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) refers to local, national and global actions that reduce emissions from forests and which enhance forest carbon stocks in developing countries. The plus sign indicates the enhancement of forest carbon stock as well as forest regeneration and rehabilitation, decreased emissions, increased carbon uptake and carbon removal (Angelsen, 2009). Before the '+' was added, REDD (previously known as Avoided Deforestation) was from an early stage considered to be one of the least expensive ways of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions (Stern, 2006). For many tropical countries, this approach may lead to long-term protection of forest ecosystem goods and services, but there are also high expectations of positive social and livelihood outcomes from REDD+ projects (Karsenty, 2011 ). The anticipated social impacts include improvements in living e n v i r o n m e n t a l s c i e n c e & p o l i c y 3 5 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 7 6 – 8 6 a r t i c l e i n f o The new climate change mitigation scheme for developing countries known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been proposed as a way of reducing carbon emissions in the forest sector, whilst also protecting and improving the livelihoods and wellbeing of communities. This paper argues that it is important to resolve tenure ambiguity and ensure that communities participate in the REDD+ process by engaging them in project development and implementation. Drawing on data collected in six villages under two REDD+ projects targeted in Cameroon, this paper addresses four questions: (1) What are the tenure conditions at the two study sites? (2) How have the project proponents perceived the tenure and other challenges and how do they plan to address those challenges? (3) What have the proponents done to engage communities in the process of establishing REDD+? (4) Are communities informed about and satisfied with the process of establishing REDD+? The paper shows that while the proponents have worked to resolve tenure issues and engage communities, there is still frustration among project participants because of a lack of progress toward implementing compensation and benefit sharing system. The paper concludes that it is crucial to safeguard the rights, access and participation of local communities, and benefits to them, throughout the design and implementation of REDD+ projects. # 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. standards as well as benefits from other environmental services. However, these social objectives could be threatened if certain conditions are not fulfilled in the design or implementation of REDD+ projects. This includes land tenure reform, which is perceived as a precondition for payment and community member participation in REDD+ projects (Karsenty, 2011 ), benefit-sharing arrangements, equity and decentralization in forest resource management, leading to more responsibility for rural dwellers. An analysis of African state laws for compatibility with international treaties and declarations (such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Convention on Biological Diversity, ILO Convention 169, and Universal Declaration of Human Rights) reveals an absence of recognition of customary institutions and customary rights to land, resources, and forests in sub-Saharan Africa. Local communities are often marginalized in policy making processes, lacking official recognition of property rights to land. The problem is similar in other parts of the world. Agrawal et al. (2008) report that 75–85% of the world's tropical forests are still under formal government ownership , though rights to trees are sometimes considered separately from state claims to land. The problem remains important on a global scale. Specific concerns for Africa include governance issues and a weak civil society. However , progress has been reported in some countries like Tanzania where local communities and indigenous people have rarely enjoyed official control over land and forest resources (Lawlor et al., 2010). Commentators have recognized that tenure is problematic in the forestry landscape and needs to be addressed before local REDD+ schemes are implemented. Indigenous peoples and local communities, supported by international organizations like the Forest Peoples Programme in the UK and the United Nations REDD programme (UNREDD), perceive tenure reform as a key governance challenge. Challenging conditions resulting from state ownership of forests may lead to forest tenure insecurity that disregards customary claims, creating uncertainties in terms of the fulfillment of REDD+ project objectives (Larson et al., 2010a,b,c). Significantly, respondents in governments have expressed optimism about the potential role REDD+ has to play in tenure reform. The issue of forest access and tenure has been raised by international groups such as the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and the World Resource Institute (WRI), working with forest-dependent communities (Cotula and Mayers, 2009; Eliasch, 2008; Stern, 2006). Concerns have been raised that efforts to establish strong local tenure will be diverted by programmes that channel substantial resources into technocratic and short term approaches to REDD+ (Cotula and Mayers, 2009). Other observers stress that any tenure reform needs to be consistent with customary practices. In Congo Basin countries, this may mean recognizing different forms of communal ownership rather than individual private ownership (Jindal et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2011) bearing in mind that the ownership should include both the ability to manage (use) and to exclude (Schlager and Ostrom, 1992). The rights of forest-dependent people are yet to be adequately recognized in forest resource and land management. In Cameroon, the allocation of permits granted for non-timber forest products (NTFP) on a yearly basis by an inter-ministerial committee discriminates against rural dwellers lacking resources, favoring operators with easier access to permits and official quotas for marketing forest products, often pushing the poor into illegality (Ndoye and Awono, 2009). Although there is no conclusive proof that more secure tenure rights lead to an increase in benefits from forest resources, commentators recognize the importance of resolving tenure ambiguity and assuring community participation in REDD+ (Westholm et al., 2011). Communities need to be part of the solution if REDD+ project implementation is to be successful as there is a risk that REDD+ schemes result in government, companies, conservation NGOs or speculators carving up forest lands and pursuing forest protection approaches that marginalize forest people (Griffiths, 2007). For this reason, the UNREDD programme stresses the importance of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as an operational guideline for the engagement of indigenous people and other dependent communities in the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (United Nations, 2007, Art. 41). This view is in line with observations by Ostrom (2010), who made the point that policies should focus on how to ensure the participation of local users in developing forest management plans. An absence of local communities' participation in such a complex process may compromise the possibility of REDD+ offering livelihood opportunities to forest communities (Cotula and Mayers, 2009). This article examines the issues of tenure rights and participation in the context of REDD+ in two REDD project sites in Cameroon: the Payment for Environmental Services (PES) project led by Centre pour l'Environnement et le Dé veloppement (CED) and the Mount Cameroon REDD+ project managed by GFA Envest under the Programme for Sustainable Management of Natural Resources of the Southwest (PSMNR-SW) region. Both aim at reducing forest loss and increasing forest carbon stocks and eventually at financial compensation for the achievement of these aims. We analyze the tenure preconditions and participation, and how they can be addressed in fulfillment of the project goals. The paper poses four questions: (1) What are the tenure conditions at the two study sites? (2) How have the project proponents perceived the tenure and other challenges and how do they plan to address those challenges? (3) What have the proponents done to engage communities in the process of establishing REDD+? (4) Are communities informed about and satisfied with the process of establishing REDD+? The paper comprises four sections. The following section presents a theoretical foundation for analyzing tenure and participation. The method section elaborates on the methods used in addressing the research questions. The questions posed are subsequently answered in the results section. The implications of the findings are examined in a wider context in the discussion section. A concluding section summarizes the paper and discusses policy implications.","doi":"10.1016/j.envsci.2013.01.017","journal":null,"aid":820}

Introduction Incomes from environmental sources play an important role in rural livelihoods in developing countries. In particular, products from forest environmental sources contribute significantly to rural households' economic wellbeing (Reardon and Vosti, 1995; Reddy and Chakravarty, 1999; Cavendish, 1999 Cavendish, , 2000 Vedeld et al., 2004; Fisher, 2004; Getachew Mamo et al., 2007). Most rural household surveys, however, only capture conventional rural activities, such as crop production and livestock rearing, and rarely incorporate incomes from environmental resources. The goods and services provided by environmental resources, such as forest environmental products 1 , are often omitted. This is because forests or grasslands tend to be either communally owned or, if privately owned, not expressly cultivated. As a result, there is a substantial gap in our understanding of the actual economic contribution of environmental resources, the functioning of rural economies and the extent of rural poverty and inequality. Recently there is a growing awareness of the importance and value of the use of natural resources in the lives of rural communities (Campbell and Luckert, 2002; Cavendish, 2000; Vedeld et al., 2004; Reardon and Vosti, 1995; Fisher, 2004). For instance, Cavendish (1999) estimated that 35% of the total income of rural households in communal areas of Zimbabwe originates from environmental pro- ducts. Fisher (2004) showed that 30% of household income in rural Malawi is accounted for by forest income. In the Dendi district of south western Ethiopia, Getachew Mamo et al. (2007) have found that forest income contributes 39% to average household income. Godoy et al. (2002) have estimated that, on average, 17–45% of household earnings across four Amerindian villages in the Bolivian lowlands and eastern Honduras is generated from forest activities. In the agrarian economy of Ethiopia, the economic contribution of trees and forests is significant but not well documented. Due to a lack of data and methodological problems in environmental valuation, the existing figures on forest value estimates understate the total contribution of the forestry sector to the country's economy. These figures even do not fully reflect the 'formal' economic contribution of forests, let alone the 'informal' ones. 2 In the period 1982–1992, for instance, Forest Policy and Economics 11 (2009) 109–117 ⁎ Corresponding author.

Door to door surveys were carried out, and using ®xed response questionnaires people were interviewed to examine their views towards conservation and proposed alternatives to the forest resources for reducing biomass demand from the forest. The study revealed that in the area the concept of conservation of forests is well supported. Nevertheless, people are extracting biomass from the corridor forest for their sustenance. The dependence of the people on the forest is due to lack of alternatives to the forest resources, inability of the people to produce alternatives from market, and in some cases it is Ôhabitual' or Ôtraditional'. In a situation where forest resources will not be available, people without any alternatives to forest resources are ready to agitate against such rules. People who oppose such decisions are not always dependent on the corridor forest but are antagonistic towards the forest department and want to use this opportunity to retaliate by stealing from the forest. The former category of people are the ones for whom income generating activities would be important while the later category should be the targets of extension programs designed to establish permanent lines of dialogue with the forest department. To some extent human-animal con¯ict and apathetic attitude of the forest department are also responsible for antagonism of people.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":824}

D. and Leslie P. W.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction The proliferation of parks and protected areas (PAs) around the world has spurred extensive research and a general consensus that the fates of local livelihoods and local environmental protection are linked (Adams et al., 2004; Cernea and Schmidt-Soltau, 2006; West et al., 2006; Wilkie et al., 2006; Agrawal and Redford, 2006; Barrett et al., 2011). Despite this consensus and a wealth of research on the social costs associated with biodiversity conservation (West et al., 2006; Coad et al., 2008), much remains unknown about how PAs create constraints and opportunities for people, and how people adapt to these effects creating new conservation and development concerns in the process (Miller et al., 2012). Some recent studies have found measures of poverty reduction on the borders of parks and PAs (Andam et al., 2010; Sims, 2010; Naughton-Treves et al., 2011; Barrett et al., 2011). These findings run contrary to much of the literature on the social dynamics of conservation, which have focused on the social burdens created by PAs (West et al., 2006; Brosius et al., 2005; Brockington et al., 2008). Recent studies showing poverty reduction near PAs, however, lack convincing theories of change and have struggled to describe the mechanisms that underlie these phenomena. Andam et al. (2010) noted that ''research to understand these mechanisms is a clear future priority''. This paper examines the mechanisms that underlie changes in wealth and income measures among agro-pastoralist households living near Tarangire National Park (TNP) in northern Tanzania. Here, parks and PAs are conceptualized as centers of disturbance and upheaval, to which households respond in ways to spread risk, reduce variance in household income and wealth, and improve welfare. Following this approach, our paper examines the character and incidence of livelihood diversification in agropastoral communities near TNP compared to control communities.","doi":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.05.002","journal":null,"aid":827}

E. and Leader-Williams N.","dAbstract":"Conflicts between protected-area managers and local people are common, but the drivers of conflict are rarely analyzed. This limits opportunities to identify strategies that reduce conflict and the magnitude of resulting threats to conservation. Integrated conservation and development (ICD) was adopted at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, to reduce conflict during gazettement of the national park, but the success of this approach remains contested. We retrieved documents of conflict written by park staff and local people from 1986 through 2000 (before, during, and after gazettement). We extracted data on 48 incidences of violent conflict and categorized them by gazettement period, area, instigator, and type to undertake a historical analysis of the triggers of violent conflict at Bwindi. Before and during gazettement, local villagers instigated most of the conflict incidents when law-enforcement efforts sought to halt commercial activities within Bwindi. No conflict arose from the arrest of villagers collecting subsistence resources during these periods. After gazettement, prohibitions on commercial activities continued to drive conflict even though villagers collecting subsistence resources were arrested more frequently than before gazettement, and local attitudes toward the park had improved following receipt of ICD benefits. Law-enforcement efforts targeted commercial activities to reduce this threat to Bwindi's mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), although the activities remained important income sources for people in villages near Bwindi. Losing commercial income following gazettement therefore appeared to be their primary motivation for instigating conflict with park rangers. Prohibitions on subsistence resource use triggered conflict less often. Our use of typologies for a multivariate conflict analysis demonstrates that by identifying differences between effects of conservation as drivers of conflict, conflict analysis can enable a more strategic deployment of conflict–resolution measures that could further conservation efforts. At Bwindi targeting ICD toward individuals who lost benefits from commercial activities may strengthen the role of ICD in conflict resolution and conservation. Decreto de Parques y Conservación y Desarrollo Integrados como Factores de Conflictos entre Comunidades en el Bosque Impenetrable Bwindi, Uganda Resumen: Los conflictos entre administradores dé areas protegidas y habitantes locales son comunes, pero los factores que los ocasionan son analizados raramente. Esto limita las oportunidades para identificar estrategias que reduzcan el conflicto y la magnitud de las amenazas a la conservación resultantes. La conser-vación y desarrollo integrados (CDI) fue adoptada en el Bosque Impenetrable Bwindi, Uganda, para reducir conflictos por el decreto de parque nacional, pero eí exito de este método ha sido impugnado. Recopilamos ‡Current address: Chris Britton Baker et al. 161 documentos del conflicto escritos por personal del parque y por habitantes locales entre 1986 y 2000 (antes, durante y después del decreto). Extrajimos datos de 48 incidentes de conflicto violento y los clasificamos por período, ´ area, instigador y tipo para realizar un análisis histórico de los detonadores de conflictos violentos en Bwindi. Antes y durante el decreto, los habitantes locales instigaron la mayoría de los conflictos violentos cuando esfuerzos por hacer que se cumpliera la ley buscaban detener actividades comerciales en Bwindi. Durante esos períodos ningún conflicto se originó por el arresto de habitantes que recolectaban recursos de subsistencia. Después del decreto, la prohibición de actividades comerciales siguió detonando conflictos aun cuando habitantes recolectores de recursos de subsistencia fueron arrestados más frecuentemente que antes del decreto, y las actitudes locales hacia el parque habían mejorado después de recibir los beneficios de CDI. Los esfuerzos para hacer que se cumpliera la ley fueron enfocados en las actividades comerciales para reducir esta amenaza para los gorilas (Gorilla beringei beringei) de Bwindi, aunque las actividades seguían siendo una fuente de ingreso importante para los habitantes de poblados cercanos a Bwindi. Por lo tanto, la pérdida de ingresos comerciales después del decreto aparentemente fue la motivación primaria para la instigación de conflictos con personal del parque. La prohibición del uso de recursos de subsistencia fue un detonador de conflictos menos frecuente. Nuestro uso de tipologías para el análisis multivariado de conflictos demuestra que mediante la identificación de diferencias entre efectos de la conservación como detonadores de conflictos, el análisis de conflictos puede facilitar un despliegue más estratégico de medidas de resolución de conflictos que pudieran promover esfuerzos de conservación. En Bwindi, enfocar la CDI hacia individuos que perdieron beneficios de las actividades comerciales puede reforzar el papel de la CDI en la resolución de conflictos y la conservación.

To address the hypothesis that conservation attitudes should improve around protected areas (PAs) with more social and economic interventions, stratified random questionnaire surveys of 234 households were conducted in two PAs in the Western Terai of Nepal: Bardia National Park (BNP), in which interventions have been more widespread for longer time periods, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (SWR), in which interventions are relatively recent. Both are part of a major landscape-level conservation programme under implementation in Nepal, and both are under threat of political turmoil, uncontrolled immigration, inefficient land reform policies and unsustainable resource use. There was spatio-temporal variability in resource use patterns and dependence. People collected eight and seven types of resources in BNP and SWR, respectively, and people in BNP were more dependent on resources overall. About 72% of respondents mentioned the problem of inadequate firewood, and suggested the promotion of alternative energy and permission to collect from PAs as mitigating strategies. Of 11 attitude statements, five significantly differed between the two areas. Respondents from the BNP had more favourable attitudes about conservation than those from SWR, supporting the main hypothesis. Training received by respondents, damage by wildlife, dependence on resources and satisfaction towards user groups contributed significantly to the variation in conservation attitudes. The results suggest that the liberalization of PA management has enabled the use of resources, improved livelihoods to some extent and solicited more favourable conservation attitudes in Nepal.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892907003670","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":21}

We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 66 executive members of 10 CAMCs and 67 members of 9 CFUCs. While both models appear to have performed well overall, the CA under the direction of the NGO appears to have fared better with regard to (i) developing trust of local constituencies, (ii) garnering favorable attitudes among villagers, (iii) building capacity of executive members , and (iv) improving standards of living.

Human capital is ''the knowledge, skills, competencies and attributes embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of personal, social and economic well-being'' (OECD 2001, 18). Social capital refers to the stocks of social networks, associations, norms, and trust that enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives or use them for productive purposes (Coleman 1988; Putnam 1995; Grootaert et al. 2004). Pretty and Ward (2001) identify four central aspects of social capital: (i) relations of trust; (ii) reciprocity and exchanges; (iii) common rules, norms, and sanctions; and (iv) connectedness in networks and groups. Natural capital is the aggregation of all environmental assets that provide inputs for production, ecological services, and waste assimilation services (Costanza 2003). Natural capital is the only form of capital that builds ecological resilience directly through the provision of ecosystem services and mechanisms to absorb shocks and stresses (Pearce et al. 1989). As such, its critical functions cannot be supplanted by other forms of capital. The conventional concept of sustainability boils down to the maintenance of capital stocks. Sustainability can be defined as the continued transformation of flows from the capital stocks, without their depletion, into outputs (Brunckhorst 2001). The levels of and changes in the stocks of various capitals can influence the resilience and adaptability of social-ecological systems. In this context, resilience has been defined as the amount of change a system can absorb while maintaining its same structures and functions, the system's ability to self-organize, and the degree to which the system is capable of learning and adapting (Carpenter et al. 2001). More succinctly, resilience is a system's capacity to deal with change and continue to develop (Folke and Gunderson 2006). Although both the concepts of sustainability and resilience appear to be similar, there are some nuances that differentiate them. Conventional sustainability involves the maintenance of some ''ideal'' static state, while resilience preserves the dynamic ability of systems to manage changes. In sustainability , the emphasis is on the steady state of capital stocks. Meanwhile, in resilience the emphasis is on monitoring changes in the stocks of capital that influence the system's capacity to endure disturbances. Multiple theorists draw a distinction between the key factors affecting institutional systems as ''fast'' and ''slow'' variables (Light et al. 1995; Carpenter et al. 2001; Yorque et al. 2002). Fast variables can change quickly, with time domains on the order of years or in some cases even months, whereas slow variables may turn over on the order of decades (Light et al. 1995). Financial and physical capitals are considered fast variables. Human, social, and natural capitals, on the other hand, are slow variables. It typically takes many years, even decades, for rules, norms, values, and landscapes to change. Human skills and experience develop over similarly long periods of time. It has been argued that the resilience of social–ecological systems is controlled primarily by slow changing variables (Carpenter et al. 2001). This research explores the relative relationships of these different forms of capitals to the resilience of community-based conservation organizations. Some researchers have used the capitals framework to assess the resilience or sustainability of social-ecological systems (Cocklin and Alston 2003; Abel et al. 2006; Garnett et al. 2007). Others have explored relationships between a particular form of capital and system resilience. Diamond (2005) argues that societies that have persisted over time have taken society-wide measures to protect the stock of capitals, especially natural capital. The connection between social capital, human capital, and resilience in social–ecological systems has also been a recent focal point of investigation for a number of researchers (Folke et al. 2005; Munasinghe 2007). Munasinghe (2007) emphasizes the role of social capital for building community resilience. He argues that social capital embedded within traditional communities made them resilient to the 2004 Asian tsunami in Sri Lanka. Folke et al. (2005) argue that human capital is critical for understanding disturbances and enhancing the adaptive capacity of complex systems. There is a relative dearth of empirical research in which all the five forms of capital and resilience are studied together. Because these theoretical frameworks (capital stocks and resilience) are critical to understanding complex social–ecological systems, we have undertaken empirical research to explore the relationships between the five forms of capital and the resilience of grassroots conservation committees to the Maoist insurgency in Nepal.","doi":"10.1080/08941920.2010.495372","journal":null,"aid":23}

This crisis in fisheries calls for a resource management through community-based initiatives (World Bank et aZ., 1991; McGoodwin, 1992; Pomeroy and Williams, 1994; Sajise, 1995 ). Failure of government to effectively mediate gear conflicts and police open-access maritime ecosystems has polarized competing users and has further worsened resource degradation (Feeny et aL, 1990; Ghee and Valencia, 1990; Alcala, 1998). Co-management, where resource users and the government share responsibility in the management of fishery resources, and community-based initiatives could reduce conflicts and slow down the degradation of these resources (Jentoft, 1989; Pomeroy and Williams, 1994; Sunderlin and Gorospe, 1997). Co-management recognizes the importance of involving user groups in the development and implementation of management policies. The concept is drawn from a common property theory which postulates that a shared resource can be protected by instituting property rights (Acheson, 1989; Feeny et aZ., 1990; Lim et al, 1995).

It has no transition zone and interactions with the surrounding human population are complex. A recently adopted management plan allows experiments with limited consumptive use of natural resources, in exchange for people's collaboration. In order to determine which resources are desired and which resources are liabilities, people in the Park's vicinity were interviewed. Respondents' attitudes towards conservation were positive, motivated by both use and intrinsic values, and with reference to future generations. Attitudes were significantly related to locally perceived benefits. Respondents found most of the Park's resources useful but differences between user groups were significant. User groups also differed in their complaints about human-wildlife conflicts, but overall they considered the animals most important for tourism as the main nuisance. This case study shows that local aspirations cannot all be met, but indicates that limited outreach can improve existing public support for conservation measures.","doi":"10.1017/S037689290300016X","journal":null,"aid":29}

These ecotones are critical for conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest-agriculture ecotones? (2) How can forest-agriculture ecotones contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture ecotones? We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, in the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE's interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest-agriculture ecotones. Simultaneously, ATREE's interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that play a critical role in the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive, strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture ecotones by the governmental agencies and international organizations. We argue that forest-agriculture ecotones offer a means to conserve biodiversity through alleviation of poverty and development of community-based institutions. #","doi":"10.1016/j.agee.2006.12.023","journal":null,"aid":30}

However, evidence worldwide has shown mixed results. A financial, economic and environmental cost-benefit analysis of two community forests in Cameroon revealed that community forests are economically and environmentally profitable , and benefit communities more, compared to a baseline situation. Sharp differences between the economic and financial returns highlight the importance of conditional factors. These include the communities' technical and managerial skills, access to finance, legal resources and market information, and the communities' capacity for vertical integration. The cases highlight the limitations of the current regulatory and policy framework as a determining influence on the exploitation of community forests and conclude there is a pressing need for institutional and organizational reforms within the governmental and support apparatus to increase the profitability and equity of community forestry.

This paper investigates how common property institutional arrangements contribute to sustainable mangrove fisheries in coastal Ecuador, focusing on the fishery for the mangrove cockle (Anadara tuberculosa and A. similis), a bivalve mollusk harvested from the roots of mangrove trees and of particular social, economic, and cultural importance for the communities that depend on it. Specifically, this study examines the emergence of new civil society institutions within the historical context of extensive mangrove deforestation for the expansion of shrimp farming, policy changes in the late 1990s that recognized \" ancestral \" rights of local communities to mangrove resources, and how custodias, community-managed mangrove concessions, affect the cockle fishery. Findings from interviews with shell collectors and analysis of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indicate that mangrove concessions as common property regimes promote community empowerment, local autonomy over resources, mangrove conservation and recovery, higher cockle catch shares, and larger shell sizes, but the benefits are not evenly distributed. Associations without custodias and independent cockle collectors feel further marginalized by the loss of gathering grounds, potentially deflecting problems of overexploitation to \" open-access \" areas, in which mangrove fisheries are weakly managed by the State.

M.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction Over the last several decades, a large percentage of coastal mangrove wetland forests in Ecuador have been cleared for the development of shrimp aquaculture despite the existence of forestry laws protecting mangroves since the 1980s. The current Ecuadorian Forestry Law stipulates that mangroves are public goods of the State, \"not subject to possession or any other kind of appropriation, and can only be exploited by way of authorized concession.\" 2 Since 1985, the cutting, burning, and exploitation of mangroves has been prohibited (Bravo 2007: 27). These policies were weakly upheld in light of export-led growth and global demand for cheap shrimp cocktail that drove the conversion of public mangrove areas into private shrimp farms throughout Ecuador and many other parts of the developing world, resulting in widespread environmental degradation, welfare impacts, and social conflict (Bailey 1988; Stonich 1995; DeWalt, Vergne, and Hardin 1996; Primavera 1997; Cruz-Torres 2000; Stonich and Vandergeest 2001; Gunawardena and Rowan 2005; Lutz 2006) and what Martinez-Alier (2001) has called a \"tragedy of enclosures.\" However, in 1999, White Spot Syndrome Virus, a disease in cultured shrimp, halted the further expansion of shrimp ponds into vital mangrove habitat. By the year 2000, the Ecuadorian State began to recognize the \"ancestral\" rights of \"traditional user groups\" to mangrove resources, paving the way for custodias, ten-year community-managed concessions. As of July 2011, a total of 37,818 hectares have been granted to 41 different communities as part of the national strategy toward community-based conservation and management of mangrove resources (Rosero Moya and Santillan Salas 2011). After decades of struggle and conflict between shrimp farmers and artisanal fishers who have lost their fishing grounds to aquaculture, fishing communities in Ecuador now have the legal backing to defend their livelihoods, guard their mangroves against further destruction, and promote sustainable mangrove fisheries. This article will demonstrate, however, that the establishment of custodias has changed the nature of the struggle over mangrove resources from artisanal fishers versus shrimp farmers to a struggle between compañeros, those who have custodias and those who do not. Given recent concerns about overexploitation in recent decades and its likely relationship to shrimp farming (Ocampo-Thomason 2006; C-CONDEM 2007), I focus on the fishery for the mangrove cockle (Anadara tuberculosa and A. similis), a bivalve mollusk harvested from the roots of mangrove trees by artisanal fishers. The general aim of this study is to bridge theoretical perspectives from political ecology and commons theory to evaluate shifting policies and the implications for social relations among mangrove fishers in Ecuador. While the establishment of common property arrangements under government-granted custodias appears to promote sustainable cockle collecting, the very custodias designed to empower local communities in defense against mangrove destruction may now serve as a new form of enclosure that denies access to independent cockle collectors not affiliated with any local association and further threatens to undermine the ecological sustainability of the fishery (Beitl 2011). As also pointed out by O'Flaherty (2003), it is important to not only consider the relationships between local communities and their local ecologies as discrete areas governed by a set of property relations, but also the larger socio-ecological and historical context in which those property regimes are embedded. Furthermore, property relations only represent one _________________________________________________________________________ 1 Ph.D. candidate, Department of Anthropology, University of Georgia, USA.

The results shows that community forest utilization offers opportunities for forest sustainability. However, findings on gender involvement reveal that the women are continuously dominated, with only three women out of 20 representatives on the village forest committee and making decisions (women make up only 16% of the village forest committees). Women are also not well represented in forest conservation initiatives despite the fact that they are the source of food security for their households. This paper argues that the lack of knowledge exchange and women's continued exclusion from forest management are critical issues that could undermine the future of the world's forests.

J. and Dearden P.","dAbstract":"Conservation success is often predicated on local support for conservation which is strongly influenced by perceptions of the impacts that are experienced by local communities and opinions of management and governance. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are effective conservation and fisheries management tools that can also have a broad array of positive and negative social, economic, cultural, and political impacts on local communities. Drawing on results from a mixed-methods study of communities on the Andaman Coast of Thailand, this paper explores perceptions of MPA impacts on community livelihood resources (assets) and outcomes as well as MPA governance and management. The area includes 17 National Marine Parks (NMPs) that are situated near rural communities that are highly dependent on coastal resources. Interview participants perceived NMPs to have limited to negative impacts on fisheries and agricultural livelihoods and negligible benefits for tourism livelihoods. Perceived impacts on livelihoods were felt to result from NMPs undermining access to or lacking support for development of cultural, social, political, financial, natural, human, physical, and political capital assets. Conflicting views emerged on whether NMPs resulted in negative or positive marine or terrestrial conservation outcomes. Perceptions of NMP governance and management processes were generally negative. These results point to some necessary policy improvements and actions to ameliorate: the relationship between the NMP and communities, NMP management and governance processes, and socioeconomic and conservation outcomes.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2013.08.017","journal":null,"aid":39}

F.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION In last five decades since independence, India has shown remarkable progress in key development areas, but a large number of people still depend on forest resources for livelihood and income generation. Of these an estimated 140 million are forest dwellers who are primarily dependent on forests not only for meeting their multiple household needs but also for their food security. A special category of these forest dwellers is the aboriginal population of tribals who are distributed all over the country. Of the nearly 68 million tribal population, 50% directly depend on forest for their livelihood requirements like food, fodder, medicinal plants, small timber and a variety of other Nontimber Forest Products (NTFPs) which they collect from the wild. These tribals are amongst the most marginal section of the population, mostly in a state of extreme deprivation with very low development index with regard to health, nutrition, and education. In this backdrop, the role of the forest in developing an overall development strategy especially for the tribals assumes great importance. In addition to the problem of poverty is the widespread concern over the declining state of the natural resource base, forest being a key component. India's forest cover of 65 million ha is under intense pressure from the growing population (both human and livestock), forest fire and growing commercial needs of forest products for the expanding economy. Many State sponsored afforestation programmes were undertaken in the 1980s with varied results though they have certainly checked the rate of deforestation. In past decade there has been a great emphasis on community oriented forest management through Joint forest Management (JFM) in which participation of forest dependent population was envisaged in management and protection of forest (Bhattacharya 1997; Khare et al. 2000; Sarin 1995; Prasad and Bhattacharya 2000; Malhotra and Poffenberger 1989) Estimates indicate that NTFPs contribute 10–40% of income of 50 million tribal household in India, while a further 200–300 million villagers depend on NTFPs to a lesser degree (Shiva 1993). In the dry tropical Forest areas of India, where there is scarcity of water and opportunities for farming are limited, NTFPs are in many cases the only means for survival to tribals. Such forest areas also offer challenges of rapid degradation and poor regeneration status. The case study in such settings as described in the paper gives a detailed analysis of participatory NTFPbased rural development strategy. The key areas of concern in the present case have been, yield estimation of extractive reserve, devising sustainable harvesting regimes, ensuring optimum benefits to the collectors, the active collaboration of all key stake-holders and institutional development.","doi":"10.1505/ifor.6.2.161.38399","journal":{"name":"Review","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":41}

The JFM program, evolved during early 1970s covering a few forest villages as a model for reversing the trend of degraded forest ecosystem through the active protection by local villagers. The JFM program is implemented currently by 106,482 Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMC) and it covers 22 million ha of forests spread across 28 constituent states of India and union territories. JFM emerged against a backdrop of two centuries of centralised bureaucratic control over forest management in India. Centralized control during the 19th and 20th centuries failed either to conserve resources or to contribute substantially to the well-being of local populations. However, inconsistent persuasions from decentralization policies in India under present forest policy (1988) have prompted people to analyse the theoretical basis for accepting that decentralization would bring improvements in forest ecosystem management. Still others have contested the de facto rationale for decentralization (i.e., improved forest management) and have suggested that decentralization may be a manipulation by elites to serve their own interests or to shift power, for example from national to international agencies that have funded decentralization. Thirty years from its inception, there are now concerns for the recent effectiveness of JFM (over the past 20 years) because it is a group action that is getting old and is perhaps losing some of its pioneering drive and innovativeness. Although JFM has been administered nationally, decisions on implementation detail have been left to the individual states, resulting in different strategies. The long history of JFM has also provided scope for experiences with it to change over time as well as between places. Given the range of experiences with and perceptions of JFM, as well as the importance of the objectives JFM ostensibly serves, the time is ripe therefore for a retrospective evaluation to take stock of its actual achievements, its status and ways forward. The current paper seeks to provide such a review and analysis. The paper highlights design and implementation issues related to government resolutions, benefits-sharing and forest offences. It also assesses the critical design factors and key drivers responsible for institutional reforms. The paper evaluates impacts of protection on forest productivity and on the livelihoods of local communities. It highlights that the JFM program, by virtue of the diversity of its implementation , provides an ideal laboratory for exploring why similar reforms can lead to different outcomes. The paper argued that though there are supporting government policy and guideline and massive fund support, why there has been a low down of enthusiasm for JFM in the last two decades. From experiences, it suggests strategies for its revival and JFM can further contribute effective toward forest conservation and enhanced livelihood opportunities in the future.","doi":"10.1016/j.resconrec.2009.10.003","journal":null,"aid":42}

In many lower and middle-income countries, including South Africa, avitourism is being applied in an effort to simultaneously achieve community development and biodiversity conservation. This paper presents the results of an exploratory investigation of 11 community-based avitourism projects in South Africa. Conservation benefi ts were measured with the Threat Reduction Assessment tool. We calculated the Gamma (G) correlation coeffi cient to explore the relationship between conservation and income benefi ts and project characteristics. The projects were successful at reducing threats to sites where conservation was an explicit objective (n=11, G=0.609, P=0.03). The level of income benefi ts did not correlate with success in reducing threats to conservation. Once involved in avitourism projects, the average monthly income earned by local bird guides increased from USD 114 to USD 362. The extent of income benefi ts was positively related to the extent of support to projects (n=10, G=0.714, P=0.01). Participants in the projects reported substantive capacity building and empowerment benefi ts. Success in delivering conservation, income and empowerment benefi ts was challenged by the local guide's limited previous exposure to tourism and business, the guide's lack of self assurance, cultural differences, and a requirement for sustained mentorship and support to overcome these barriers. We conclude that with adequate long-term support, avitourism projects can be a cost-effective way to create jobs and deliver conservation and human development benefi ts.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.79198","journal":null,"aid":43}

In 1989, the Ugandan government formerly recognised that wetlands need to be conserved and contribute considerably to the National economy and rural livelihood. The present analysis is focused on the Nabugabo wetland ecosystem. Located in Central Uganda, it is an important part of the extensive system of wetlands that surround Lake Victoria. The Nabugabo wetland is a source of important resources that are basic to the local economy, including fishing, water utilization, agriculture , livestock, wetland plants for construction and more recently, tourism. Investment in the area is low and a large percentage of the local community depends on the wetland resources for basic sustenance needs. After achieving Ramsar status, demarcation and conservation activities were initiated by the local and national leaders. However, these conservation efforts have provoked conflicts between the land owners and the policy makers, in particular to the demarcation of areas for conservation In the present analysis, we examine the benefits, perceived by local leaders and community members, of the wetland and its services, as well as views towards its conservation and management. The results show that differences between the community leaders and member exist regarding the perceived benefits of the wetlands. Tourism, while providing some opportunities for local persons is not always viewed positively. Conservation activities are viewed positively but some questions remain as to whether such efforts help or hinder the local population, in particular regarding access to basic resources.","doi":"10.1007/s11273-007-9049-3","journal":null,"aid":44}

A. and W E B B D. L. and Webb E. L.","dAbstract":"Non–timber forest product (NTFP) use is an integral part of the rural economy of Nepal, but little is known about NTFP collection and marketing dynamics. This study investigated the intensity of NTFP collection, the financial benefits gained through the collection of a representative species, and the contextual factors influencing NTFP collection and sale in 12 villages of the Baitadi district of far western Nepal. Thirty-nine per cent of the economically active population collected a total of 24 NTFPs from 23 species, which contributed 0–90% of the total household income. A marketing chain and financial analysis of Valeriana jatamansi (sugandhwal) revealed that various trading and marketing channels existed from the village to district-level NTFP outlets. The price received by the collector depended on the length of the market chain and the political context of the market. Political instability resulting from the Maoist insurgency reduced profits from sugandhwal sale by 23–25%. The number of NTFP-selling outlets accessed by collectors was the most important variable determining the number of NTFPs collected and the overall contribution of NTFPs to the household. Physical accessibility of the village did not impact the contribution of NTFPs to the household livelihood. The strength of NTFP-related institutions (both government and non-governmental organizations) decreased the total NTFP contribution to livelihoods because at the time of the study the villages were in transition to domestication of NTFPs. In the future, the contribution of domesticated NTFPs to households in villages with strong NTFP-related institutions should be much greater than at present. Increasing access to NTFP-selling outlets may be achieved through information dissemination, empowerment of collectors and establishment of linkages between collectors and traders.

In this paper, we apply participatory scenario processes to address the development of multifunctional forestry in these mountains by taking as an example the case study of Slovensky Raj National Park and specifically focusing on the involvement of local communities, particularly the Roma minority, in sustainable forest management (SFM). The paper argues that development of local institutions and promotion of horizontal and vertical participation to increase social capital is necessary for addressing social and economic problems, managing potential conflicts and sustaining multifunctional forestry development. The results suggest that the way forward is the integration of multipurpose forest management with community development, and that learning, repeated stakeholder interaction, trust-building and cooperation between and within multiethnic local communities are important preconditions for success. The scenario process applied turned out to be beneficial for both the majority and the minority populations, particularly allowing for discussions about future development of mountain regions, their local economies and communities, and for providing some guidance about what are the preferred actions for participation in multifunctional SFM.","doi":"10.1007/s11842-011-9185-8","journal":{"name":"Small-scale Forestry","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":46}

In this paper, we present an analysis of the prospects of a community-based plantation using taungya systems and indigenous trees as means to forest rehabilitation and livelihood improvement in Ghana. The project management strategies, communication process and incentive mechanism and their impact on local participation are discussed with the aim to recommending a mechanism through which local farmers can best be involved in rehabilitation of degraded sites in the future in Ghana. Data were collected through a survey using personal interviews of 431 farming households and ten key informants from ten communities living in scattered hamlets in and around forests reserves. The results show a high rate of local participation in project tree planting activities. Four years after the project's initiation, about 250 ha of plantations had been established using twelve priority indigenous and one exotic species and farmers had indicated improvement in their farming practices and availability of food and forest products. Restoring forest quality as a timber resource and associated values, getting money, food stuff and timber and non-timber for domestic use, and having access to fertile land for farming were the top three issues prioritised by respondents as motivational factors for engaging in the project activities. Overall, this project demonstrates that reversing tropical forest degradation is possible.

{"filename":"Bose 2011","year":2011,"title":"Forest Tenure Reform: Exclusion of Tribal Women's Rights in Semi-Arid Rajasthan, India","authors":"Bose P.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION In recent years, the substantial shift towards decentralized forest tenure reform (Capistrano and Colfer 2005, Ribot et al. 2006) has led to the recognition of the rights of, and/or legal transfer of forests to, indigenous peoples in the global South (Colchester 2004, Sunderlin et al. 2008). Forestland tenure security for forest-dependent indigenous people is believed to hold potential for good governance, improved livelihoods, and better forest management and conservation (White and Martin 2002). Larson et al. (2010: 37 -italics in original) argue that \" the indigenous rights struggle brought the criterion of rights into tenure reforms globally, even if the initial intent involved ethnic identity, ancestral occupation and use of forestlands. \" The current trend in rights-based decentralized forest tenure, particularly ethnic identity rights, recognizes ancestral rights of indigenous peoples (Barry et al. 2010). In Latin America, Nicaragua and Bolivia in particular, the indigenous peoples' movement has successfully struggled to get formal recognition of traditional rights over their historic territories and forests (Larson et al. 2010). Forest tenure reform entails state recognition of traditional rights for people already living in and around the forests, as well as their customary laws. Often, forest tenure reform is comparable to the agrarian reform of the 1960s. However, unlike the latter, forest tenure is often not about property or ownership rights, but about use and access rights. There is a lack of agreement among scholars about the advantages of state recognition of identity-based forest tenure rights. For example, Von Beckman (1997) explains that, if the state in an attempt to bring (abstract) equality does not recognize identity-based rights, then it may deny traditional rights of the several indigenous and traditional forest-dependent communities. In contrast, Marfo et al. (2010) argue that state recognition of identity-based traditional laws and practices of tenure reform could lead to inequitable or discriminatory outcomes that may possibly continue to exclude certain sub-groups within the identity-based category. This dynamics of identity-based rights makes India's recent forest tenure reform – the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights Act), 2006 (henceforth Forest Rights Act) – a complex issue. The Adivasis or the scheduled tribes (henceforth used interchangeably with tribal people) of India is an administrative category used to bestow constitutional rights and privileges to marginalized ethnic groups. About 84 million tribal people are acknowledged as the original inhabitants living in isolated areas in forests and mountains. The scheduled tribes are not recognized as indigenous people even though India has voted in favour of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly in September 2007. The present-day struggle over scheduled tribes' forestland tenure can be traced back to India's colonial history. In general , tribal women are highly dependent on forest resources, with or without forest tenure rights. Yet, few studies have focused on women's forest access and tenure rights among the tribal populations of India. Many tribal societies were traditionally matrilineal and conferred women with higher status, inheritance rights and privileges than in mainstream Hindu society (Mitra 2008). This situation has been changing with the trend towards adaptation to the mainstream patriarchal society. In general, women's rights under forest tenure reform are not given priority, just as in the past they were not given priority under state agrarian reforms, and this has resulted in gendered discrimination within the family due to inheritance laws and alienation rights, and control of property (Agarwal 1994). Larson et al. (2010: 4) explain that the range of forest tenure rights varies from \" the titling of vast territories to indigenous communities, to the granting of small land areas for forest regeneration or the right to a share in timber revenues. \" Nevertheless, ownership rights and key decision making in forest management remains with the government. Sunderlin et al.'s (2008: 15) study on global forest tenure reform states that \" the extension of statutory tenure rights to communities and households does not mean women will enjoy the benefits of full citizenship and equity. \" This will depend on the kind of rights and resources that are transferred by the state, who are included or excluded and why, and how recognition of forest tenure affects access rights of traditionally excluded groups like tribal women. There is a huge knowledge gap in the scientific literature regarding tribal women's access to forestland and forest resources, primarily because property rights, particularly in South Asia, have been a gendered issue (Agarwal 1994). The fundamental question, therefore, is how the Forest Rights Act 2006, which is meant to be a rights-based decentralized forest tenure reform, affects the access rights of forest-dependent tribal women. This article investigates two dimensions of tribal women's access to forestland and resources based on a mixture of national level legislation and customary rules. Forest governance in areas inhabited by tribal groups is based on a mixture of the newly formed village forest committees of the national Forest Rights Act (henceforth, the village FRA committees), gram panchayats (the elected government administrative body for one or more villages), the Joint Forest Management (henceforth, the JFM) committees and customary rules. The first dimension focuses on the tribal women's individual ability to claim, control and access forestland and resources. The second dimension reflects tribal women's collective capacity to gain access to forest resources and their ability to participate in local level institutions. In this article, the individual and collective dimensions of access rights are examined using access theory as proposed by Ribot and Peluso (2003) and applied in an empirical case study of Bhil tribal women in western India. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section outlines the broad context of forest tenure reform with emphasis on India's new decentralized Forest Rights Act (2006). Further, it summarizes the importance of a rights-based access approach in property rights. The third section provides background on the research site, the Bhil tribal people and the research methods used. The research results and discussion based on 54 in-depth qualitative interviews and two focus group discussions of forest-dependent Bhil tribal women is presented in section four. The discussion highlights the implications of the Forest Rights Act for Bhil tribal women's individual access rights in terms of their social identity and their collective ability to participate in forest governance decision making. In section five, some conclusions are drawn and the future implications of the Forest Rights Act for tribal women's access to forest are discussed.","doi":"10.1505/146554811797406615","journal":null,"aid":49}

Through a comparison of two carbon-forestry projects in central Tanzania, we investigated both the livelihood effects of these projects and the risk and benefit perceptions of project administrators and the government. Both projects have been unable to gain national government approval, and we find evidence of mixed benefits for local communities. Village communities participating in one program consistently identified environmental and social benefits of planting trees locally and judged them as more important than carbon payments. A key variable is ownership, as villagers that have forfeited their land to a plantation have little stake in the program, whereas villagers participating in a community-based program own their trees. Our results suggest that enhancing ties to local ownership can contribute to sustainable development while better enhancing the potential of the carbon market to work for the rural poor in developing countries.","doi":"10.1177/1070496509353538","journal":{"name":"The Journal of Environment & Development","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":51}

An evaluation of Ecuador's SocioPáramo program","authors":"Bremer L. L. and Farley K. A. and Lopez-Carr D.","dAbstract":"PES programs have been touted as a means to achieve conservation goals while also alleviating poverty and promoting rural development. However, the degree to which these goals are met depends, in part, on accessibility and desirability of programs targeting rural communities and smallholders. Empirical research on factors motivating or dissuading PES landowner participation remains limited and a more complete understanding of these factors is critical to improving PES social equity outcomes. In this paper, we evaluate factors facilitating and constraining participation in Ecuador's SocioPáramo program , a recently launched PES initiative targeting highland Andean grasslands (páramos). We conducted semi-structured interviews with all community landowner participants who had enrolled by May 2011, the majority of individual landowner participants who had enrolled by October 2010, and several non-participant communities and individuals. We found that, while SocioPáramo is attracting substantial participation among rural farmers and communities, a number of factors, including land tenure requirements , legal or biophysical land-use restrictions, and a need for pre-existing social, human, and financial capital, make SocioPáramo more accessible and desirable to larger, and often wealthier, landowners. While motivations for enrolling in the program varied, a key similarity among participants was access to alternative livelihood sources, a low opportunity cost associated with program land-use regulations, and a high value placed on the water provisioning services of the páramo. The majority of participants described incentives as a \" reward \" for conserving, as a means to strengthen existing conservation efforts or land security, or as a means to compensate for legal or biophysical land use restrictions. Our results suggest that the broader context of land tenure security, access to social capital, environmental attitudes , and alternative livelihood strategy development may require more attention in order to achieve greater participation among rural smallholders and communities. These results provide useful lessons for developing and adapting this and other PES programs so that they can better meet social goals.","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2013.08.002","journal":{"name":"Land Use Policy","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":847}

In order to reduce soil erosion on sloped lands, the Chinese government has responded by implementing large-scale, ecological rehabilitation programs, including the \" Grain for Green \" reforestation project. This program involves financial incentives to transition farmers into other economic activities with the goal of reducing ecological pressures and degradation. Because of the scope and potential impacts from these programs, detailed research is needed to understand their social and ecological effects. This paper reports on research conducted in Tianquan County, Sichuan Province, and Wuqi County, Shaanxi Province , that evaluates the effects of the program upon local economies and household livelihood systems. The paper argues that the successful conversion of farmland under \" Grain for Green \" depends upon local government involvement, local economic development, and funding for local projects. Without economic development within rural economies, we conclude that farmers will remain dependent upon continued subsidy assistance to meet the policy's ambitious environmental restrictions, thereby undermining the program's long-term sustainability.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.03.002","journal":null,"aid":60}

Introduction Recent studies highlight links between human vulnerability in the world's poorest countries and exposure to multiple stressors acting across scales in synergy with climate change (Leichenko and O'Brien, 2008). The 'double exposure' analysis by Leichenko and O'Brien, and the later Southern Africa Vulnerability Initiative (SAVI) framework (O'Brien et al., 2009) show how multiple stressors interact through three pathways related to context, outcome and feedback. However, many scientific studies continue to examine the impacts of climate change in isolation from other changes (Felton et al., 2009). Indeed, in this paper we argue that the failure to consider how different types of change interact and undermine the ability of poor people to cope with multiple stressors may lead to policy interventions which in themselves act as stressors. In this paper we explore perceptions and responses to multiple stressors at four coastal study sites in south-eastern Africa. We highlight how deliberate interventions to advance development interact with other climate and non-climate stressors. Many past vulnerability studies in poor countries have focused on land and agricultural systems, with relatively little consideration of coastal and marine social-ecological system components (Reid and Vogel, 2006; Paavola, 2008; e n v i r o n m e n t a l s c i e n c e & po l i c y 1 3 ( 2 0 1 0 ) 4 8 5 – 4 9 Marine Protected Area in Tanzania – are perceived to further erode resilience and exacerbate vulnerabilities. We suggest this is a form of policy misfit, where policies developed to address a specific issue do not take account of cross-scale dynamics of change, the interactions between multiple stressors, nor longer term climate change. This policy misfit may be remedied by a move towards adaptive forms of governance, and necessitates an explicit focus on building the adaptive capacity of the poor and most vulnerable in society. # 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Bryan et al., 2009). However, coastal zones will experience significant impacts arising from storms, floods and sea level rise. In Africa, coastal cities such as Cape Town, Maputo and Dar es Salaam with large and growing populations will be affected. With climate change, Africa's climate generally is predicted to become increasingly more variable, and extreme weather events are expected to be more frequent and severe, with increasing risks in socioeconomic and biophysical terms (Boko et al., 2007). Southern Africa is likely to experience higher temperatures and more erratic rainfall although the differences between coastal and inland areas, and between different locations, are not well accounted for in the generalisations from current model predictions. Any impacts in coastal areas may be especially varied. However, production systems and economic growth are likely to be affected across the region (Twomlow et al., 2007). Thus, there is a need for greater understanding of how vulnerability in coastal areas is shaped, for example by climate interacting with changes such as new tourism development, urbanisation and land use transformation, and how it may be reduced amid such complexity. The paper sets out the methods employed, and then outlines the multiple stressors that people at our study sites are exposed to. These stressors include climate change but also past and present policies, including river management and coastal conservation and development. The paper explores how these interventions affect peoples' ability to cope with other stressors. We then discuss how policies might be re-orientated to enhance rather than undermine local scale resilience and adaptive capacities. 1","doi":"10.1016/j.envsci.2010.06.003","journal":null,"aid":61}

This contrastive study of 200 households in two eco-marketing zones in Myanmar (accessible Central Myanmar vs. isolated Rakhine State) uses regression analysis to test three hypotheses derived from the previous literature to explain behavioral intentions and positive/negative environmental behavior. All three hypotheses were rejected, suggesting strong country specificity in selecting optimal behavior-based policies for forest conservation and non-destruction. Policy orientations were formulated to help reverse environmental degradation, promote community-oriented activities toward positive environmental behaviors, and provide sustainable pathways out of poverty for rural households. The main problem in Central Myanmar emerges as one of motivation, which could be promoted by public awareness programs, outside employment and financial viability. In Rakhine State, where the environmental footprint is heavier, policies should empower conservation by providing both technologies and the feeling of self-efficacy, particularly on the part of older people operating non-specialized farms close to the road.

Coral reefs, the most diverse and complex marine ecosystem provide economic services for millions, but are seriously threatened worldwide because reef-building corals are experiencing bleaching phenomena and a steady decline in abundance. The resources of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Cartagena, Colombia, are in constant decline, despite a current management plan and on-site staV, urging new conservation actions. A multidisciplinary team gathered to evaluate management eVectiveness including biophysical, socioeconomic and governance indicators. Coral cover and Wsh diversity and abundance were low both inside and outside the MPA, which suggests a limited eYciency of management. Currently, the MPA is a reef with low coral cover and high algae cover as well as large dead coral areas, which are generally signs of highly degraded reef habitats. Live coral cover in the MPA was represented by pioneer coral species such as Agaricia tenuifolia and Porites astreoides. Nonetheless, 35% of the scleractinian species sampled in the area harbored more than one zooxanthellae symbiont, which suggests potential resistance and resilience against coral bleaching. Maintenance of trophic structure and functional diversity is an important endeavor that should be a priority for management in order to allow ecosystem resilience.

It is important because it involves highly threatened species that can cause significant economic damage and be killed in retribution. Yet, to date, no quantitative study has sought to test possible solutions for preventing this form of human–wildlife conflict. 2. From February 2007 to August 2009, we monitored crop-raiding patterns across a Sumatran agroforest landscape to determine background levels of human–orangutan conflict. We also intensively monitored a subset of 50 farms to assess changes in farmer attitudes towards orangutan management ; differences between farmer reported and independently enumerated monetary loss from crop raiding; and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques in reducing orangutan crop raiding on 35 treatment farms (25 trialling noise deterrents and 10 trialling tree nets) in comparison with 15 control farms over a pre-trial (12 month) and a trial (18 month) phase. Five months after the trials had ended, the ongoing use or uptake of the techniques were assessed. 3. Across the wider landscape, background levels of mean daily orangutan crop-raiding incidents per month (±SE) farms did not significantly differ between the pre-trial (9AE1 ± 3AE7) and trial (7AE1 ± 4AE3) phases, whilst on the 35 treatment farms it reduced significantly. Furthermore, crop yield increased (+60AE8%) on the netted trial trees, but reduced ()27AE4%) on the control farm trees. Despite this, there was no subsequent use of this technique, unlike those farmers (40%) who continued using the less-effective noise deterrents. 4. Farmer participation in the project yielded unexpected and positive attitude changes, from preferring orangutan removal (pre-trial) to in situ management with crop protection measures (post-trial). However, project participation may have increased farmer expectations of receiving compensation because the treatment farmers consistently overestimated their crop losses, unlike the control farmers who did not. 5. Synthesis and applications. Whilst human–orangutan conflicts caused substantial losses to local livelihoods, the identification of an effective mitigation method (nets) neither guaranteed its continued use nor uptake. Developing easy to install nets for valuable tree crops is therefore recommended. Nevertheless, the project intervention efforts did create benign farmer attitudes towards orangutan management, an essential prerequisite for managing large-bodied mammals in conflict with people.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02109.x","journal":null,"aid":66}

To consider this problem, we investigated the implications of China's national and regional policies related to the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) for poverty in the dryland regions of northern Shaanxi Province. We found that 34.9, 47.0, and 59.8% of farmers, livestock grazers, and forest workers respectively, felt that their livelihoods had been adversely affected by the NFCP due to the ban on logging and grazing imposed by this program, and they perceived additional economic losses because they were not adequately compensated for their economic losses under the program. These perceptions are supported by economic data. In addition, our results showed that the poorer the survey respondent, the greater the likelihood they believed that they had suffered from the implementation of the NFCP. Although Chinese citizens have become more favorable towards environmental conservation efforts, the poorest citizens still need considerable help to make it possible for them to participate in both economic development and environmental restoration.","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.04.022","journal":null,"aid":69}

Semistructured interviews were conducted in 2006 and 2007 with leaders (N = 16) and household heads (N = 102) of smallholder communities in the reserve and its buffer zone. Complementary qualitative and quantitative analyses of interview data reveal that household head attitude towards the reserve is primarily associated with loss or gain of resource use rights; there is a significant difference in attitude between the household heads interviewed in the reserve and those in the buffer zone. Communities in the region used to share certain lands and floodplains, especially for the extraction of fish, poletimber, and thatch palm. With the reserve's establishment, only those who lived within the reserve were allowed to continue using previously shared resources, while the access of neighboring communities, now in the buffer zone, was banned from most of the reserve. A linear predictive model reveals that attitude towards the reserve also relates to location and household demographic variables, hypothesized to influence the household's capacity to respond to losses in income sources and subsistence means. Comparisons of leaders' and residents' responses suggest that although involuntary economic displacement has affected many locals, government authorities have not addressed the issue satisfactorily, at least from the perspective of those displaced, thus obscuring the conservation-related exclusion that occurred.","doi":"10.1016/j.geoforum.2011.04.008","journal":null,"aid":71}

Now it is clear that integrating fishers in management processes is key to resource conservation, but it is less clear how to do it. Here, based on a literature review and new information, we present and analyze a case in which the participation of fishers in the management process was crucial in recovering an overexploited small-scale fishery for the pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) in the Amazon Basin, Brazil. In 8 years of experimental management, from 1999 to 2006, the population of pirarucu increased 9-fold (from about 2200 to 20,650 individuals), harvest quotas increased 10-fold (from 120 to 1249 individuals), and fishers' participation in the management process increased and they benefited from increased monetary returns. Additionally, the number of communities conducting the management scheme increased from 4 in 1999 to 108 in 2006, following the demands of fishers and regional government agencies. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the participation of fishers in the management of other small-scale fisheries in the world can be improved by focusing on (1) applying the knowledge and skills of fishers in resource monitoring and management, (2) bridging knowledge systems among all involved stakeholders, (3) collaborating with fishers that are interested in, and capable of conducting, resource conservation schemes, and (4) conducting management under conditions of uncertainty.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":72}

The AF had the main objectives to provide a consistent contribution to the State budget and to improve rural livelihoods through an equitable and effective redistribution of forest-related benefits. After a decade of implementation, and about €85 million redistributed to about 50 councils, the literature unanimously evaluates the livelihood impacts of the distribution of the AF to communities as weak. Less comprehensive assessments have been carried out on the impacts of distribution of the AF to local governments. This paper discusses the potential of the AF as a tool for local development through local councils, with particular attention to the economic, equity and governance issues. One of the most significant findings is that mayors, although elected and unanimously blamed for embezzlements and mismanagement of the AF, are often only scapegoats in a complex political system that does not allow the rural population to directly sanction the misuse of the AF via the current electoral system.-MVONDO et L.

La RFA avait pour objectifs principaux de fournir une contribution régulière au budget de l'Etat, et d'améliorer le niveau de vie rural grâce à une redistribution efficace et équitable des bénéfices financiers liés à la forêt. Après une décennie de mise en pratique, et environ 85 millions d'euros redistribués à environ 50 communes, les rapports évaluent d'une façon unanime que les impacts socio-économiques de la distribution de la RFA aux communautés ont été faibles. Des études moins poussées ont été lancées sur les impacts de la distribution de la RFA sur les communes rurales. Cet article examine le potentiel de la RFA en tant qu' outil du développement local au travers des conseils municipaux, avec une attention particulière donnée aux questions d'efficacité économique, d'équité et de gouvernance. L'un des résultats les plus importants est que certains maires, bien que blamés à l'unanimité pour fraude et mauvaise gestion de la RFA, ne sont souvent que des boucs émissaires dans un système politique complexe qui ne permet pas à la population rurale de sanctionner directement la mauvaise utilisation de la RFA.

However, we observe a total absence of the recognition of the value of living nature and of nature as an environment of culture and human existence. It is predominantly guided by the philosophy of utilitarian development. It is not only observed in the developed world, but also in less developed world, including countries like India, policy formulation to arrest environmental degradation has failed to address the livelihood issues of marginal communities like pastoralists located in the high altitude of Western and Eastern Himalayas. As a result the term 'sustainable development' has become a misnomer, at least for those highland pastoralists. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the transhumance activity (known as gothwala system) as a means of livelihood which is in existence in the mountain settlement in Lachung valley, located in the east Himalayan State of Sikkim, India and the role played by traditional local body of governance, the 'Dzumsa' towards managing the natural resources, especially forest and fodder, in a sustainable manner. It also shows a process of natural resource management which is not based on modern scientific knowledge but age old traditional knowledge of indigenous tribes. To a large extent, it works in conformity with the true essence of the definition of sustainable development which cautioned us that in the long run, human and natural systems can not economically be viable unless they are also ecologically sound and socially responsible. However, to protect the forest from extraction of firewood, save the medicinal plants from grazing of cattle, the Government of Sikkim has enacted a law to abolish the 'gothwala system' without providing any alternative livelihoods. In the next as well as in the concluding section, a critical evaluation has been made towards the conservation approach followed by formal institutions in the name of sustainable development and how a conflict has arisen between conservation and existing livelihood opportunities.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":75}

The aims of the study are based on two key hypotheses: Community Based Co-Management (CBCM) has changed the livelihood assets of local community residents in the study area; and the changes in livelihood assets are different between participators in CBCM and non-participators. The findings of the study show that the total value of livelihood assets was 0.56 in 2006 and increased to 0.71 in 2010, which supported hypothesis A and illustrated that livelihood assets indeed changed significantly from 2006 to 2010. Livelihood asset conditions are significantly different between participators and non-participators in CBCM projects (0.77 for participators and 0.51 for non-participators), and the findings, taken together, also supported hypothesis B. Physical capital does not show a remarkable increase, but application of energy-saving stoves, mash gas pools, and the use of alternative energy sources optimize the household energy structure and decrease the amount of firewood used. The change in natural capital demonstrates that the majority of local community residents, in their subjective consciousness, are willing to protect forest resources and biodiversity. In terms of human capital, the capacity building of local people shows significant improvement, but their health status and medical situation are associated with a series of problems that need to be resolved. In terms of financial capital, household income and expenditures both show significant improvement, and alternative and diverse livelihood approaches have appeared and been well developed. Social capital shows significant improvements in some aspects regarding the status of women and the relationship between the government and communities. Finally, we advocate incurring the lowest natural resource costs to obtain the greatest benefits in the process of sustainable livelihood development and forest common governance.

Findings show that CBCM appears to have significantly increased livelihoods for local community residents overall. Forest condition and attitudes about forest conservation were also improved. However, economic benefits were not enjoyed uniformly within the communities because, although CBCM projects are nominally available to all, certain subgroups within communities are less likely to participate. Greater education, being married, and access to information are all strongly correlated with participation and thus the economic benefits of CBCM projects. Women, although they frequently participate in household decisions, are infrequent participants in CBCM projects, perhaps because project design does not meet their needs. Future improvements to CBCM project design should include increased access to information, education, and equitable treatment of diverse stakeholders in the decision-making process. Such improvements would likely lead to improvements in livelihoods as well as more sustainable forest management and conservation.","doi":"10.1007/s10113-012-0316-3","journal":null,"aid":79}

The results suggest that characteristics of wild species interact with economic factors to determine nuisance conditions. Households more proximate to the forest and with larger landholdings are more vulnerable to crop raiding while livestock loss is largely a result of illegal forest grazing. Species that have succeeded under the current conservation regime are the most frequent raiders and predators while declining species cannot and do not avail themselves of domesticated resources.

The legislation was changed in 1960 and this led to cautious institutional reforms, whereby responsibility for wildlife was gradually devolved to landholders who were encouraged to use it profitably. This was achieved without the State abrogating its ultimate responsibility for the wellbeing of the resource. The CAMPFIRE programme was a response to the particular requirements of communally managed wild resources. Successful implementation required that appropriate institutions were in place. These allowed the peasants a meaningful say in the management of their wildlife and permitted them to use it profitably to generate a sufficient incentive to persuade them to conserve the resource on their land. As on large-scale commercial ranches, socioeconomic factors proved more significant than ecological considerations in preserving wildlife on communally occupied land that is representative of much of Africa and the Third World.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Biodiversity and Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":83}

Our examination of social resilience focused on indicators of the flexibility of household livelihood portfolios and both formal and informal governance institutions, the capacity of communities to organize, their capacity to learn, and access to household assets and community infrastructure. In general, we found high levels of flexibility in formal institutions and livelihood portfolios and high levels of participation in decision-making and community groups. Together, these indicators suggest some latent capacity to adaptively manage resources, but this capacity may be offset by poor levels of trust between communities and resource managers, a poor understanding of the ways in which humans affect marine resources, inadequate feedback of ecological monitoring to communities, inflexibility in informal governance institutions, and a lack of assets to draw upon. We suggest that building desirable resilience in Madagascar's marine protected areas will require the following: investments in community-level infrastructure, projects to generate household income, and enhanced agricultural production to improve the well-being of communities; improvements in the capacity to learn through investments in formal and informal education; enhanced trust between park staff and local communities; empowerment of communities to govern and enforce natural resources; the increased accountability of leaders and transparency of governance processes; adequate cross-scale interaction with local, provincial, and national institutions; and the pursuit of these activities in ways that capitalize on community-specific strengths, such as high flexibility and the presence of sociocultural institutions such as taboos that regulate resource use.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":87}

M.","dAbstract":"Many tropical countries have recently implemented similar forest policies including large-scale afforesta-tion programmes and the devolution of land-use rights. Their success in enhancing livelihoods and contributing to improved environmental services has been widely questioned. This paper discusses the impacts of state afforestation efforts and forestry land allocation on farmers' land-use decisions in northern Vietnam. It links policy outcomes with factors located beyond the local level by analysing the decision-making process at the policy implementation stage. Our study suggests that the current national afforestation campaign has not successfully involved households in the forestry sector and that forestry land allocation to households has often disrupted existing land-use systems with little impact on afforesta-tion. These discrepancies between policy intentions and outcomes are partly linked to the relative freedom provinces have to interpret and adapt policies during the implementation stage. In this respect, the political and economic context has played a significant role in providing particular financial and bureaucratic incentives to the former State Forest Enterprises and to civil servants. However, we argue that these actors have been allowed or even encouraged to take advantage of these incentives by national policy-makers thanks to: (1) the lack of clarity or the poor adequacy of the policies designed at the central level, and (2) the blurred character of prevailing national discourses promoting afforestation and community-based forest management. We recommend that national policy-makers allow flexibility in policy implementation but develop mechanisms of accountability and control between the provincial and the central authorities.","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2008.06.003","journal":{"name":"Land Use Policy","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":89}

The majority of PES programs have been implemented in situations where the institutional framework and property rights are strong and target the behaviours of private landowners. By contrast, this paper compares three PES programs from a forest landscape in Cambodia, where land and resource rights are poorly defined, governance is poor, species populations are low and threats are high. The programs vary in the extent to which payments are made directly to individuals or to villages and the degree of involvement of local management institutions. The programs were evaluated against three criteria: the institutional arrangements, distribution of costs and benefits, and the conservation results observed. The most direct individual contracts had the simplest institutional arrangements, the lowest administrative costs, disbursed significant payments to individual villagers making a substantial contribution to local livelihoods, and rapidly protected globally significant species. However, this program also failed to build local management organisations or understanding of conservation goals. By contrast the programs that were managed by local organisations were slower to become established but crucially were widely understood and supported by local people, and were more institutionally effective. PES programs may therefore be more sustainable when they act to empower local institutions and reinforce intrinsic motivations.","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.010","journal":null,"aid":90}

These complex concepts were captured in order to strengthen performance assessments of CBNRM. Horizontal accountability was weak across the five conservancies studied and conservancy leaders could transfer more information to their constituents. Smaller and older conservancies displayed higher rates of information transfer, but horizontal accountability was not linked to different levels of socioeconomic benefits. In order to properly study the potential connections between good governance and the provision of socioeconomic benefits within CBNRM, the measures used in this study require further refinement.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892910000676","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":91}

We reviewed three wildlife monitoring systems in indigenous lands and sustainable development reserves in Brazilian Amazonia and one in Namibian Caprivi conservancies, analyzing the strategies adopted and conditions that facilitated local empowerment, as well as potential impacts on conservation. This provided insights into potential avenues to strengthen empowerment outcomes of monitoring systems in Latin America and Africa. We assessed four dimensions of empowerment at individual and community scales: psychological, social, economic, and political. The conditions that facilitated local empowerment included the value of natural resources, rights to trade and manage resources, political organization of communities, and collaboration by stakeholders. The wide range of strategies to empower local people included intensifying local participation, linking them to local education, feeding information back to communities, purposefully selecting participants, paying for monitoring services, marketing monitored resources, and inserting local people into broader politics. Although communities were socially and politically empowered, the monitoring systems more often promoted individual empowerment. Marketing of natural resources promoted higher economic empowerment in conservancies in Namibia, whereas information dissemination was better in Brazil because of integrated education programs. We suggest that practitioners take advantage of local facilitating conditions to enhance the empowerment of communities, bearing in mind that increasing autonomy to make management decisions may not agree with international conservation goals. Our comparative analysis of cases in Latin America and Africa allows for a greater understanding of the relationships between resource monitoring systems, local empowerment, and conservation.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":93}

This paper analyzed factors influencing local people's participation in forest management program in Sissili and Ziro provinces, southern Burkina Faso based on data collected through a household survey of 165 members of forest management groups using factor analysis and multiple regression. Factor analysis resulted in a three-factor solution, which accounted for 64.82% of the total variance. Participation in decision-making, followed by participation in forest conservation and economic benefits were found to be the main factors influencing participation in the forest management program. Gender, household size, income source, land tenure status and technical assistance also appeared to influence members' participation in the program. The results indicate that participatory management program can be enhanced by changing the administrative structure of forest management groups in order to empower members in decision-making processes. In addition, increasing women's participation and more equitable benefit-sharing among user groups are essential in improving the success of the participatory forest management program. Thus, policies reforms to improve the structure of the forest management groups and to establish equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms are essential to improve the participation of local people in the forest management program and, hence, require immediate attention.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":94}

However, the role of women and children in gleaning fisheries tends to be underestimated and poorly documented although they make significant contributions to coastal food security and income generation. Gleaning is the harvesting of marine resources with simple implements or by hand in the intertidal zone, with the bulk of the catch consisting of bivalves and other invertebrates. This activity and its harvest are typically unreported or under-reported in fisheries statistics. Usually, these resources also go unmanaged. Gleaned species are characterized by high yields due to high levels of natural productivity of tropical intertidal zones in estuaries and reef flats. A large portion of these harvests are for household food and income. Emerging models of successful management of this type of gleaned fishery are found in Fiji, where women gleaners have established small-scale no-take zones on the reef flats to manage an important species of clam locally called kaikoso (Tawake 2001). These no-take zones were recognized by village chiefs and established with technical support from the Department of Fisheries and The University of the South Pacific. Participatory monitoring of these \" Locally Managed Marine Areas \" (LMMAs) has shown increased abundance and size of cockles inside the no-take zones and in adjacent fishing areas. Higher harvests also occurred in the downstream side of the no-take zones, providing direct benefits to harvesters.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":95}

M. and Saigal S.","dAbstract":"Forest tenure reform has opened economic and livelihood opportunities for community forestry management through the devolution of management rights under broader decentralisation reforms. However, the transfer of rights and associated power to forest communities is usually partial. The view of property as composed of 'bundles of rights' allows for the disaggregation of rights transferred from government to local people. In practice, it is common that rights held by natural resource stakeholders encompass only part of the rights bundle. This partial transfer of rights shapes community forestry institutions and the manner in which they function. When communities and state agencies share responsibilities and benefi ts of forest management, they collaborate within co-management systems. Co-management systems are attractive to governments because they open avenues for local participation in resource governance and more equitable benefi t-sharing while maintaining some level of state control. However, co-management systems can place a greater burden on community level actors without providing the corresponding benefi ts. As a result, co-management can fail to meet expectations. In response, the promotion of community forestry may require greater emphasis on adjusting forest regulatory frameworks, institutions, and agencies, to allow more freedom by community-level actors in developing forest management systems.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.97481","journal":{"name":"Conservation and Society","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":96}

Using concepts from the literature on participation, conservation, and political ecology, this research explored the participation of marginal groups, i.e., poor, women, lower caste, and landless, in management institutions in Nepal's Annapurna Conservation Area. Field work for this research was conducted through the use of interviews and participant observation during August– October 2010. Results show that although marginal groups were involved in local management institutions, their representation was minimal and had not led to meaningful participation or empowerment to influence the decisions being made in conservation and development programs. Our study findings indicate that the involvement of marginal groups in local initiatives is complex and influenced by several factors. The study concludes that the Annapurna Conservation Area Project needs to reorient its conservation projects by adopting a more inclusive form of participation and move beyond the quota system.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":100}
{"filename":"Dahlberg and Burlando 2009","year":2009,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION The fortress-type approach to conservation that has been common in protected-area management throughout the 20th century has been strongly criticized because of its negative impact on local livelihoods (Wilshusen et al. 2002, Dowie 2009). Alternative approaches that aim to integrate conservation and development have been formally endorsed by both national and international conservation organizations (Borrini-Feyerabend et al. 2004). The main reasons for integration relate to poverty alleviation, democracy, human rights, and more efficient conservation, and such efforts commonly include so-called Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs) (Adams and Hulme 2001). The rationale of ICDPs is that economic loss to local communities caused by restricted access to natural resources in protected areas should be compensated through alternative income sources, thereby reducing dependence on these resources and increasing awareness of conservation benefits (Garnett et al. 2007). However, many ICDPs face problems because generated benefits are not sufficient to replace reliance on land and other resources (Schmidt-Soltau 2004) or they attract more people, thereby increasing pressure on natural resources (Wittemyer et al. 2008). The ICDP model has been subjected to similar criticism as that aimed at conventional development projects. That is, projects are often too limited in space and time, initiated and owned by external actors, have inappropriate funding mechanisms, and reach a limited number of people. Furthermore, participation tends to be superficial and promised benefits unrealistic, and an awareness of the broader social– ecological context is often lacking (Sayer and Wells 2004, Springer 2009). http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art37/ The gap between policy visions and actual outcomes has generated debate concerning whether and how the dual goals of conservation and development may be reconciled (Adams et al. 2004, Brockington et al. 2006, Agrawal and Redford 2009). Some fear that one will take precedence over the other (Sanderson and Redford 2003, Brockington et al. 2006), although many governments, international NGOs, and national conservation organizations state that they believe in win–win scenarios (IUCN 2002, Roe and Elliott 2006). It has been argued that this perceived need for consensus, aimed at satisfying all parties, denies the complexity of the issue and hides important aspects of power relations, politics, and justice (Büscher 2008). Conservation and development do not have to be irreconcilable goals, but they need to be realistically considered as part of a political and social process of engagement and negotiation among different interests (Brechin et al. 2002). The creation of protected areas always entails trading one land-use option for another, and choices among different interests have to be continuously faced. Thus, tradeoffs between the goals of conservation and development, as well as within them, are the norm rather than the exception. Trade-offs are complex, appear in many guises, and are perceived differently depending on the vantage point (Sunderland et al. 2008). This is why the importance of transparency in negotiations has been highlighted (Brown 2004). South Africa has an exceptionally high biodiversity, but also a large human population where many have endured unjust, exclusionary conservation practices for over a century. As a result, protected areas are hotly contested (Kepe et al. 2004, Ramutsindela 2004). Since the democratic transition in 1994, the government has embarked on a challenging path aimed at conserving biodiversity, alleviating poverty, and redressing previous dispossessions (Magome and Murombedzi 2003, Carruthers 2007). Northeastern KwaZulu-Natal is a case in point. The region has been severely neglected in terms of development (Guyot 2002) and at the same time many protected areas have been established here, such as the country's first Natural World Heritage Site, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, formerly named the Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park. The integration of conservation and development in iSimangaliso Wetland Park, hereafter referred to as the Wetland Park, has been described as a win–win situation (Porter et al. 2003), but this has been challenged from both a conservation and a humanrights point of view (Guyot 2002, Jones 2006). We study the case of one community that borders the Wetland Park to explore opportunities and risks inherent in interventions aimed at integrating conservation and development. The study provides a context-specific analysis of interactions between the Wetland Park and the community, with the aim of drawing some general lessons concerning links between process and outcomes. Here, process refers specifically to the described interventions, but also to the local socio-environmental setting, including changes in land use and management. The qualitative research approach applied allows the interests, experiences, and perceptions of different stakeholders to be heard, as well as juxtaposed and contrasted. Finally, in a discussion based on insights gained, we reflect on varying forms of trade-offs, and how these may relate to the sustainability of different initiatives to promote both conservation and development.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":101}

Despite these efforts, cacao production is declining and is being replaced by less diverse systems that have lower biodiversity value. Understanding the factors that influence household land use is essential in order to promote cacao agroforestry systems as a viable livelihood strategy. We incorporate elements of livelihoods analyses and socioeconomic data to examine cacao agroforestry systems as a livelihood strategy compared with other crops in Talamanca. Several factors help to explain the abandonment of cacao agroforestry systems and their conversion to other land uses. These factors include shocks and trends beyond the control of households such as crop disease and population growth and concentration, as well as structures and processes such as the shift from a subsistence to a cash-based economy, relative prices of cacao and other cash crops, and the availability of market and government support for agriculture. We argue that a livelihoods approach provides a useful framework to examine the decline of cacao agroforestry systems and generates insights on how to stem the rate of their conversion to less diverse land uses.","doi":"10.1007/s10531-007-9192-4","journal":{"name":"Biodivers Conserv","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":102}

To enhance MPA management performance, stakeholders are increasingly being invited to discuss, debate, and develop rules about how people should interact with marine ecosystems. Using social and ecological data from a rapid assessment of 31 MPAs and their associated communities in the wider Caribbean, this study investigates stakeholder participation in MPA planning and management, and how participants' views of process quality relate to MPA performance. Findings indicate that (1) participants tended to be male, resource users, participate in community organizations, and have lived fewer years in the community associated with an MPA than non-participants; (2) simply participating was not associated with perceptions of the social and ecological performance of MPAs, however, perceptions of process quality were positively related to views of performance; and (3) resource users' perceptions of an MPA's ecological performance were likely shaped by a variety of factors. Conservation practitioners should be aware that participa-tory MPA processes are complex and require careful planning if they are to contribute positively to marine conservation efforts.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":103}

To mitigate such conflicts requires a firm understanding of their underlying patterns. This situation is epitomized in Pakistan, where carnivore populations have been greatly reduced, but where no research has investigated the conflict patterns of large carnivore guilds with humans. Focusing in and around Machiara National Park (MNP), Azad Jammu and Kashmir region, we conducted the first such scientific study in Pakistan. From January 2004 to May 2007, 148 people lost their livestock to four carnivore species. Leopard was responsible for the majority (90.6%) of the 363 livestock killed, mainly goats (57.3%) and sheep (27.8%). Information-theoretic evaluation of a candidate set of regression models found that leopard kills inside villages were significantly higher for areas without electricity, while leopard kills outside villages were higher for pastoralists with larger herds that were further from MNP, with no effect from several guarding strategies used. Temporal leopard attacks were significantly and positively related to temperature, but not to rainfall, for goat kills, but not for other livestock kills. While leopard kills caused the greatest overall financial loss (19.8%) amongst carnivores, which negatively affected local tolerance towards leopard, disease caused greater livestock losses (72.7%). To improve both large carnivore and local livelihood prospects around MNP and across rural Pakistan, conservation and development projects should install village electricity supplies and vaccinate livestock, while the cost-effectiveness of different conflict mitigation strategies should be trialed.

Against this custodian forest management system, the local communities in different parts of India have mobilized repeatedly over a long time to protect their traditional rights of subsistence needs from forest resources. In keeping with this, the local forest fringe communities – Santal, Bhumij and Mahato tribal, and some low caste Hindus – in south West Bengal, the area of our study, mobilized repeatedly with various movements, such as the Chur Rebellion (1767–1805), the Naik Revolt (1806–1816) and the Hul Rebellion (1855), against Mughal and British rulers to protect their traditional rights on forestland (Dutta 1940, p. 35, Duyker 1987, pp. 28–35; Sarker and Das 2006a, p. 271). The revision of India's forest policy in 1988 marks a major departure from earlier policies. It recognized the need to fulfil the requirements of rural and tribal people for fuel wood, fodder, minor forest produce and small timber. It also stressed the need to create a movement for protection and development of forests. However, the benefit-sharing arrangements between states and forest communities differ widely between states within the country. Hence the issue is: do these benefit-sharing arrangement between states and forest communities meet the survival needs of poor forest communities, yet restrict the latter's illegal collection of timber forest products (TFPs)? The findings of two case studies in Gujarat (Naik 1997) show that unless survival needs for food and livelihood are met, participation in natural resource management remains threatened. The foundation of an innovative forest protection system in West Bengal began in 1989 and the participatory forest management was thus laid for the forests of south West Bengal, which covers approximately 38% of the total forest area of the state. While explaining the achievements of the JFM programme, the West Bengal State Forest Report (2000) states: As a result of participatory and joint forest management activities in south West Bengal the vast tract of scattered, over-exploited and degraded forests containing mainly the sal were resuscitated and restored to productivity with great improvement in quality and density. (State Forest Report (SFR) 2000, p. 47) Previously, the overexploitation of trees for timber was so severe that thousands of hectares of forest lands in south West Bengal, with the exception of Sundarban, were treated as barren land when the JFM was established; but such lands have been rehabilitated. Secondly, government revenue from the degraded forest was almost nil when the JFM was established, but has significantly increased since (Das and Sarker 2008, pp. 82–91, Sarker and Das 2008, p. 22). Despite such a successful achievement of the JFM programme in West Bengal there is still a moral hazard problem for the government because some households are hard to monitor, and continued illegal extraction of timber products by the JFM households is threatening the sustainability of forest resources. Besides, the pressure of population on forests in the long run leads to substantial damage of forest resources, causing acute environmental problems for West Bengal in the future (Das and Sarker 2002, p. 61).","doi":"10.1080/17487870903314617","journal":null,"aid":107}

Asian countries like India have notable amount of these forests, covering almost 30.16% of the total forest area (Roy et al. 1996). Due to unprecedented expansion of the urban industrial economy and exponential growth of human population in the past century, the dry deciduous forests have been the most affected because of their geographically centralised location in India and increased accessibility due to their unique plant associations and forest structure. Dry deciduous forests have been used as sources of timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) from time immemorial (Mahapatra and Tewari 2005 ). Presently in India, the highest environmentally vulnerable zones, with topsoil loss, desertification, biodiversity loss and crop failure, roughly coincide with dry deciduous forest-dominated ecosystems. Sustainable management of remaining parts of these forests is therefore of paramount importance, and hence development and establishment of broad guidelines towards achievement of objectives of management and utilisation of forest products without undesirable effects on the physical and social environment are essential. Adoption of several measures and approaches has marked initiatives to fulfil this concept of sustainable forest management (SFM) through establishment of criteria and indicators (C&I) (Ritchie et al. 2000). Since the Earth Summit of 1992, 150 countries and several international organisations have committed to develop C&I for SFM, and at present nine major regional *Corresponding author. Email: debajit.geo@gmail.com and international processes have been applied worldwide (Wijewardana 2008). In India, the Bhopal-India Process is the only functioning C&I framework at present. This process is bound to face difficulties in implementing it in community forestry or village-level Joint Forest Management (JFM) (Kotwal et al. 2008). Moreover, this process is inadequate for assessing the relationship between a community and a state-run forest department (FD) in terms of forest harvesting and sharing duties for forest protection. To assess the sustainability of community-driven forest management, especially in local forest management units (FMUs), a comprehensive C&I framework is urgently needed. In this study, a previously developed C&I framework was applied for assessment of functioning of forest protection committees (FPCs) in the dry deciduous forests of India through a 5-year monitoring programme. These FPCs are considered essential for JFM at FMU level in India. Hence, using this C&I framework consisting of 3 principles, 6 criteria, 12 indicators and 18 verifiers, an attempt was made to evaluate the success of JFM initiatives in implementing SFM in dry deciduous forests of the Nayagram Forest Range of West Bengal, India. Indian monsoonal deciduous forests occurring in areas having mean annual temperatures of 23–29 @BULLET C, mean annual precipitation of 700–1200 mm and 50–60% relative humidity. Although these forests are not exceptionally rich in biodiversity, like tropical rain forests, they contain a considerable flora and fauna. The floral community comprises Shorea robusta, Anogeissus latifolia, Dalbergia latifolia, Acacia lenticularis, Madhuca indica, Butea monosperma and Euphorbia nivulia. Dense bushes of Dendrocalamus strictus and Diospyros melanoxylon (Kendu) are generally found in moister areas. With increasing environmental degradation and demand for commercial timber, these Sal (S. robusta)-dominated forests are gradually being replaced by comparatively drier Tectona grandis through direct human intervention (Mishra et al. 2004). Similarly, native fauna like Panthera tigris and Tetracerus quadricornis are also becoming endangered due to poaching and forest area encroachment. Most of the remaining forests are now confined to eastern, central and south-eastern India. Due to a long history of socio-cultural isolation and ethnic segregation, these forests also contain concentrations of indigenous tribal populations, like the Santhals, Bhils and Mundas. These people have lived in the forests for many generations and have developed a unique harmony with their natural environment. However, due to nearly two centuries of colonial occupation followed by the timber-based commercial forestry policy of the post-independence Government of India (GOI), the ecological balance between these communities and the forests has been damaged severely. Only in the recent decades have serious attempts been made by both public and private institutions to implement SFM in the form of community forestry, under intense pressure from widespread campaigns and social movements led by post-colonial environmentalists and ecologists (Prasad 2004).","doi":"10.1080/13504509.2011.606549","journal":{"name":"International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Ecology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":108}

Assets in this particular context are defined as not only natural/ biological (land, water, common property resource, flora and fauna) but also social (i.e. community, family, social networks), economic (i.e. job, savings, credit), political (i.e. participation, empowerment) human (i.e. education, labour, health, nutrition) and physical (i.e. roads, markets, clinics, schools, bridges). Livelihood interventions are conscious efforts by an agency or an organization to promote and support livelihood opportunities for a large number of people (other than those directly or indirectly employed by them) (Dutta et al. 2004). The tenth five-year plan of Government of India the Planning Commission (Chaired by the Prime Minister) proposed to generate more than 10 million new jobs every year. Of the 1 billion Indian citizen, 325 million are involved in employment, of which 8% contribute 60% to the G.D.P. It is therefore clearly important to organize poor people into productive activity. Joint Forest Management (JFM) is a collaborative forest management programme with the involvement of rural communities living close to forests in protection and management of forest resources. In the pre-independence period the conversion of common property resources such as forests into the state management regime resulted in exacerbating the rates of deforestation. Post-Independence forest policies contributed to an expansion in agriculture production, met industrial demand for raw materials, and tightened control of forest lands through restricted access to forest and forest products (Haeuber 1993). After various cases reported from different parts of the country in relation to self initiative forest protection since the 1960s, and the efforts for creating partnership with people by the forest department in protection and management, the Govt. of India passed the National Forest Policy in 1988. This was framed as a pro-tribal policy and consequently the JFM resolution was declared in the year 1990 by the Govt. of India for the protection, management and development of the forests in India (Poffenberger 1995, Saxena 1997, Banerjee 1996). To date, 28 states of the Indian Union have passed the Government Resolution on JFM and over 84,000 forest protection committees (or Village Forest Committees or Van Suraksha Smaity) have been formed so far covering more than 17 million ha in the notified forest area. Under the JFM programme the state of Madhya Pradesh (M.P.) is a pioneer in implementing this programme. The Government of M.P. issued the first resolution relating to JFM in 1991, which was subsequently revised in 1995, 2000 and 2001. Steps are also being taken to integrate the local institutions by involving the Gram Sabha (village assembly) in the formation and function of JFM Committees. By the end of December 2002, 14,073 JFM Committees had been constituted, so that a total of about 60,000 sq. km of forest area was under JFM, which is about 63% of the total forest area of the State. More than 1.7 million families are involved in the programme.","doi":"10.1505/ifor.8.2.241","journal":{"name":"Forestry Review","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":115}

A. and Kyereh B. and Dietz T.","dAbstract":"Greater attention for law enforcement resulting from new forest governance initiatives may make livelihoods of people living in or near protected areas in the tropics more vulnerable due to restricted access and competing claims. This paper aims to provide a deeper insight into the livelihoods of inhabitants of the Tano Offin Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA) in Ghana's high forest zone and how these are becoming under greater pressure. It assesses the governance implications of the implementation of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) under the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan of the European Union and projects within the framework of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation plus (REDD+), with a focus on the need for social safeguards. The study shows that the inhabitants of admitted villages in GSBAs already have few legal livelihood options due to restricted access to the forest, which results in competing claims among resource users and with forest managers. Stronger law enforcement resulting from the FLEGT/VPA to combat illegal logging and the Ghana Forestry Commission's consideration to include GSBAs in its REDD+ programme is likely to further restrict inhabi-tants' access to forest resources, with the result being increasing competition for scarce resources. Social safeguards therefore need serious consideration when implementing new forest governance regimes. The authors argue that the politics of protected areas need to reconsider the position of the inhabitants by creating space to build a livelihood , paying them for taking care of nature or relocating them beyond the protected area. This might involve hard choices. What eventually is needed is a change towards interactive governance and adaptive co-management.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2013.03.005","journal":null,"aid":117}

The community forest user groups of lowland in Nepal have practiced low pricing strategy for high value forest products considering the access of socioeconomically poor households. However, the study suggests that even though the low pricing strategy was designed considering poor households, rich households greatly benefited from the forest benefits. The study further enlightens that the low price for high value forest products particularly timber is counterproductive for equitable benefit sharing among the user households in the areas of heterogeneous socioeconomic conditions. In addition, the strategy is defective for collecting adequate community fund and carrying out enough livelihood improvement activities at the local level.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2009.02.004","journal":null,"aid":119}

Both communities utilize the renewable resources of the wetlands on a traditional basis: fishery, small-scale agriculture and handicraft in Marituba, and latex, Brazilian nuts and fishery in Guapor6 Valley. Both communities are in the process of rapid and intense socioeconomic and biological change. In Marituba, the sugar-cane plantations and the capital-intensive irrigation schemes are threatening the existence of the varzea (floodplain); in Guapor6, rapid deforestation is threatening the livelihoods of local communities. The reaction of these communities is similar: both are fighting for the conservation of the wetland ecosystems as conditions for the survival of their culture and way of life.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Landscape and Urban Planning","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":121}

Introduction In many settings, there is an ecological inter-linkage between areas inside and outside protected areas. This explains why Hansen and DeFries (2007) observed that biodiversity conservation targets are not being met inside protected areas, which are in the front line of conservation, partly because of increasing adverse influence from activities carried on outside protected areas. Consequently, biodiversity conservation ought to take place outside protected areas as well. Accordingly, the actions of local communities crucially influence the success or failure of biodiversity conservation for two reasons. First, local communities are usually in charge of some areas outside protected areas, using these outside areas to provide for their own livelihoods. In some cases, the existence of perverse incentives discourages them from prioritising activities which complement biodiversity conservation . Second, the same perverse incentives also encourage environmentally unsustainable practices by local communities whenever they get access to protected areas as a result of either land restitution or pure encroachment. Furthermore, failure to conserve biodiversity outside protected areas will lead to more pressure being put on the protected areas, especially where local communities have resource rights inside as well. Harvesting of natural resources inside protected areas could potentially have two impacts. First, it could compromise the integrity of biodiversity as compared to regimes of no use. Second, it could negatively affect the ability of the protected areas to attract tourists and generate revenues to plough back into conservation. In South Africa, land degradation is perceived to be positively correlated with distribution of communal rangelands (Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, 2010). The Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park encompasses part of the ancestral site of the Khomani San \" bushmen \" . 2 As part of South Africa's land restitution programme, the Khomani San community was awarded land inside and outside the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in May 2002, together with the adjacent Mier community. 3 South African National Parks (SANParks) was tasked with co-managing the acquired land inside the park on behalf of the local communities as contractual parks. 4 are divided into the hunter–gatherer San and the pastoral Khoi (Barnard, 1992). 3 In addition, the Khomani San people were awarded additional and special rights in the remainder of the park because they lost more land in comparison to the Mier community during the establishment of the Park (Bosch and Hirschfeld, 2002). 4 A contract park is a protected area developed on land belonging to the government , private individuals, or a community. These parks are co-managed by the park authority in conjunction with the private individuals or community through a joint management board (JMB). Contractual parks are common in South Africa and Australia (see Reid et al., 2004 Contents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.09.001","journal":null,"aid":122}

J. and Schembri P. J.","dAbstract":"Fishers' attitudes and perceptions are critical for the success of fisheries protection areas with their associated biota, and a failure to understand fishers' behaviour may undermine the success of such fisheries management measures. In this study, we examine fishers' perception of a long-established exclusive fisheries zone around Malta and to investigate if the perceptions depend on fishers' demographic, economic, social characteristics and fishing activity of the fishers. A questionnaire survey was undertaken to evaluate the demographic characteristics, economic situation (costs and revenue) and fishers' activity and behaviour, together with their perception of the Fisheries Management Zone (FMZ). A total of 241 interview responses were analysed which was a response rate of 60%. The perception of most fishers was that the establishment of the FMZ has had an overall negative impact on their fishing activity and that the zone is not important for the protection of local fish stocks. When asked about the beneficial effect of the zone for fishers, most fishers from all backgrounds said that the zone does not benefit commercial fishers, but benefits mainly recreational fishers. The most evident differences in the perceptions and attitudes were between the full-time, part-time and recreational fishers. Fishers that have been fishing for more than 35 years and fishers from the main fishing village also had different attitudes from other fish-ers towards the FMZ. The results of this study suggest that the proportion of individual income derived from fishing was the strongest factor that influenced attitudinal differences, with home port and fishing experience having less important effects. The main differences in attitude among fishers were related to the protection and conservation effects of the zone, enhancement of resources and conflicts among user groups. The heterogeneity among fishers' attitudes revealed by the present study has important implications for the implementation of spatial closures. Some sectors of stakeholders may require additional incentives to accept restrictions on access if spatial management is to achieve its intended objectives.","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2009.06.019","journal":null,"aid":123}
{"filename":"Dinh et al. 2010","year":2010,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"IN TRODUCTION Vietnam forest cover declined dramatically from 50% in 1945 to 20% in 1989 , increased from 28.8% in 1998 to 33.2% in 2000 (Sang, 2006 ). Currently, the national forest cover is about 39.4% (MARD, 2009 ) of the total country . 36.7% of the forest area is protected in protected areas (Wil et al., 2006). Local people living inside or around them are dependent on available forest resources such as foodstuff, fuel wood, and construction materials. These people are mainly poor minorities and have few other livelihood opportunities, rather than from forest (Swinkels and Turk, 2006). Cat Tien Biosphere Reserve is the home of about 9,500 people in the CZ and 170,000 residents in the BZ belonging to 11 different ethnic groups; about 30% of the residents are estimated to live in poverty, especially ethnic minorities. About 60–80% of the population has the main source of living from forest resources (CTBR, 2006). Most of the local people within and around CTBR have depended much on forest resources for generations and have caused the major loss of the reserve (Sang et al., 2009). They harvest forest resources for both subsistence and cash income. Biodiversity in CTBR is endangered mainly by encroachment of forest land, illegal logging, poaching. This results in biological invasions, endangering endemic faunas and floras. This study demonstrates the importance and value of recognizing the forest resources in the daily lives of the local people, especially ethnic minorities; explores its contribution to their livelihoods so as to be intended to enhance food security, sustainable management and conservation of CTBR. M ATERI A LS A N D M ETHOD This study was based on 84 households from four hamlets in 3 zones of CTBR. The study was carried out in K'It Hamlet in the CZ; two hamlets in the BZ: Hamlet 4 in Ta Lai Commune, Dong Nai Province and hamlet 3 in Tien Hoang Commune, Lam Dong Province; and Hamlet 6 in the TZ belonging to Madagui Commune, Lam Dong province. The field data were collected in the period from October, 2005 to March, 2006 and in 2010 in the zones of CTBR. This area was chosen as a case study because the forest resources in the reserve continue to be degraded owing to a lot of pressures and a lot of species of plants and animals (especially Javan Rhinoceros) living in the sanctuaries are threatened by the local people . To reflect the status of the role of forest resources in CTBR to local people's income, the research aims at the following criteria to select the study sites: there are natural forests; for the CZ, there are indigenous ethnic minorities living in the surveyed hamlet; local residents depend on the forest resources; it is possible to access Drawing on the results of the surveys in 3 zones of Cat Tien Biosphere Reserve (CTBR) belonging to 3 provinces in Southern Vietnam, this paper examines the potential and contribution of forest resources to local people's livelihood. The main objectives of this study are to emphasize the variety of forest resources found in the area, to describe their contribution to the local people in 3 different zones of the reserve after the establishment of CTBR in 1998. 84 households were interviewed in 4 hamlets in 2005, 2006 and 2010. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) methods were implemented in order to obtain the information and data. The paper shows that in spite of the strict regulations on conservation the local people in the surveyed areas have been overusing forest resources for both subsistence and cash income. The findings confirm that the people in the core zone (CZ) and the buffer zone (BZ) still got very high forest resource income (FRI), whilst the residents in the transition zone (TZ) were less dependent on the forest resources. Moreover, the income of the residents in the CZ and the BZ increased significantly thanks to the forest resources. All of the well–off and medium households in the CZ got most of their income from forest resources, especially from uphill cultivation of cashew. It is recommended that higher–yielding cashew should be cultivated in areas outside the CZ where Javan Rhinoceros are living; more extension activities of agro–forestry and more participation of the local people involved in forest management and protection are necessary.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":124}

B. and Dixon A.","dAbstract":"Local community based institutions that coordinate the management of natural resources have been linked to socioecological resilience, adaptation and sustainability within rural livelihood systems throughout the developing world. The resilience and sustainability of related local institutions , however, is influenced by their relationship with external actors and institutions, particularly in facilitating, supporting or hindering local institutional arrangements. From this standpoint, this paper examines the case of local community based institutions involved in wetland management in western Ethiopia. Drawing upon the findings of participatory fieldwork undertaken in eight wetland-using communities of Illubabor and Western Wellega zones in Oromia Region it is argued that although local institutions do play a key role in coordinating wetland management and sustaining the benefits from wetlands, the sustainability and resilience of the institutions themselves is threatened by a range of factors. Despite their grassroots nature, their effectiveness is influenced by their reliance on local government backstopping that appears to have diminished in recent years, as well as a perceived lack of local government support for collective action over individual rights.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9493.2008.00343.x","journal":null,"aid":126}

L. and Jolly A. and Rasamimanana H. and Ratsimbazafy J. and Feistner A. T. and Ravoavy F.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Conservation Education in Madagascar Few Malagasy have ever seen a lemur in the wild; 90% of the population of Madagascar do not live near a forest. The few that do belong to two minorities: people living on the edge of the dwindling forests, and highly educated and dedicated conservationists. This is in spite of the fact that for westerners, Madagascar's fame is its endemic flora and fauna, including what may be more than 100 species of lemurs, many of them newly described [Mittermeier et al., 2008]. Malagasy culture includes many traditional proverbs inspired by domestic animals (cows or chickens) observed in daily life [MINESEB-UNICEF-SNIC, 1985–1988 MINESEBCRESED-UERP, 1998 Programmes Scolaires en Primaire & Au Lycee] and even some about the now extinct hippopotamus, but few about living endemic species, which reflects a general lack of knowledge or even a fear or dislike of these species [Ratsimbazafy, 2003]. Nevertheless, during the last two decades, conservation has become a government policy and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have contributed approximately $38 million in 2008–2009, to ensure preservation of endemic species in Madagascar [Rabenandrasana, 2005; Ratsimbazafy, 2003; Madagascar Environment Program Phase II (PEII)]. Because most Malagasy children are unfamiliar with Madagascar's unique species, it follows that as adults few will have an interest in conserving endangered biodiversity [Ratsimbazafy, 2003] . Typically , children are not taught about native wildlife or the science of conservation in schools. Instead, they are more familiar with giraffes, lions, tigers, and polar bears, animals that do not exist in Madagascar [Ratsimbazafy, 2003]. In fact, a television-watching child in the west knows more about lemurs than most Malagasy children do [Ratsimbazafy, 2003; Jolly, personal observation]. There are three general causes for this, all of them deep-seated. First, is the geography and human population distribution on the island-continent. Second, there is a long history of neglect of biodiversity within the main educational system. Third, Madagascar was the tenth poorest country in the world by the start of the twenty-first century; in fact, the poorest that did not have civil or external wars—so there were few funds for conservation education [World Development Report, 2000/2001. The economic constraints both reflect and exacerbate unequal power between peasants, elites, and foreign donors, which has impacted in many ways on the school system. Of these three aspects, geography is fundamental . In a land area of 587,000 km 2 (Fig. 1), native forest may still cover as little as 15% of Madagascar, and within these forests some 90% of species are endemic. The remaining forests form a broken circle, inland from the periphery: what Bernhard Meier dubbed ''The necklace of pearls'' [Jolly, 1990]. The center of power, however, is the capital, Antananarivo , on the central plateau, almost as far as possible from any forest. People of the plateau are of predominantly Indonesian descent, with a heritage of Indonesian-style intensive paddy-rice farming and the ''involuted,'' hierarchical, social system that tends to arise in any paddy-rice society [Geertz, 1963]. People on the coast, of more African descent, tend to have freer social rules of marriage and divorce, and a tradition of tavy (swidden, slash and burn) agriculture, which requires access to large areas of forest fallow land. Besides the physical distance and the differences of ethnicity, culture, and lifestyle, the modern road system (or lack of it) means that for the nonflying classes travel between different parts of the island is long, painful, and only undertaken when necessary. In short, the forest with its plants and animals is a resource for those who live nearby and a distant frontier for the more influential people who do not. The second problem is the history of the school system. Schools worldwide are caught between the hope of education for all and the constant pressure to concentrate on those who can rise to the next levels of schooling and salary. In Madagascar, this tension has often translated into the language question: should children learn to read in Malagasy, or should they learn French, the passport to a possible white-collar job? Table I presents a brief resumé of past changes in the public education policy in Madagascar. Within a system characterized by changes in governments, goals, and policies, Madagascar's biodiversity was not included as part of the core curriculum in public education [Ratsimbazafy, 2003]. There was, however, a good deal of environmental education about soil, water, and especially the evils of setting bushfires, though this was not directly related to how this knowledge would benefit local lifestyles and conservation , and actual land use. The final constraint is the economy. In 2007, 85% of the population of 19 million people were under the poverty line at $2/day, with a literacy rate of 63% . The Human Development Index, which combines measures of income, literacy, and life expectancy, put Madagascar at 143 among 177 countries in 2007–2008 (30 countries of mainland Africa rank even lower) [UNDP, 2008]. In absolute terms, Madagascar's per capita income in 2007 was $320, which is 143 times less than that of the United States, or calculated in terms of local purchasing power, per capita income is 50 times less than in the United States [World Bank, 2008a] . Sub- Saharan Africa, including Madagascar, has had a 25-year Great Depression—much worse in terms of both income declines and duration than anything that the West went through in the 1930s (Fig. 2). The slump was only partially owing to a policy of socialism and ensuing corruption combined with population growth, 2008a. It was also the result of externally imposed structural adjustment, which led in most African countries to cuts in health and education, as well as to plummeting commodity prices and spiraling debt repayments. Primary teachers' salaries as of 2004 were 4.1 times per capita GDP, compared with a Sub-SaharanFig. 1. Map of Madagascar's terrains, areas of forest loss, and locations of the three case studies presented in this article. Map after EU Joint Research Centre [Achard et al., 2002]. [Lambert, 2004]. An African Development Bank report of 1998 identified low salaries as the most harmful factor for the education system in general in Africa [Lambert, 2004]. The consequence is high teacher absenteeism, of the order of 20% or more, and that the majority of teachers hold second jobs [Lambert, 2004]. Teachers do the best they can with rote learning, extra feepaying lessons after school, and a pupil–teacher ratio in 2004 of approximately 53, although this is a low figure obtained by dividing the total primary school population by the total number of primary school staff [www.childinfo.org/files/ESAR_Madagascar.pdf: UN- ESCO Institute for Statistics]. In this context, education about biodiversity has largely been left to the foreign-funded conservation NGOs. The next section will provide three case studies of such initiatives and analysis: (1) Centre ValBio near Ranomafana National Park, (2) teaching about Hapalemur (the bamboo lemur) at Lake Alaotra, which is Madagascar's chief rice-producing area, and (3) the Ako Project of books, posters, and educational support. The map of Madagascar,Figure 1, indicates the location and terrain of the three case studies described in this article. For each case study, testing procedures of human participants complied fully with the ethics required within the country of Madagascar. Additionally , all research reported in this manuscript adheres to the American Society of Primatologists (ASP) Principles for the Ethical Treatment of Non-Human Primates. With the election of President Ravalomanana in 2002, the Malagasy government began a set of programs targeted to improve education. School fees were eliminated for public primary schools, and a million additional children enrolled. The net enrolment ratio in primary schools rose from 67% in 2001–2002 to 98% in 2004–2005 [World Bank, 2008b]. Many new schools were built, but changes on this scale present huge challenges. In 2008, the Ministry of Education, using an $85 M multi-donor ''Catalytic Fund,'' embarked upon a 5-year plan to massively restructure the teaching curriculum, including an ambitious plan for teaching support. Conservation became a major plank of the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), including building conservation into the new curriculum; as of early 2009, Table II outlines proposed educational reforms. However, the recent change of Madagascar's government in March 2009 has led to violence and the cancelling of most foreign aid, as well as to national economic free-fall. It is unclear if any of the proposed reforms will be carried out. More than ever, the efforts of NGOs will continue to be crucial to conservation education.","doi":"10.1002/ajp.20779","journal":{"name":"American Journal of Primatology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":127}

L. and Jolly A. and Rasamimanana H. and Ratsimbazafy J. and Feistner A. T. and Ravoavy F.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Conservation Education in Madagascar Few Malagasy have ever seen a lemur in the wild; 90% of the population of Madagascar do not live near a forest. The few that do belong to two minorities: people living on the edge of the dwindling forests, and highly educated and dedicated conservationists. This is in spite of the fact that for westerners, Madagascar's fame is its endemic flora and fauna, including what may be more than 100 species of lemurs, many of them newly described [Mittermeier et al., 2008]. Malagasy culture includes many traditional proverbs inspired by domestic animals (cows or chickens) observed in daily life [MINESEB-UNICEF-SNIC, 1985–1988 MINESEBCRESED-UERP, 1998 Programmes Scolaires en Primaire & Au Lycee] and even some about the now extinct hippopotamus, but few about living endemic species, which reflects a general lack of knowledge or even a fear or dislike of these species [Ratsimbazafy, 2003]. Nevertheless, during the last two decades, conservation has become a government policy and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have contributed approximately $38 million in 2008–2009, to ensure preservation of endemic species in Madagascar [Rabenandrasana, 2005; Ratsimbazafy, 2003; Madagascar Environment Program Phase II (PEII)]. Because most Malagasy children are unfamiliar with Madagascar's unique species, it follows that as adults few will have an interest in conserving endangered biodiversity [Ratsimbazafy, 2003] . Typically , children are not taught about native wildlife or the science of conservation in schools. Instead, they are more familiar with giraffes, lions, tigers, and polar bears, animals that do not exist in Madagascar [Ratsimbazafy, 2003]. In fact, a television-watching child in the west knows more about lemurs than most Malagasy children do [Ratsimbazafy, 2003; Jolly, personal observation]. There are three general causes for this, all of them deep-seated. First, is the geography and human population distribution on the island-continent. Second, there is a long history of neglect of biodiversity within the main educational system. Third, Madagascar was the tenth poorest country in the world by the start of the twenty-first century; in fact, the poorest that did not have civil or external wars—so there were few funds for conservation education [World Development Report, 2000/2001. The economic constraints both reflect and exacerbate unequal power between peasants, elites, and foreign donors, which has impacted in many ways on the school system. Of these three aspects, geography is fundamental . In a land area of 587,000 km 2 (Fig. 1), native forest may still cover as little as 15% of Madagascar, and within these forests some 90% of species are endemic. The remaining forests form a broken circle, inland from the periphery: what Bernhard Meier dubbed ''The necklace of pearls'' [Jolly, 1990]. The center of power, however, is the capital, Antananarivo , on the central plateau, almost as far as possible from any forest. People of the plateau are of predominantly Indonesian descent, with a heritage of Indonesian-style intensive paddy-rice farming and the ''involuted,'' hierarchical, social system that tends to arise in any paddy-rice society [Geertz, 1963]. People on the coast, of more African descent, tend to have freer social rules of marriage and divorce, and a tradition of tavy (swidden, slash and burn) agriculture, which requires access to large areas of forest fallow land. Besides the physical distance and the differences of ethnicity, culture, and lifestyle, the modern road system (or lack of it) means that for the nonflying classes travel between different parts of the island is long, painful, and only undertaken when necessary. In short, the forest with its plants and animals is a resource for those who live nearby and a distant frontier for the more influential people who do not. The second problem is the history of the school system. Schools worldwide are caught between the hope of education for all and the constant pressure to concentrate on those who can rise to the next levels of schooling and salary. In Madagascar, this tension has often translated into the language question: should children learn to read in Malagasy, or should they learn French, the passport to a possible white-collar job? Table I presents a brief resumé of past changes in the public education policy in Madagascar. Within a system characterized by changes in governments, goals, and policies, Madagascar's biodiversity was not included as part of the core curriculum in public education [Ratsimbazafy, 2003]. There was, however, a good deal of environmental education about soil, water, and especially the evils of setting bushfires, though this was not directly related to how this knowledge would benefit local lifestyles and conservation , and actual land use. The final constraint is the economy. In 2007, 85% of the population of 19 million people were under the poverty line at $2/day, with a literacy rate of 63% . The Human Development Index, which combines measures of income, literacy, and life expectancy, put Madagascar at 143 among 177 countries in 2007–2008 (30 countries of mainland Africa rank even lower) [UNDP, 2008]. In absolute terms, Madagascar's per capita income in 2007 was $320, which is 143 times less than that of the United States, or calculated in terms of local purchasing power, per capita income is 50 times less than in the United States [World Bank, 2008a] . Sub- Saharan Africa, including Madagascar, has had a 25-year Great Depression—much worse in terms of both income declines and duration than anything that the West went through in the 1930s (Fig. 2). The slump was only partially owing to a policy of socialism and ensuing corruption combined with population growth, 2008a. It was also the result of externally imposed structural adjustment, which led in most African countries to cuts in health and education, as well as to plummeting commodity prices and spiraling debt repayments. Primary teachers' salaries as of 2004 were 4.1 times per capita GDP, compared with a Sub-SaharanFig. 1. Map of Madagascar's terrains, areas of forest loss, and locations of the three case studies presented in this article. Map after EU Joint Research Centre [Achard et al., 2002]. [Lambert, 2004]. An African Development Bank report of 1998 identified low salaries as the most harmful factor for the education system in general in Africa [Lambert, 2004]. The consequence is high teacher absenteeism, of the order of 20% or more, and that the majority of teachers hold second jobs [Lambert, 2004]. Teachers do the best they can with rote learning, extra feepaying lessons after school, and a pupil–teacher ratio in 2004 of approximately 53, although this is a low figure obtained by dividing the total primary school population by the total number of primary school staff [www.childinfo.org/files/ESAR_Madagascar.pdf: UN- ESCO Institute for Statistics]. In this context, education about biodiversity has largely been left to the foreign-funded conservation NGOs.

Agricultural technologies, for example, irrigation, mechanization, enhanced seeds, crop protection and nutrition products contribute to productivity increases on land already cultivated and, therefore, play a role in preventing further land conversion to agriculture. However, such technologies must be adapted and employed within the context of locally appropriate land management strategies that take an integrated approach to achieving agricultural production, rural livelihoods and biodiversity conservation goals. This paper was developed for presentation at a workshop on 'Conservation Technologies for Sustainable Agriculture', held during the 4th, It highlights the potential roles a plant science company can play in addressing the challenge of jointly achieving crop productivity and biodiversity conservation objectives. These relate to activities that integrate biodiversity conservation objectives into technology research and development (R&D) of crop protection products and into land management approaches. Three pilot initiatives developed by Bayer CropScience in Brazil, Guatemala and the UK in collaboration with a variety of local stakeholders illustrate how conservation objectives can be embedded in land management practices that sustainably enhance agricultural productivity and profitability, simultaneously addressing food security and biodiversity conservation challenges. Bayer CropScience, a subsidiary of Bayer AG, is a market leader in the areas of crop protection, non-agricultural pest control, seeds and plant biotechnology.

A policy to protect the grasslands established in 2001 (the Grassland Ban Policy [GBP]), involves four management practices including grazing bans, keeping grasslands fallow, grazing rotations and rearing livestock in sheds. A questionnaire was developed and used to establish attitudes towards and beliefs about the GBP in different sectors (farming households, local officials and extension workers), assess problems with GBP implementation and identify possible solutions. Acceptance of the GBP by farmers varied from 64% in the north to 95% in the northwest region. The responses of both local officials and extension workers indicated that GBP implementation was greater in the central region than in the northwest region. Most farmers changed their livestock production system from grazing to stall feeding after implementation of the GBP, while both farmers and extension workers reported that high input costs were the most serious problem in stall feeding. Incentives need to be provided for sustainable implementation of the GBP by different stakeholders. Improved collaboration among farmers, local officials and extension workers is needed for technology transfer and policy implementation.

{"filename":"Dongol et al. 2002","year":2002,"title":"Capital Formation and Sustainable Community Forestry in Nepal","authors":"Dongol C. M. and Hughey K. F. and Bigsby H. R.","dAbstract":"Introduction In recent years, community participation has been increasingly regarded as a necessary basis for effective sustainable development and for determination of the overall quality of development projects, including forest conservation (UN 1990; Cernea 1992; Narayan 1996). Sustainable development is defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (WCED 1987). Community forestry is one form of participation in managing forests owned by the community. It evolved during the 1980s as a means of both resolving environmental problems associated with deforestation and satisfying the subsistence needs of rural communities. For the purposes of this study, sustainability of community forestry means utilization, development, and conservation of forest resources for continual improvement of the living conditions of subsistence farmers in a given rural community. However, community forestry will not be made sustainable simply by granting responsibilities to local communities. Indeed, community groups, even with self-motivated and active participants, do not in themselves ensure the sustainability of organizations or the achievement of set objectives (UN 1990): various conditions need to be met before such groups are successful in meeting their goals. The experience of participatory initiatives in many Asian countries has shown that the sustainability of community-based organizations depends on a common interest, capital formation, capacity building, grooming activists, and formal organization. The absence of any of these factors casts serious doubts on the long-term viability of a community-based organization because the factors are complementary (IFAD 1997). Whereas many studies have been done on most factors, little attention has been paid to capital formation (Dongol 1999). This study deals with capital formation in order to understand its role in contributing to the sustainability of community forestry in Nepal. Capital is a stock of wealth that can yield goods and services in the future (Robb 1981; Daly 1994). In the present context, capital formation is defined as an accumulation of financial, human, and natural capital. The present study is concerned mostly with the human and financial capital of forest user groups (FUGs). Financial capital is a stock deposited into a community savings account. Human capital consists of the skilled and unskilled manpower and the facilities and infrastructure created in a rural area through the use of the financial resources generated from community forestry. A particular objective of the study was to determine the characteristics of a successful FUG in Nepal. Additional objectives were to determine how the community generates and manages the funds collected for sustainable development and the impact of sustainable development on the forest management regime and rural development (Figure 1). The study argues that capital formation has played a role in drawing local attention to sustainable management of community forests in Nepal.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Source: Mountain Research and Development","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":133}

The analysis is based on data from four CBFM sites in the Philippines. The findings suggest that contract NGOs have varying degrees of effectiveness at delivering services, using and encouraging participatory methods, and helping build the capacity of CBFM groups. Because the CBFM program was new, it focused on relatively more straightforward technical and planning functions. The high number and technical difficulty of deliverables, coupled with lack of experience in resource management on the part of some contract NGOs, may have contributed to relatively lower performance in service delivery activities. Contract Ellen M. Donoghue is Research Social Scientist, USDA Forest Service, Pacific NGOs performed better in the area of participatory methods, reflecting their experience in grassroots and community development. Capacity building performance was as expected, relative to the participatory and service-delivery categories. Capacity building activities require long-term commitment and unique sets of skills, and are therefore challenging for the NGOs to implement. More attention to designing feasible and effective contracts is needed. Because CBFM is a long-term strategy, we recommend greater levels of support to help groups develop collective interests in forest resource management and build the capacity to satisfy programmatic requirements.","doi":"10.1300/J091v17n04_04","journal":{"name":"Journal of Sustainable Forestry","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":134}

P.","dAbstract":"Recent years have seen greater of®cial recognition and support for community-based natural resource management in hillside systems globally. In the Middle Hills of Nepal, this has led to adoption of Community Forestry with communities keen to conserve forest resources through greater control of access to forest resources. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of Community Forestry on agricultural sustainability using Participatory Learning and Action Research (PLAR) methods and soil and compost nutrient analyses to assess the nutrient balance for rainfed and irrigated ®elds. Studies demonstrate a yield dependence on annual nutrient inputs to ®elds, but a remaining positive balance of nutrient inputs. Concerns over soil degradation associated with increasing urea fertilizer dependence highlight the vital role played by organic compost inputs to the soils typi®ed by very low organic carbon concentrations. The ®ndings from two study villages show that Community Forestry has not yet had a major impact (either positive or negative) on farming systems and therefore the majority of rural livelihoods. However, opportunities are recognized that would increase the quantity and quality of compost supply, and consequently crop yields. Increases in natural capital (subcanopy plants) and the increased social capital (provided by Forest User Groups) offer the means through which potential increases to compost materials can be obtained and through which knowledge of the potentials of, and techniques for, improving compost supply could be disseminated. It is such strategies, which go beyond the traditional focus on forests, that will enable Community Forestry in Nepal (which already has many achievements) to realize its full potential in maintaining and improving the livelihoods of the hill farming communities it is intended to assist.","doi":"10.1002/ldr.438","journal":{"name":"Land Degrad.

In the Philippine uplands, indigenous peoples and migrant settlers co-exist, compete over land and forest resources, and shape how managers preserve forests through national parks. This article examines how migrants have claimed lands and changed production and exchange relations among the indigenous Tagbanua to build on and benefit from otherwise coercive park management on Palawan Island, the Philippines. Migrant control over productive resources has influenced who, within each group, could sustain agriculture in the face of the state's dominant conservation narrative — valorizing migrant paddy rice and criminalizing Tagbanua swiddens. Upon settling, migrant farmers used new political and economic strengths to tap into provincial political networks in order to be hired at a national park. As a result, they were able to steer management to support paddy rice at the expense of swidden cultivation. While state conservation policy shapes how national parks impact upon local resource access and use, older political economic inequalities in forest villages build on such policies to influence how management affects the livelihoods of poor households.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":140}

Neo-liberal agendas promoted by government and the transfrontier park derail efforts at decentralizing CBNRM initiatives beyond markets and state control. This paper argues that 'hybrid neoliberal' CBNRM has arisen in private and public sector delivery of devolved conservation and poverty relief projects as 'ter-tiary production' for regional development. As a result, 'CBNRM' projects related to and independent of transfrontier conservation support private sector interests rather than the resource base of rural livelihoods.

Why do state agencies decentralize power, what political patterns unfold, and how do outcomes affect the responses of resource users? This paper explores decentralization reform by investigating the political processes behind the Philippine state's decisions to transfer authority over national parks management to local government units. Drawing on a case of devolved management at Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Palawan Island, we examine how political motives situated at different institutional scales affect the broader process of decentralization, the structure of management institutions, and overall livelihood security. We demonstrate how power struggles between the Philippine state and City Government of Palawan over the right to manage the national park have impacted the livelihood support offered by community-based conservation. We conclude that decentralization may offer empowering results when upper-level policies and political networks tie into sufficiently organized institutions at the local level.","doi":"10.1016/j.polgeo.2006.07.005","journal":null,"aid":141}

However, as with other market-based policies, the expeditious delivery of REDD could bypass critical analysis of potential interactions with national tenure regimes, customary property rights, and local livelihoods. Drawing on the case of Palawan Island—a forested frontier island in the Philippines—we examine how nascent REDD policies can articulate with state sanctioned tenure, customary tenure, and forest uses in changing livelihood contexts. This paper draws on research among Tagbanua and Pala'wan people to illustrate how complex and changing tenure structures, commodity markets and livelihood dynamics may influence how REDD plus interventions affect indigenous customary lands and forest use. We argue that the ability of indigenous forest users to maintain stored carbon and improve livelihoods is contingent upon the 'socio-material' form of carbon—a commodity defined in relation to the resources and social processes of which it is part.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":143}

Because mature trees are very large (up to 50 m in height and 3 m in diameter), can live hundreds of years (Vieira et al. 2005), occur at relatively high densities, and have a wide geographic distribution, this species provides important local and landscape-level ecological structural and functional roles. When the large, woody fruits fall during the rainy season, retaining the approximately 25 seeds (nuts), harvesters gather and break them open in the forest (Wadt et al. 2008). Although one meta-analysis suggested that persistent harvests over decades explain insufficient juvenile recruitment (Peres et al. 2003), more recent findings in our study region found healthy regeneration levels under diverse harvest intensities (Zuidema and Boot 2002; Wadt et al. 2008 ). In Central Amazonia, Scoles and Gribel (2012) conclude that harvest restrictions to improve regeneration are of little to no value. Government agencies and NGOs in Western Amazonia have outlined a series of ''best management practices'' to support Brazil nut production (Table 1). Rooted in forestry legislation, certification standards, research on Brazil nut ecology and management , and producer knowledge, these practices can be categorized as: (1) preharvest practices, such as mapping adult trees and developing a management plan; (2) silvicultural practices, including those that promote regeneration (e.g., enrichment planting) and enhance fruit yield (e.g., vine cutting); and (3) harvest and postharvest practices, such as nut drying. These practices have been disseminated via regional extension literature (Wadt et al. 2005; Cardó 2000) and widely promoted through cooperatives and producer meetings.","doi":"10.1080/08941920.2013.840022","journal":{"name":"An International Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":878}

E. and Wollenberg E.","dAbstract":"Introduction 191 The Asian context of devolution policy has been distinctive for its large numbers of people living in and depending on forests, extensive state ownership of forestlands , highly organized and centralized forest bureaucracies, and two-decade history of devolution policies. Struggles between states and their citizens over forest management issues have often been intense, generating constant pressure for reforms . The cases in this issue focus on the countries with the longest, and most complex, histories of formal devolution policies: Nepal, India, China, and the Philippines. These cases identify four clear patterns in devolution policy history. First, devolution policies emerged in response to centralist ideologies, institutional structures, and social relations that dominated governments during much of this century. Government officials often controlled reforms, however, and so these older ideas, structures, and relations greatly influenced the content and implementation of devolution policies. The cases by Yam Malla and Francisco Magno presented in this issue, for example, suggest that when foresters cling to a belief in the superiority of scientific management, when they remain accountable to bureaucratic superiors, and when they maintain ties to local elite, devolution policies leave the poorest forest users worse off than before. Their analyses suggest the need for further reform that weakens or eliminates these historical holdovers. Second, historical analysis reminds us that forest management by local people was interrupted and distorted by years of centralized control. The idea that devolution can recreate the precolonial days of community-based forest management, where it existed, is untenable. As the papers by Liu Dachang and Ramachandra Guha indicate, many forests have been drastically altered, now dominated by evergreen rather than broadleaf trees, depopulated of wild animals, with plant species better suited to international markets than local uses. The contexts of forest management have changed with new tenurial regimes, technologies, and new pressures for use. Capacities that existed in the past may not have kept pace with these changes. While some local forest management institutions have survived, others are now gone, with little local memory of how they functioned, or even interest in recreating them. This suggests that devolution requires in some places the continued involvement of the state in supporting local management. States may struggle with their capacity and legitimacy to play such a role, as all four papers suggest. The rise of forest-based social movements and nongovernmental organizations (NCOS) in recent decades provides states with potential partners for the task, though the persistence of elite/subordinate relations at local levels makes every partner potentially problematic, as Malla points out. Third, forest users themselves have promoted more democratic, devolved forest management by mobilizing on their own or, more often, in alliance with other civil society groups and progressive government officials. These alliances have been around for some time, as Guha makes clear, and have influenced the development of existing devolution policies in most cases. Their influence thus far has been limited relative to that of holdover officials and local elites. New discourses about democracy, indigenous rights and conservation, however, will encourage further, more democratic reforms.' Finally, historical analysis suggests the importance of learning from the outcomes of past policy interventions in a more systematic and collaborative manner. Policymakers have adapted devolution policies over the years in response to new political climates and management opportunities and concerns. The increasing attention to biodiversity conservation and protected area managementare examples (see Liu, Malla, and Cuha). Where policy has been treated in an experimental fashion, as in southern China, and where there has been broader participation in the policy evaluation and reformulation process, as in some places in India and the Philippines, policy improvements have been more dramatic.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":145}

Ukraine's forest sector is in transition from planned socialist to market economy. We evaluated the role of the traditional village system, which was successful for centuries for achieving both common economic as well as these new dimensions of sustainable forest management in Ukraine's Carpathian Mountains. We used the Skole district as a case study that represents one of the most forested areas in Ukraine, and an integral part of Boiko people's ethnographic area. The village is a traditional social–ecological system defined by the traditional land use of pre-industrial cultural landscapes, and a spatial structure with land use zones satisfying different needs. Using documents on regional environmental history, analysis of socioeconomic statistics, and interviews with local land users, we evaluated the extent to which the traditional village system supports socio-cultural dimensions of sustainable forest management. Our review of environmental history indicates that after different phases of cultural landscape development during several 100 years, the traditional village system is still a basic unit of the Skole district's forest landscapes. However, data and interviews show that the traditional village system is endangered. Making use of the total economic value of forest landscape resources, including wood and non-wood products and services based on cultural values and biodiversity, is an urgent task. Support of traditional village socio-cultural functions and land use systems including fields, wooded grasslands and forests should be milestones in a regional program of sustainable forest management. Traditional village system zoning and land use systems would be good indicators of sustainable forest landscapes. #","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2007.04.003","journal":null,"aid":147}

Also, the majority of people in the researched areas are illiterate and antagonistic to the idea of conserving the area's rich diversity. This paper evaluates the relationships between donor agencies and the local people concerning participation in biodiversity conservation in the national parks. It also highlights the problems and the criteria required for effective local participation. The researchers sampled a total of 100 respondents from the Akampka Local Government Area of Cross River State, a forest community in the Cross River National Park. Twentyfive persons were randomly selected from each of the four communities selected for the study, and key informant interviews and focus group discussions were used to elicit data. Results show that the local people are not properly involved in the conservation of their forest, and were not benefiting from the conservation project. This has created problems with regard to the government's position of total conservation and community living conditions. Recommendations are made on how to integrate public participation into conservation projects. Keywords: conservation, biodiversity, participation, national parks, community livelihoods UBLIC PARTICIPATION IS a nebulous term that has been subjected to a series of diagnoses and 'social experimentations'. According to Kiss (1990) , the answer to 'what is public participation' is full of innocuous euphemisms such as 'selfhelp' or 'public involvement'. Others tend to exaggerate the meaning to include misleading terms such as 'absolute control' – a thing not practically feasible in a real situation. Fundamentally, public participation, variously referred to as stakeholder involvement, citizen involvement, local or community participation, is an attempt to involve the various stakeholder communities (publics) in the decision-making process, so that wider acceptability and support for the particular action can be obtained (WWF, 1991). According to Paul (1987) , public participation is the process 'in which people act in groups to influence the direction and outcome of development programmes that will affect them'. Participation may be viewed in terms of the deliberate action of the people and government to respond jointly to the formulation, planning and implementation of a strategy to satisfy a particular need. Brown and Wyckoff-Baird (1992) provide a broader definition by stating that participation 'may best be defined as a continuum, from limited input into decision making and control, to extensive input into decision making, and ultimately stewardship of the resources'. In an earlier but related development, Glass (1979) saw public participation generally as creating a forum for the public to take part in government decisions or planning processes of any type (Agrawal and Redford, 2006). Nevertheless, irrespective of the many views on what constitutes public participation, it is worth stressing that, in the past, public participation was often seen as an end in itself: something that needed no justification other than its congruence with democracy – the Greek stronghold. However, within the framework of the democratization process, public participation is handicapped by the fact that it is devoid of structural orientation in order to give the desired results. This one-dimensional view has recently been replaced by a more analyzed and intricate conceptualization, which sees public participation as means to other ends and not just an end in itself (Renard, 1992). Chambers (1995 Chambers ( , 2005) gave a clearer definition, seeing public participation as an attempt by a development partner to make a broader consultation and involve the rural communities where projects are to be situated. This means involving local people in the decision making, planning process and implementation of any intervention project in any targeted area. Participation here means a change in management paradigm from the conventional top-down approach to a broader consultation, and involvement of the intended beneficiaries or target group, mostly the various stakeholders, women, children and disadvantaged groups (Chambers, 1992; Seitz, 2000). Nigeria is blessed with large areas of tropical rainforest and is a very rich biodiversity hotspot. The areas along Lagos, Rivers, Ondo Ogun, Akwa Ibom and Cross River State in the tropical region are very rich in biodiversity, but owing to the activities of farmers and the Western Metal Construction Company (WEMCO), most of this biodiversity hotspot has been depleted to secondary forest. Cross River, and indeed Akamkpa, is the one region in the whole of Nigeria that is keeping the closed-canopy forest intact. Of the 5% of tropical rainforest left in the country, Cross River State alone has 4.5%, which is very rich in both flora and fauna, and also a home to most world endemic species. This research was located in Akamkpa Local Government Area, where the headquarters of the Cross River National Park is situated. As already mentioned, this is one of the areas where the International Union for the Conservation Nature (IUCN), the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) and the Nigeria Park Service Commission are carrying out integrated activities for the conservation of biodiversity. Conventionally, Nigeria used a top-down management approach for all its forest resources, but owing to the failure of this method to achieve a better benefits for communities and the government, it has been recognized that community participation will be a better option, as the communities where these resources are located have a great knowledge of their environment and had always used it to conserve the forest. This indigenous or traditional knowledge can now be married to modern conservation techniques whereby the people within the confines of these resources are allowed to drive the process of conservation. This method brings the different stakeholders to the table for decision making, planning and implementation (Schwartzman et al, 2000). The project for which public participation is sought is the Cross River Nation Park project. The park was gazetted as a Game Reserve and promoted to the status of National Park by a federal government decree in 1991. This increased the number of national parks in the country to nine. This park is located within three local government areas, Akampa, Etung and Boki. It is divided into two noncontiguous divisions: the Oban axis, with an area of 3000 km 2 in Akamkpa, and the Boshi-Okwangho division in Boki/Etung, with an area of 1000 km 2 . It is home to most endemic wildlife and biodiversity species, hence the activities and investment from WWF, IUCN, NCF and other donor agencies. The decision to make this forest a conservation zone became vital because of the activities of illegal lumber workers, local farmers and the Western Metal Construction Company (WEMCO), who were deforesting other parts of the country, such as the forests of Ogun, Ondo, Lagos and other areas along the Atlantic coast. Cross River forest became the only surviving tropical rainforest with an intact closed canopy, hence the need to protect it from complete extinction , as it is home to most endemic and endangered wildlife species in the world. However, the establishment of this park undermined the abilities and capacities of the forest communities. They were left completely in the dark and were not consulted about the decision, which deprived them of the forest resources where they have traditionally derived their livelihoods. Public participation in biodiversity conservation makes for an understanding between the proponents of the conservation projects and the local forest communities. The attempts at biodiversity conservation in Nigeria have tended to rely on strict protection through the establishment of national parks and game reserves , as found in Gashaka-Gumti, Okomu, Kainji, Lake Chad and Cross River, among others. The inhabitants of these reserved areas, however, often bear the costs and rarely receive the benefits associated with nearby reserved areas, and hence have usually had little vested interest in protecting the biological resources of these protected areas. The effect has been that local people's attitudes have often been biased against the reserved areas. Where the management of a reserved area is weak, population pressures, abject poverty and unsustainable land use practices outside the reserved areas and their support zones can cause people to engage in illegal and destructive encroachment (Wells and Brandon, 1992). Incidents of this nature are bound to rise with increasing demands for resources, as evidenced in the Cross River National Park, were illegal poaching and logging take place.","doi":"10.3152/146155109X479431","journal":null,"aid":150}

Introduction: forests and REDD While the rate of tropical deforestation is slowing, losses of biodiversity and biomass continue to mount (FAO, 2011) and deforestation and forest degradation remain one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Overall, about 20% of annual carbon output originates from clearing or degrading forests (IPCC, 2007). Recognizing the role of forests as a carbon sink is essential to mitigating global climate change (Stern, 2006). REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is a mechanism to implement the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). REDD+ is used as a broad term that encompasses the range of forest conservation and reforestation options and financing mechanisms being negotiated at the global and national levels to reduce deforestation and forest degradation and improve forest carbon stocks in order to mitigate climate change (Peskett et al., 2008). REDD payments may come from national funds set up by multilateral institutions, donor countries or NGOs, or from emerging global carbon credit markets (Skutsch and McCall, 2011 ). The United Nations REDD Programme (UN- REDD) predicts that total financial flows from national funds and carbon markets could reach US$30 billion a year (UNREDD, 2011). REDD aims to provide performance-based payments to forest landholders in developing countries who e n v i r o n m e n t a l s c i e n c e & p o l i c y 3 5 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 9 8 – 1 0 8 a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: the future and lack of trust in governance regimes. Long-term community priorities were in generating work, providing educational opportunities for their children, and improving the quality of their forest. Conflict—within the community, with local loggers and with the recently established regional conservation area—was a prevalent theme. A REDD design that recognizes communities as active participants in global and national climate management and pays attention to local narratives will more likely generate the multiple benefits of healthy forests, strong communities and, ultimately, global climate change mitigation. # 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. conserve their forests (Wunder, 2009). It involves establishing a baseline for past emissions, generating business-as-usual scenarios to predict future pathways of the emission curve, verifying tenure and coordinating with national governments to develop national REDD plans, and creating monitoring, reporting and verification schemes for negotiated emission reduction (Angelsen, 2009). Contrasting with the global blueprint of REDD are local forest communities. Approximately 22% of the world's tropical forests are owned or managed by communities (White and Martin, 2002), and forests are home to some of the most marginalized and poor people in the world (Sunderlin et al., 2005). The participation of communities in REDD is considered by many to be necessary for the mechanism to succeed in reducing overall carbon emissions (Skutsch and McCall, 2011). While some REDD designers see the effort as primarily an environmental initiative with ''no-harm'' to communities, pro-poor advocates have voiced concerns that REDD could negatively impact upon forest communities and indigenous groups and that too few safeguards exist to protect their interests (Lovera, 2008; Glü ck et al., 2010; Peskett et al., 2008). Weak tenure regimes could lead to displacement of communities if more powerful local actors (e.g. ranchers, loggers, government, and corporations) assume rights over their forest (Wollenberg and Springate-Baginski, 2009; Lovera, 2008). Communities are internally diverse in their histories, internal organization, livelihood strategies and networks, and there are risks of resource appropriation and elite capture within communities (Peskett et al., 2008; Cano, 2012). Thus, nominally apolitical incentives could create new tensions and incentives to degrade forests (Lovera, 2008). Pro-poor advocates argue that if REDD simply provides compensation for lost livelihoods by paying people what they would have received from a deforestation activity like logging, REDD would become a ''poverty reproducer'' (Wollenberg and Springate-Baginski, 2009). Instead, REDD should provide additional income, alternative livelihoods, land tenure security and local resource rights for communities (Skutsch and McCall, 2011; Wollenberg and Springate-Baginski, 2009; Peskett et al., 2008). The REDD framework must also provide long-term pathways out of poverty and the pressure for reducing deforestation should not fall solely on the communities themselves (Wollenberg and Springate-Baginski, 2009). Therefore, context-specific links between poverty, development and deforestation must be considered carefully in the underlying assumptions, design and implementation of REDD (Peskett et al., 2008). At the heart of this controversy lies a governance limitation of international environmental regimes such as UNFCCC and derived instruments like REDD, and how much space they leave for implementation at national level. This paper hypothesizes that while current international climate change policy mechanisms capture the highly diverse perceptions and aspirations of local forest dwellers, indigenous peoples and other forest based societies, there is a huge gap at the national level where complex interests, environmental priorities and poor governance practices are concerns for unpredictable outcomes from internationally agreed climate change policies. We examine two indigenous communities in Peru to reveal pluralistic voices and much ambiguity, and contrast those perspectives with global and national narratives that led to the arrival of REDD mechanisms in remote corners of the Peruvian Amazon. By signaling those contrasts and the possible negative implications they may have for the implementations of REDD programs and by suggesting some possible ways forward we aim to contribute to the widely signaled disparity between climate change narratives in global environmental governance and local on the ground realities where global governance has direct impacts. In the following section, we outline climate change in both global governance and Peru's domestic governance and how this incorporates the voice of indigenous people. Section 3 introduces our field methods. Section 4 presents the results of our work in indigenous communities in the Amazon Basin of Peru. We then use the results of our field work for an alternative framing of REDD, which we compare with the global narratives (Section 5). In the final section, we reflect on how the political process of climate change needs to connect with the local realities that we have analyzed in this paper.","doi":"10.1016/j.envsci.2012.12.013","journal":null,"aid":155}

Mahseer fishes of the genus Tor are 'iconic species' in Indian rivers, representing 'flagship' species for conservation purposes but with additional exploitable, cultural and economic values. Conservation action is required to address their vulnerability to numerous pressures on multiple habitats, and connections between them, across the extended aquatic ecosystems supporting different life stages. 2. Recreational angling for mahseer, along with associated wildlife and cultural tourism, is a growth industry dependent upon healthy river ecosystems. 3. A cyclic, ecosystem-based model in which local people can benefit economically from sustainable mahseer exploitation through catch-and-release fisheries can form a basis for conservation of both mahseer and the wider river ecosystem. 4. Experience on the Western Ramganga River in the vicinity of the town of Bikhyasen, Uttarakhand State (in the Himalayas in northern India), demonstrates the importance of involving local people in the benefits associated with angling, wildlife and cultural tourism. This creates local incentives for river protection, and may be the most effective means for preventing destructive over-exploitation in poor rural communities. 5. Recognition of this value and its recirculation to local people can form the basis for a 'paying for ecosystems services' (PES) market. This will benefit river ecosystems, local people, tour operators and visiting anglers, provided that local people benefit to a greater extent than through the killing of fish for non-renewable consumption or sale. 6. This is the basis for a potentially transferable model which may support regional development through involving local people in markets for iconic species.","doi":"10.1002/aqc.1159","journal":null,"aid":156}

CBNRM therefore requires strong investments in capacity development of local institutions and governance structures. CBNRM has come under strong criticism for its failures to deliver real benefits to communities. In this paper we explore the reasons for the frequent failure of CBNRM. We postulate that good governance buffers CBNRM against unexpected change, notably conflicts, especially in the early stages when income generation, infrastructure development and capacity development have not yet taken place. We assess the key characteristics of CBNRM governance systems that could perform this buffering function, using case study examples from Macubeni, Nqabara, Makuleke and Richtersveld to support our propositions. In our case studies, 11 strategies have been used to increase the incidence of success of CBNRM: understand and describe the social-ecological system; establish and communicate a clear vision; build on local organizations; plan ahead; create rules for resource use and enforce them; communicate the vision, plan and rules; develop management capacity; finance the initial stages of the initiative; work within available legal frameworks; monitor and learn all the time; and create lasting incentives. Despite these strategies there are, however, a number of obstinate implementation challenges, related to governance shortcomings and external factors which management cannot control. We therefore propose seven additional strategies to promote good governance in CBNRM: 1. Develop knowledge networks that draw on the experience and wisdom of a wide range of key individuals. 2. Establish formalised decision-making structures (e.g. multi-level project steering committees) with clear constitutions and codes of conduct. 3. Clearly define and legitimise conflict resolution procedures. 4. Ensure acceptance of the governance structure by community members. 5. Obtain formal commitment to well-defined roles and responsibilities by key individuals. 6.

Using a case study of the conversion of mangrove ecosystems to shrimp aquaculture, this article describes an effort to develop a transdisciplinary, transinstitutional approach to conservation that simultaneously trains future generations of environmental problem solvers. We worked in close collaboration with academics, non-government organizations, local government and local communities to organize a workshop in Puerto Princesa, Palawan, Philip-pines. The primary objectives of the workshop were to: (1) train participants in the basic principles of ecological economics and its goals of sustainable scale, just distribution and efficient allocation; (2) learn from local community stakeholders and participating scientists about the problems surrounding conversion of mangrove ecosystems to shrimp aquaculture; (3) draw on the skills and knowledge of all participants to develop potential solutions to the problem; and (4) communicate results to those with the power and authority to act on them. We found that the economic and ecological benefits of intact mangroves outweigh the returns to aquaculture. Perversely, however, private property rights to mangrove ecosystems favor inefficient, unjust and unsustainable allocation of the resource—a tragedy of the non-commons. We presented the workshop results to the press and local government, which shut down the aquaculture ponds to conserve the threatened ecosystem. Effective communication to appropriate audiences was essential for transforming research into action. Our approach is promising and can be readily applied to conservation research and advocacy projects worldwide, but should be improved through adaptive management—prac-titioners must continually build on those elements that work and discard or improve those that fail.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-009-9379-4","journal":null,"aid":163}

We studied human–elephant conflict in two areas with contrasting scenarios of landuse and conflict, Kahalle and Yala. Kahalle was developed and settled under the Mahaweli irrigation project and the main agricultural practice was irrigated agriculture, with two annual growing seasons. The area was a mosaic of settlements, agriculture, and small forest patches with ill defined human-and elephant-use areas. Elephants ranged within the habitat mosaic year round, occupying remnant forest patches and raiding adjacent crops at night. In contrast, Yala was dominated by a large protected area complex, and the main agricultural methods were slash-and-burn agriculture and rain-fed paddy cultivation. Human-and elephant-use areas were well defined and segregated. The protected area provided elephants with a refuge and food during the rainy season, when the single annual crop was grown. During the dry season, elephants moved into slash-and-burn areas and utilized leftover crops and pioneer vegetation in fallow fields. The landuse pattern and agricultural practices in Yala facilitated coexistence , whereas that in Kahalle led to year round conflict. We suggest that areas managed according to traditional landuse practices should be part of an elephant conservation strategy, where people and elephants have to share resources.","doi":"10.1007/s10531-004-0216-z","journal":null,"aid":166}

However, the success of PAs in promoting biodiversity conservation depends on their integration to local and regional contexts, reducing and mitigating human impacts originating from buffer zones. Community perceptions affect interactions between residents and PAs, and thereby conservation effectiveness. Research at Tocantins state (northern Brazilian Cerrado), aimed to analyse local community perceptions of four PAs, discussing how different factors may influence these. Perceptions were assessed through standardized interviews applied to PA employees and 275 local inhabitants. There was modest community participation in PA establishment and management. Residents were aware of the PAs' existence, but were unfamiliar with their goals. Length of residency and occupation of inhabitants influenced their PA perceptions, shaping different people-park relations in each of the four studied PAs. Involvement of local residents in PA planning and management represents a central strategy to strengthen local support for PAs over the long term. In those areas that still have settlements inside their boundaries, community relocation should follow a careful participatory process to avoid significant changes in local perceptions and attitudes towards these PAs, crucial for conserving Brazilian biodiversity.

Taking an actor-oriented research approach, this paper probes beneath the surface patterns to analyse the complex socio-political mechanisms at work in the negotiating arena represented by public participation in project planning. The discussion is based on a case study of community involvement in the planning of protected areas in Belize. Detailed analysis of the power relations and tactical interactions between different actors in the negotiating arenas revealed that planner/community relations in the case study were dominated by a process identified as 'containment'. Containment refers to a strategic management of public involvement by the planning agencies, and it hinged on three fundamental social actions: avoidance of conflict; exclusion of dissent; and control over knowledge and procedure. Actions by local stakeholders that served to undermine containment constitute 'counter-containment'. The paper discusses these mechanisms in depth, before developing a comparative analytical framework of containment and counter-containment to help explain disparities in planning progress between different sites.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"The Geographical Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":168}

Related to this question are concerns about the temporal sustainability of PES: what happens when payments cease and whether a 'no pay, no care' environmental ethic is fostered. I present empirical research from a case study in western Uganda, where forest-adjacent communities are paid in exchange for planting trees on private lands, for carbon sequestration. The study demonstrates the range of values people have for trees in the landscape and the range of motivations for participating in PES schemes. However, the analysis shows that payments are clearly the main motivation for involvement, except in one area where people are more motivated by aesthetic and existence values for trees. Given the widespread importance of money in motivating involvement, I investigate the profitability of participation over time. This profitability analysis, in combination with qualitative data on perceptions of, and plans for, the future, contributes to understanding the temporal sustainability of PES. I draw on various strands of evidence to argue that the way participants prioritize payments may constitute a threat to the long-term maintenance of PES activities, particularly in situations such as in this case study, in which there is a mismatch between payments and contract length.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605311001384","journal":null,"aid":169}

Neoliberal Conservation and the Evasion of Inequality","authors":"Fletcher R.","dAbstract":"Recently, a number of prominent conservationists have declared the last quarter century of global efforts to unite conservation and development through so-called integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) an overwhelming failure, asserting that there are likely to be irreconcilable trade-offs between environmental preservation and enhancing human well-being that future policy will have to take into account. I suggest, however, that such trade-offs may be less an inherent feature of the world than an artefact of the neoliberal governance model upon which the global conservation movement increasingly relies, as embodied in the ICDP approach. In eschewing questions of resource redistribution and instead depending on economic growth to address social inequality, neoliberal conservation strategies often paradoxically force into opposition the very conservation and development interests they ostensibly seek to reconcile. This thesis is illustrated through discussion of Costa Rica's Osa Peninsula, a celebrated biodiversity hotspot where conservation interventions increasingly emphasize neoliberal market mechanisms designed to incentivize preservation by demonstrating the economic value of in situ natural resources.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-7660.2011.01751.x","journal":null,"aid":171}

Introduction A multitude of reports on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) have appeared in the socioeconomic literature. Commercialization of NTFPs has been considered a significant means of developing sustainable tropical forest resources so that forest conservation is promoted while simultaneously supporting rural livelihoods (Hegde and Enters, 2000; Dovie, 2003; Bhattacharya and Hayat, 2004; Belcher et al., 2005; Belcher and Schreckenberg, 2007; Kusters et al., 2006; Newton et al., 2006; Jones and Lynch, 2007). A number of factors may influence the extraction and commercialization of NTFPs, as well as the contribution of NTFPs to local livelihoods ( Bista and Webb, 2006; Nygren et al., 2006). Ecological factors affect the variability and economic value of NTFPs in different habitats. A report indicated that in eastern Brazil, 2.7 times more medicinal plant species were extracted by local healers from secondary habitats than from primary habitats (Voeks, 1996). Commercial collection of NTFPs often was correlated with household characteristics, such as the labor index (namely, the dependency ratio, which is the ratio of labour to household size) and the female labor force participation rate (Quang and Anh, 2006 ). There is a strong gender division of labour and specialization by age for gathering NTFPs. Women played a more important role in NTFPs extraction and value, then followed by men and children (Misra and Dash, 2000; Lawrence et al., 2005). Commercial gathering is often dominated by men, whereas subsistence gathering is almost exclusively the task of women (Wickramasinghe et al., 1996). Economic status of different villages/households may also influence the gathering and consuming of NTFPs. Supporting evidence proved that poorer villages and household groups were more dependent on NTFPs than other groups (Adhikari et al., 2004; Quang and Anh, 2006; Shackleton and Shackleton, 2006). Furthermore, market demand, as well as policy, had impacts on the extraction of NTFPs (Larsen et al., 2000; Shanley et al., 2002; Bista and Webb, 2006). However, both between neighboring communities and within communities, forest dwellers tend to demonstrate different incomegenerating patterns (Barham et al., 1999; Coomes and Burt, 2001; Mahapatra et al., 2005; Shackleton and Shackleton, 2006; Mamo et al., 2007). For example, NTFPs sale ranked as the most important source of cash income for 30% of women interviewed, and either second-or third-most important for the remainder of a highland community in Mexico (). Similarly, 30% of the households regarded NTFPs income-generation as primary source (N50% of household income) while 61% of the households regarded NTFPs income generating as second source and 9% of the households did not collect any NTFPs for marketing in a village of Sri Lanka. The area of agricultural land, especially paddy rice fields, shows a negative relationship to commercial gathering of NTFPs, which indicated a certain dichotomy between having sufficient agricultural land and relying more on the forest (Wickramasinghe et al., 1996). The role of NTFPs in household livelihoods in subsistence agroecosystems around the world, especially in relation to their role in tropical developing countries, has been researched with respect to consumption (especially food security) and income generation (Apasamay, 1993; Reddy and Chakravarty, 1999; Bahuguna, 2000; LacunaRichman, 2002; Shackleton et al., 2002; Shaanker et al., 2004; Odebode, 2005; Delang, 2006). Of rural households in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in southern India, NTFPs contribute between 15% and 50% of the annual per capita income (Narendran et al., 2001). In far western Nepal, 39% of the economically active population in 12 villages of the Baitadi district collected a total of 24 NTFPs from 23 species, which contributed up to 90% of the total household income (Bista and Webb, 2006). Wild food plants, non-market NTFPs, remain a preferred alternative to commercial food crops because gathering wild food plants is a much more efficient use of time than engaging in the market economy in order to purchase commercial food crops (Delang, 2006). Commercialization of subsistence resources and the substitution of commercial crops for subsistence crops provided a pull factor that encouraged farmers to engage in new and different forms of commercial agriculture (Rerkasem and Rerkasem, 1995; Fox and Vogler, 2005). Thus, what kind of role that NTFPs could play in the process of the shifting from a subsistence agroecosystem to a cash–crop dominated system was totally under explored. The spread of small-scale commercial tea cultivation plants has transformed the economy around Sinharaja in Sri Lanka, and led to a decline in the role of NTFPs in the household economy (Senaratne et al., 2003). NTFPs collection allows households with less agricultural land to reach comparable levels of income to households with more agricultural land (Wickramasinghe et al., 1996). Furthermore, NTFPs were regarded as poverty avoidance, filling gaps during periods of low income, and functioning as a safety net and natural insurance (Pattanayak and Sills, 2001; Paumgarten, 2005). Xishuangbanna in Yunnan, China, is one of the biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities (Myers et al., 2000). Xishuangbanna has been inhabited by such ethnic groups as Jinuo, Ahka and Yao, etc. who are traditionally forest dwellers. Most forest dwellers collect NTFPs for both subsistence and trade in order to mitigate risks as well as to diversify their income sources. Often, NTFPs were important sources of cash income for the local people. In the past 40 years, especially within the past two decades, rubber plantations have greatly displaced the traditional swidden–fallow agroecosystems (Fu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2006). By greatly extending the distance between the forest and residence place, large-scale rubber plantations may decrease accessibility to the natural forests where NTFPs are produced and thus decrease the people's dependence on NTFPs. Only the villagers living near national nature reserves may become more dependent on NTFPs. The much higher return for labor from rubber plantations may be an incentive for local people to give up their gathering and collecting activities in the forest. A certain degree of dependence on NTFPs may motivate local people to preserve a certain amount of natural forest, which is the critical point in stopping the biodiversity meltdown in this area. As study sites for the United Nations University Project on People, Land Management and Environmental Change, we choose to study Daka and Baka, which represent different stages in the shift from a subsistence agroecosystem to a rubber plantation-dominated system, and which have different forest access, market access, land allocation, labor availability and so on. The objective of the study is to understand how the traditional practices of collecting NTFPs respond to the shift of an agroecosystem from subsistence to market-oriented system.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2008.08.003","journal":null,"aid":176}

Two critical issues are to what extent these factors play a role, and how to enhance local adaptation through government support. We investigated these issues through a case study of two pastoral communities on the Tibetan Plateau in China employing an analytical framework to understand local climate adaptation processes. We concluded that LEK and community-based institutions improve adaptation outcomes for Tibetan pastoralists through shaping and mobilizing resource availability to reduce risks. Higher-level institutions and policies contribute by providing resources from outside communities. There are dynamic interrelationships among these factors that can lead to support, conflict, and fragmentation. Government policy could enhance local adaptation through improvement of supportive relationships among these factors. While central government policies allow only limited room for overt integration of local knowledge/ institutions, local governments often have some flexibility to buffer conflicts. In addition, government policies to support market-based economic development have greatly benefited adaptation outcomes for pastoralists. Overall, in China, there are still questions over how to create innovative institutions that blend LEK and community-based institutions with government policy making.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Environmental Management","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":177}

While large areas of forestlands were designated as national forest reserves, many forests were actually converted into farmlands. This article focuses on the institutional and administrative aspects of the national forest reserve system, the core institution of forest conservation in Thailand, and examines the institutional structure, historical process mostly since the 񮽙񮽙񮽙񮽙s, and procedures of the national forest reserve system and related policies at both in national and local levels. The national forest reserve system institutionally lacked sufficient mechanisms for enforcement and, because local people's land use was not investigated in advance, the contradiction arose that large numbers of people resided and cultivated land in national forest reserves. While occasionally policies to give cultivation rights to these people were carried out, designation of national forest reserves continued without any structural amendments, and the contradiction was perpetuated. In the procedures of forest protection units, the sole organ for on-the-spot policing, breaches were sometimes overlooked in order to balance the regulations and actual situation of the local people's livelihood. Forest officers are basically faithful to their tasks, even though they know the system itself substantially fails to function. But they also behave in realistic and flexible ways in applying principles that are far from appropriate to the actual situations they encounter. Institutionalization and activation of such an unrealistic system can also be interpreted as creating a wide range of discretion, which has enabled realistic forest conservation to be carried out as far as possible in the prevailing social or political climate without much friction. In order to argue for a suitable forest conservation system, this point must be taken into consideration.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":178}

The studies were conducted in Vientiane, central Lao PDR, and indicate gaps between the expected goals of land reform and actual practice. The study also shows the varying impacts of the allocation policy on local resource use and household livelihoods in different villages.

D.","dAbstract":"Conflict between wildlife and people can erode local support for conservation. Wildlife-based benefits are intended to offset costs and encourage tolerance or stewardship, but where the linkage between benefits and wildlife is not understood, benefits may be ineffective at bolstering conservation. In Laikipia, Kenya, wildlife and areas devoted to wildlife are on the increase, but most residents still suffer losses to wildlife and derive minimal benefits. The elephant situation is particularly problematic because elephants may compete with livestock for resources, raid people's crops, and chase and kill livestock and people. Although most unprotected elephant range in East Africa is in semi-arid rangelands occupied by pastoralists, previous research has emphasized agricultural, not pastoral or agri-pastoral conflicts. Between 1999 and 2002, interviews were conducted in Laikipia District to examine whether pastoralists also experience conflict, and to determine whether wildlife conservation provided appreciable benefits to residents, or fostered pro-conservation attitudes among residents. Three properties, Endana, Koija and Mpala, were selected to include the two primary land uses in Laikipia (livestock and agriculture) and two levels of wildlife-based benefits (indirect benefits and direct benefits from a locally-owned tourism operation). People were negative about many aspects of local wildlife conservation, especially animals that raided crops or were dangerous. Fundamental differences in attitudes were attributable to primary land use; within ethnic groups, people practising agriculture were less tolerant of elephants than people practising pastoralism. Despite evidence that elephants may compete with livestock for forage, ecological competition was not a primary concern among cattle-keeping people. In communities that received indirect benefits from tourism or wildlife, the connection between wildlife and employment or aid in kind was usually overlooked. Unlike elsewhere in Africa, education and wealth did not correlate with positive attitudes towards wildlife because the tourism programme was improving the situation and the outlook of people lacking education and material wealth. Pastoral people with indirect financial benefits expressed positive attitudes towards elephants for aesthetic reasons, while pastoral people with direct benefits cited financial rewards derived from tourism but attributed aesthetic values to living with elephants. The programme in the pastoral community receiving benefits was exemplary in that benefits were tangible, and the participants appreciated the linkage between benefits and active conservation. Land conversion from pastoralism to agriculture threatens elephant survival, not only in terms of habitat loss, but also in terms of lost tolerance among people who have shifted to farming.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892905001918","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":182}

In order to better protect these natural resources, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources is currently enhancing and extending its network of protected areas. Within the scope of this process the first national parks of Azerbaijan were established in 2003. One of these sites is Ag-Gel National Park comprising Lake Ag-Gel and its surrounding steppe and semi-desert landscapes. Lake Ag-Gel is one of the most important habitats of waterfowl in Transcaucasia. However, the conservation efforts of Ag-Gel National Park are jeopardised due to continuous pressure on its wildlife caused by illegal grazing, fishing and bird poaching activities. There are two fundamental reasons responsible for creating the present situation in this region. Firstly, the process of transformation from a centrally-planned to a market economy that brought about many changes in the lives of people and their relationship and dependence on the natural resources. Secondly, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia that led to the settlement of hundreds of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the vicinity of the national park. New approaches to protected area management emphasise the need to link protected areas to the wider landscape, the regional socio-economic context and more generally to the society and the economy at large. Accordingly, there is little doubt that addressing social concerns of local communities is crucial for the success of any conservation initiative (BORRINI-FEYERABEND & BUCHAN 1997a). Yet, Ag-Gel National Park was planned and established without considering the broader landscape issues or the human context. To date, detailed information on people's livelihoods in the surrounding area of the park as well as on potential conflicts has not been gathered (SUCCOW 2003, pers. com.). In view of this, the study intends to provide @BULLET an analysis of the socio-economic situation in the study area; @BULLET a description of the main land use activities; and @BULLET an examination of conflicts which occur with the national park. Since agriculture is the mainstay of the population in the study area, thus providing the wider social and economic context, the study puts a special focus on this sector. Finally management recommendations for resolving the conflicts with regard to the Ag-Gel National Park will be presented. This study derives from extracts and results of a research conducted within the scope of the diploma thesis of the author on the same topics (see GAUDE 2005).

NTFP-related economic activities can contribute up to 90% of a rural household's income (Bista and Webb 2006). The importance of NTFPs is also reflected at the national level. In 2002, the government earned US$ 1.11 million in revenue from the sale of NTFPs or almost 18% of the total revenue from the forest sector (HMG 2003). Olsen (2005) estimates that from 7000 to 27,000 tons of NTFPs, with a value of US$ 7–30 million, are harvested and traded in Nepal every year. In recognizing this economic value, the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997 Plan ( –2002) recommended sustainable NTFP management for poverty reduction (NPC 1997). The Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002 Plan ( –2007) aimed to further strengthen this by incorporating NTFP management plans in the operational plans of community forest users groups (CFUG) (NPC 2002). CFUGs are the local institutions authorized to manage, consume, and sell excess forest products, including NTFPs, from the forests handed over to them by the government. NTFP management in community forestry is considered one of the approaches for reintegrating marginalized communities in the mainstream of development (HMG 2004). In the socioeconomic context of Nepal, marginalized communities refer to communities that are marginalized because of historical discrimination on the basis of caste, ethnicity, and sex. For the purpose of reintegration, a growing number of CFUGs are including NTFP management plans and provisions for the betterment of such communities in their operational plans and constitutions. These documents have to be approved by the district forest office (DFO). Commercial management of NTFPs for livelihood improvement has been well researched in Nepal and elsewhere. The factors that determine the commercialization of NTFPs are mostly socioeconomic, technical, financial, and political in nature, or are related to market access (Marshall et al 2003; Nygren et al 2006). Most of the studies focus on commercial collection of, and Mountain Research and Development (MRD) An international, peer-reviewed open access journal published by the International Mountain Society (IMS) www.mrd-journal.org trade in, NTFPs in government-managed forests. Such forests often have free access and non–pro-poor management (Olsen and Larsen 2003; Ghimire et al 2008). However, poverty reduction is one of the objectives of community forestry (Pokharel 2009). Pro-poor commercialization of NTFPs in community forestry, that is, delivery of optimum benefits to poor users, must be an integral part of NTFP management. Such management is determined by the institutional arrangements in the CFUG and consists of both formal and informal rules for managing resources. Acharya (2005) mentioned that the development of different institutional arrangements in CFUGs is influenced by various factors such as resource characteristics, community dynamics, and occupation However, it is still unknown which of these factors in particular influences such arrangements for pro-poor commercialization of NTFPs in CFUGs. Therefore, this article presents our analysis of the factors at 3 levels of NTFP management: production, marketing, and benefit sharing. The production level describes the arrangements for managing NTFPs within the forest, the marketing level deals with their marketing within the district, and benefit sharing deals only with NTFP-based pro-poor programs in CFUGs.","doi":"10.1659/mrd.00051","journal":{"name":"Source: Mountain Research and Development","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":186}

A study was conducted amongst 10 villages in the Olokemeji area of Oyo State, Nigeria using standardized interviews of 200 household heads. The oil boom of the 1970s in Nigeria drove many male heads of households in the study area to the cities, but the collapse of the urban unskilled labour market in the 1980s brought men back to the villages. However, by 1990, renewed dominance of female-headed households in the study area has followed further male emigration. Changing roles of women in managing the forest environment are indicated over the three time periods and I argue that female-headed households attempt to conserve and improve the state of the environment more than their male counterparts. This is achieved through the cultivation of less nutrient-demanding crops such as cassava and yam, and using environmentally-friendly farming systems such as terracing and taungya.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":187}

J. and Castilla J. C.","dAbstract":"Best-practice environmental policy often suggests co-management of marine resources as a means of achieving sustainable development. Here we consider the impacts of superimposing co-management policy, in the form of territorial user rights for fishers over an existing traditional community-based natural-resource management system in Chile. We consider a broad definition of co-management that includes a spectrum of arrangements between governments and user groups described by different levels of devolution of power. We used participatory rural appraisal techniques and questionnaires to understand the mechanisms that underpin the traditional management system for the bull-kelp ''cochayuyo'' (Durvillaea antarctica). Traditional management was based on the allocation of informal access rights through a lottery system. This system was controlled by a complex web of traditional institutions that were shown to be successful in terms of equity and resilience. Using a similar approach, we analyzed the effects of superimposing a government-led co-management policy into this traditional system. Two major effects of the new policy were encountered. First, traditional institutions were weakened, which had negative effects on the levels of trust within the community and intensified conflict among users. Second, the management system's adaptive capacity was reduced, thereby jeopardizing the ecosys-tem's resilience. Our results suggest that the devolution of power to this kind of fisher community still has not reached the level required for fishers to legally address the local deficiencies of the Chilean co-management policy. Additionally, legal adjustments must be made to accommodate traditionally managed ecosystems that offer benefits comparable to those mandated under the formal policy. A fuller understanding of the interactions between co-management and traditional institutions can help us to identify ways to promote resilience and facilitate equal access by mitigating the potential negative effects of co-management policy and informing its future implementation.","doi":"10.1007/s10021-005-0007-8","journal":null,"aid":189}

While co-management policy can enhance the management of fisheries, to date there have been few reports concerning how engagement in co-management regimes may affect fishers' perceptions. This paper assesses the determinants of fishers' environmental perceptions within a co-management regime in Chile. Group meetings and structured questionnaires showed fishers' environmental perceptions were composed of four domains of concern, termed 'water pollution', 'stock conservation', 'conservation/profit trade-offs' and 'charismatic species'. Fishers' dependence on diving and/or the length of time fishers had engaged with the policy affected their perceptions of each of these domains. Perceptions of the 'water pollution' domain were related to length of time fishers had participated in co-management, probably because fishers gained an increased understanding of the market and its need for unpolluted produce. Attitudes towards 'conservation/profit trade-offs' tended to become linked to an increasingly conservation-oriented ethic with increasing time of engagement with the policy. Given that the length of time fishers engaged with co-management differentially affected fishers' perceptions of environmental domains of concern, public officials and funding agencies should be careful not to judge co-management prematurely. It takes time to educate participants and overcome distrust. Through co-management processes in Chile, fishers' environmental awareness increased, and sustainable behaviours may consequently increase in the future.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892908004475","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":191}

The species tested were the overexploited Afzelia quanzensis, important for timber and carvings of sculptures and utensils; Sclerocarya birrea, the marula tree used for wood, bark, and fruit; and Brachystegia glaucescens, the dominant miombo tree species, used for firewood, fiber, and fodder. Participants volunteered to plant and manage the test seeds, while a research team monitored their activities and results for 26 months. For Afzelia quanzensis, the germination rate was 81%, and 69% of the seedlings were still alive after one year. In the case of Sclerocarya birrea, the germination rate was 69%, and the one-year survival rate was 50%. For Brachystegia glaucescens, the germination rate was only 30%, and the survival rate was 31%. The main reasons for planting were to provide shade, to serve as a windbreak, and to conserve and gain individual control over dwindling natural resources, particularly Afzelia quanzensis. Women were generally more active and innovative than men. For instance, they searched for their own seeds or seedlings in the bush when there weren't sufficient plants. Some participants tried out various indigenous methods of pest and disease control, water conservation, and moisture retention. Group feedback sessions and informal interactions provided the opportunity to share experiences. The participants learned that indigenous trees can be purposefully planted and were not simply a gift from God. Despite the droughts and political instability of recent years, a growing number of people became involved in tree planting during 2002–2003. As a result, there is now greater awareness among the local population of dwindling resources and their future potential.","doi":"10.1007/s10460-005-6109-2","journal":null,"aid":192}

It is a part of the largest mangrove forest in the world, with an area of about 10,000 km², of which 6,000 km² are in Bangladesh and about 4,000 km² are part of India: it has been recognized as an internationally important World Heritage and Ramsar site. The mangroves provide substantial ecosystem services supporting the livelihood of local communities. This paper describes the diverse uses of these natural resources and aims to evaluate the contribution of ecosystem services to the livelihood of residents. The results indicate that residents depend on ecosystem services in two ways. First, local households earn cash income by selling ecosystem products, such as fi sh, honey, and nipa palm, at local markets. Second, the use of natural resources provides substantial subsistence such as food, fresh water, and timber. However, residents' income may be signifi cantly increased by improved resource management, including reducing local authority corruption and improvements in law enforcement.

In 2007, the beech forests of Uholka were included into the UNESCO World Heritage Site Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians because of their uniqueness. In the course of the reserve's spatial development and the potential integration of populated areas, participatory management arises as a crucial challenge. A first study of local stakeholders (private and state forestry enterprises, local communities), their attitudes and potential conflicts as well as synergies was conducted in 2008. Local communities, especially authorities, generally have a fairly positive attitude towards sustainable development and cooperation. Conflicts exist mainly between the CBR and the forestry sector, which is presently least oriented towards sustainability and rather focussed on economic revenue. We identified a common, but not insurmountable, lack of communication and cooperation between stakeholders. Local acceptance of the CBR is growing. Therefore the CBR can take the lead in applying a more integrative and participatory conservation management approach. 5 R e search eco.m o n t-Vo l u m e 1 , N u m b e r 2 , D e c e m b e r 2 0 0 9 ISSN 2073-106X print version ISSN 2 0 7 3-1 5 5 8 o n l i n e v e r s i o n : h t t p : / / e p u b. o e a w. a c. a t / e c o. m o n t","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":195}

This study aimed to understand the relationship between market proximity, NTFP dependence and forest condition, and assess how it is mediated by local forest institutions. Three villages with different degrees of access to markets for sale of forest products, in an area of high poverty and forest dependence in the dry tropical forest belt in central India, were examined. The village with the greatest access to the market had a greater proportion of income coming from non-forest sources, the least dependence on NTFP harvest and the most degraded forests. The strongest forest institution was found in the village closest to the market, owing largely to its access to support from the Forest Department. This emphasizes the extreme vulnerability of forest villages located distant from local markets, which are forced to depend on forests for most of their livelihood and income requirements, and left to deal with degrading forests in the absence of technical and financial support from the Forest Department. There is a critical need to strengthen local institutions for sustainable forest management in such villages, and to provide them with alternate sources of income generation.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892909005311","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":196}

Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) play an important role in rural livelihoods. People living in and around forests are dependent on a variety of NTFPs for their subsistence and for income generation. This paper gives a general overview on the diversity of NTFPs in the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve, with a focus on medicinal and food plants. Data on NTFPs use were gathered through an ethnobotanical inventory with semistructured , free-listing, and household socioeconomic interviews. Interviews were supplemented with voucher collections. Bamboo shoots were analyzed further as proxy NTPF. It was hypothesized that there is no significant difference between collection amounts of bamboo shoots and their contribution to the household income between the villages studied. A rapid vulnerability assessment (RVA) was conducted to identify vulnerable and threatened species. A total of 480 plant species (25% of recorded flora) from 117 families and 334 genera are used as NTFPs by the local people. Results revealed that there is a significant difference in the collection and contribution of bamboo shoots to household income among the villages. However, their contribution to percapita income is very low, and they are mainly used in households. Vulnerability assessment showed that most of the medicinal species have moderate vulnerable status and that most of the food species have less vulnerable status. Some medicinal plants, such as Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis, are overexploited and getting scarce. Sustainable harvest and management strategies should be implemented to prevent overexploitation of these species. 中国纳板河流域国家级自然保护区内的药用和食用非木材林产品:生计改善及生物多样性保护方面 的意义. 非木材林产品在农村生活中发挥着重要作用。生活在森林之中和周围的人们的生活和收入 有赖于多样的非木材林产品。本文介绍了纳板河流域国家级自然保护区非木材林产品中药用和食用 植物的多样性概况。非木材林产品数据的收集采用了半结构访谈,自由列表和家庭社会经济访谈等民 族植物学调查方法。采访后还采集了植物标本进行鉴定。以竹笋作为非木材林产品的代表进行了进 一步的分析。我们假设竹笋的采集量及其对家庭收入的贡献在所研究的村寨之间无显著差异。采用 单因素方差分析分析对零假设进行了检验。采用快速脆弱性分析方法筛选出了易危和濒危种类。 共调查到当地居民利用的非木材林产品植物有117科,334属,480种(占当地记录植物种类的25%)。 结果显示不同村寨之间竹笋的采集量及其对家庭收入的贡献有显著差异。但是,竹笋对人均收入的 贡献很小因为采集的竹笋主要用于家庭日常生活。脆弱性分析发现大多数药用植物种类处于中等脆 弱水平,大部分食用植物较低的脆弱水平。此外,结果显示有些药用植物如滇重楼已经被过度采集并","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":198}

Spatial and temporal salinity gradients, because of freshwater river inflow and seasonal seawater influx, have created unique characteristics of an estuarine ecosystem, and exercised a continuous, selective influence on the biota. Unfortunately, its biodiversity and the livelihoods that depend on it were being lost at a fast rate because of a blockage of the lagoon's mouth by silt coming from upstream catchments, as well as oceanic long-shore transport. Projects to restore the dynamic characteristics of the lagoon included dredging a new mouth to the ocean, as well as prevention of soil erosion in upstream areas.

M.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION People living in and around any ecosystem like a forest or wetland often exercise more power than governments over the use of local biological resources. However, these people require incentives and appropriate education to enable them to manage these resources sustainably for their own benefit. At present in Kenya most of the peasant farmers who live near or own small patches of wetlands lack basic knowledge on how to manage them. Wetlands are still viewed as sources of diseases such as malaria and also harbour vectors such as those ofbilharzia. People feel that if these wetlands are drained they can eliminate mosquitoes and water-borne diseases. However, growing vegetables using water from swamps can generate income. As most people who live near wetlands live on subsistence farming and are in most cases poor, they have to give daily needs top priority. In order to attract the attention of Government decision-makers, it is necessary to demonstrate in economic terms the values of biological diversity for the country's social and economic development. Such values include resources that are consumed directly such as thatching material and livestock fodder, that are commercially harvested (like fish) and direct and indirect values such as ground water recharge and climate regulation. All too often, these values are taken entirely for granted until it is too late. In order to save wetlands, their fauna and flora, it is essential to understand how the local people view those wetlands and also how they utilise them. At the same time, it is necessary to work with government decision makers. The local community need help in implementing research findings and recommendations. The paper describes a number of community groups and their wetland conservation initiatives in parts of Central and Western Kenya (Figure 1). Case studies illustrate that community participation in wetland conservation is crucial in Africa.","doi":"10.1080/00306525.2000.9639886","journal":{"name":"Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":200}

Evidence from Marine Protected Areas in the Philippines","authors":"Gjertsen H.","dAbstract":"— The hypothesis that sustainable resource management and biodiversity conservation can result in material benefits to participating communities has existed under different guises in the concepts of sustainable development, integrated conservation and development projects, sustainable use, and community-based resource management. What these approaches have in common is the belief that win–win situations between the environment and human development are possible under particular institutional arrangements. Disentangling the factors that contribute to effective conservation and improved human welfare is difficult, but necessary for understanding when these win–win scenarios are likely to emerge. This paper analyzes data on 40 community-based marine protected areas in the Philippines, to determine the correlates of win–win versus lose–lose or trade-off outcomes, measured in terms of childrenÕs nutritional status and coral reef health.","doi":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.07.009","journal":null,"aid":204}

B. and Macedo R. and Glaser M. and Berger A. U.","dAbstract":"When ecosystems are threatened or scientific knowledge of the effects of human action is uncertain, legislative prohibition is often adopted. This paper examines how the criminalization of mangrove tree use affects ecosystem management outcomes. We explore the biological, economic and social sustainability effects of the legal ban on mangrove use on the coast of Bragança, Pará, north Brazil. There are two main categories of mangrove users in this area: firstly, local subsistence users who also derive some financial incomes from mangrove sale. Their mangrove use is intertwined with household livelihood strategies and they display self-initiated planning and action towards sustainable management; secondly, more ''mobile'', purely commercial users who are responsible for most commercial mangrove exploitation and who employ regionally sequential, predatory resource exploitation strategies. These users are typically based at some distance from the exploited areas and share neither local livelihood strategies nor sustainability agendas. The current outright ban on any utilization of mangrove flora seems to undermine biological sustainability, is economically inefficient and generates normative insecurity, conflict and social polarization. The ineffectiveness of the outright legal prohibition of mangrove tree use in terms of sustainable coastal management leads us to investigate alternative management options. We suggest that the legalization of local mangrove utilization and the strengthening of local users' rights and responsibilities to control outsiders in a co-management framework, as proposed in the Brazilian extractive reserves (RESEX) approach, is most likely to advance ecologically, economically and socially sustainable mangrove management. It is demonstrated that a legal recognition of local entitlements to mangrove trees would reduce social vulnerability and therefore move forest management outcomes into more desirable directions..

Top–down participation and emergent rules in marine protected area management in Indonesia","authors":"Glaser M. and Baitoningsih W. and Ferse S. C. and Neil M. and Deswandi R.","dAbstract":"A review of a major community-based marine protected area programme (CB-MPA) in an Indonesian island archipelago is the point of departure for this article. Despite a well-designed institutional structure to facilitate local participation, local knowledge about the CB-MPA is found to be low and resource access and influence on decision-making in the programme is negligible for the majority of islanders. At the same time, most of those who know about the programme consider it as pertaining to the public authority only. These findings stand in contrast to evidence on non-formal ways of protecting and managing marine areas in the same geographical area but outside the formal MPA institutional framework. In particular, the article identifies a number of emergent rules-in-use in marine management, which operate parallel to legally established MPAs. It is argued that emergent forms of marine area protection such as non-formal self-organising island exclusion zones (IEZ) offer as yet mostly unused potentials for formal MPA development, particularly in those coastal and marine areas without traditional forms of marine and coastal management.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2010.04.006","journal":null,"aid":205}

However, eradica-tion is more feasible on islands than on continents. We present a global analysis of 1,224 successful eradica-tions of invasive plants and animals on 808 islands. Most involve single vertebrate species on uninhabited islands, but plant and invertebrate eradications occur more often on inhabited islands. Inhabited islands are often highly modified and support numerous introduced species. Consequently, targeting a single inva-sive species can be ineffective or counterproductive. The impacts of other pests will continue and, in some cases, be exacerbated. The presence of people also creates regulatory, logistical and socio-political constraints. Real or perceived health risks to inhabitants, pets and livestock may restrict the use of some eradication tools, and communities or individuals sometimes oppose eradication. Despite such challenges , managing invasive species is vital to conserve and restore the unique biodiversity of many inhabited islands, and to maintain or improve the welfare and livelihoods of island residents.

As one of the solutions, Participatory Forest Management (PFM) scheme was introduced during the early 1990s by some NGOs. Nearly two decades of experience now exists in the country. However systematic assessments of the performance of the scheme are scanty. This study reports the experience from Bonga PFM project, which is one of the oldest pilot sites. Forest inventory and socioeconomic survey were conducted to collect data. The study was conducted during a transition from NGO-Community to State-Community based management of the PFM project. PFM is shown to have positive impacts both on the state of the forest and living condition of participant households at least within the project life time. Forest conditions such as seedling and sapling densities improved. PFM also (i) promoted awareness about forest, (ii) capacitated locals to form new institutional arrangement that increased their participation in forest management, helped to reduce open access and assisted a regulated forest use, and (iii) contributed towards social equity in terms of gender and minority ethnic groups. When accompanied with complementary non-forest based livelihood activities, PFM helped to diversify income sources, increase household income level, and build household assets. This reduced dependence of communities on forests for livelihoods. A challenge threatening the sustainability of the PFM program in Ethiopia is the weak government support for the scheme. PFM is still far from being mainstreamed in the forest management system of the country. Thus, it will be appropriate to assess how the PFM programs would perform few years after the support of the NGOs terminates. Gestion forestière de participation et ses impacts sur les revenus et le statut forestier: le cas de la forêt de Bonga en Ethiopie T. GOBEZE, M. BEKELE, M. LEMENIH et H. KASSA Les ressources forestières de l'Ethiopie ont subi des décennies de mauvaise gestion due principalement à la définition lâche des relations de propriété de ces ressources. Un projet de gestion forestière de participation (PFM) fut introduit au début des années 90 par quelques organisations non gouvernementales. Le pays possède maintenant presque deux décennies d'expérience dans ce domaine, mais les évaluations systémayiques de la performance du projet sont sommaires. Cette étude brosse un rapport de l'expérience du projet de PFM de Bonga, qui est un des sites pilotes les plus anciens. Un inventaire forestier et une recherche socio-économique ont été effectués pour relever des données. L'étude a été conduite durant une transition du projet PFM, d'une gestion organisations non gouvernementales-communauté à une gestion état-communauté. La PFM prouve avoir des impacts positifs sur l'état de la forêt et les conditions de vie des foyers participants pendant au moins la durée de vie du projet. Les conditions de la forêt telles que les densités de plants et de jeunes arbres se sont améliorées. La PFM a aussi (i) promu une prise de conscience de la forêt, (ii) a donné aux locaux le pouvoir de former un nouvel arrangement constitutionnel augmentant leur participation dans la gestion de la forêt, (iii) a offert une contibution vers l'équité sociale en termes de sexe et de groupes ethniques minoritaires. Quand elle a été acompagnée par des activités complémentaires pour créer des revenus non basés sur la forêt, la PFM a aidé à diversifier les sources de revenus, à élargir le niveau de revenu des foyers, et à fortifier leur avoir. Cela a réduit la dépendance des commmunautés sur la forêt. Le défi menaçant la durabilité du programme de PMF en Ethiopie est le faible soutien gouvernemental pour le projet. La PFM est encore loin d'être courante dans le système de gestion forestière du pays. Il sera par conséquent approprié d'évaluer la performance des programmes de PFM quelques années après la fin de leur soutien par les organisations non-gouvernementales.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"International Forestry Review","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":209}

G o l d e n","authors":"","dAbstract":"In the 2003 Durban Vision the Malagasy government committed to tripling the amount of protected areas in Madagascar by 2009. This extensive expansion needs to involve an assessment of the potential impacts on the people who rely on forest resources for subsistence. Wildlife for human consumption (bushmeat) is one such resource that has received great attention on mainland Africa but has largely been ignored in Madagascar until recently. In terms of biomass, hunting in Madagascar appears to be on a lesser scale compared to areas of mainland Africa. However, because of the life-history characteristics associated with hunted primate and carnivore species in Madagascar even small-scale hunting is a major threat to long-term conservation. In this study I used semi-structured interviews to quantify annual rates of bushmeat harvest in 14 villages adjacent to the Makira Forest in northeastern Madagascar. Interviews revealed that 23 mammal species were hunted for consumption, providing a new insight into the scale and frequency of bushmeat use. Harvest data and life-history information were sufficient to allow quantitative assessments of sustainability for four species of lemur (black and white ruffed lemur Varecia variegata, indri Indri indri, eastern bamboo lemur Hapa-lemur griseus and white-fronted brown lemur Eulemur albifrons) and a species of the carnivore family Eupleridae (fossa Cryptoprocta ferox). Model results suggest hunting of these species is probably unsustainable. This research presents clear evidence that hunting is a major conservation and livelihoods issue in Madagascar and needs to be considered in the planning stages of protected area development to address better the needs of local people.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605309000131","journal":null,"aid":211}

G.","dAbstract":"Vietnam, in the ongoing transition to market economies, has to cope with high rural poverty and a dramatic process of forest loss and environment degradation, particularly in the mountainous regions. The government considers rural poverty as the main cause of environment degradation, associated with slash-and-burn cultivation and to an unclear definition of property rights on forest land. In 1993, the government launched a Forest Land Allocation programme aiming to lease forest lands to individual households and, on this basis, to solve food security problems, halt the increasing environment degradation and preserve the remaining forests. To evaluate the results of this land reform policy, two upland pilot communes have been intensively monitored. The environmental and economic impacts of the forest land reform allocation in the two study areas are presented, after providing a background on the Vietnamese situation of mountain zones. On the basis of these findings, it is discussed as to whether the current forest land allocation process may actually promote local development and natural resources conservation, and under what conditions. Deforestation problems must be tackled also with new macroeconomic policies (e.g. credit programmes to support sustainable agriculture practices) and social policy (e.g. reduction of demographic pressure), together with the reform of the State institutions (e.g. State Forest Enterprises) involved in management of the forest areas.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":212}

Patrick Maundu, an NMK ethnobotanist, organized meetings through the local chiefs where the project was explained. The households immediately next to the forest were identified . Maundu then visited each of these households, conducting a ques-tionnaire and recruiting participants. He interviewed 142 households, and 133 of them agreed to participate (Maundu, 1994). Information on the forest butterflies came from a 9-month inventory and monitoring master's degree research project (Ayiemba, 1997). This showed which species were most abundant, where, and when and provided valuable baseline data on butterfly abundance before the project began. Between June and December 1993, the groundwork for the project was completed. Butterfly species targeted for export were selected on the basis of likely demand, seasonal availability, and ease of rearing. Local larval foodplants were determined and seedlings grown in a nursery at the project headquarters at Gede Ruins. 1 Breeding techniques were developed and field tested using 25 volunteers from the community . A large flight cage and a breeding shed were built. A contract was negotiated with a U.K. entomological dealer, and export procedures were developed in consultation with the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and a courier company in Mombasa (Gordon, 1994). Government involvement in the project was restricted to granting approval for its operations through the District Development Committee and the issuing of export and forest access permits by KWS and FD. Exports started on schedule in February 1994, 8 months after the receipt of funds to start the project, and by the end of 1994, Kipepeo had exported more than 10,000 pupae belonging to 14 species, earning a little under U.S. $16,000 in revenues. The next 4 years saw steady growth in exports and revenues, with more 23,000 pupae exported in 1997 and more than $41,000 earned by the project (Figure 1). El Nino rains starting in 1997 halted growth in 1998, but 1999 was a record year, with almost 55,000 pupae of more than 30 species exported and more than $81,000 earned. Exports peaked in 2000 with gross earnings of $99,320. By the end of 2001, cumulative export earnings had passed $400,000, more than eight times the initial grant that set up the project, and annual income had grown sixfold since 1994. The project has been financially selfsustaining since 1999 (seeTable 1 Note: The loss rate is expressed in terms of lost income in dollars and arises because some of the pupae do not survive the transit process and no payments are received for these. Production costs include payments to the community for the butterfly pupae they produce together with all other costs incurred by the normal operations of the butterfly export business .

By 1999 there were 11 major customers, two based in the United Kingdom and accounting for more than 60% of sales and the rest in the United States and Canada. Since 1999, however, markets have been more or less static. In 2001 they were impacted by the foot and mouth epidemic in Britain and the September 11th atrocity in the United States, both of which reduced the numbers of tourists. Despite the setbacks that periodically affect tourism , butterfly exhibits have proved to be enduring public attractions and are now a standard feature of the tourist industry from Asia to the Americas . The majority are owned by the private sector, although some are run by museums and nonprofit organizations. They have attracted substantial private and corporate investment: A highly successful exhibit at Niagara Falls was constructed in 1996 at a cost of $11 million and was profitable in its first year of operation.","doi":"10.1177/1070496502250439","journal":null,"aid":213}

A.","dAbstract":"Many developing countries experience habitat degradation and unsustainable natural resource exploitation , with biodiversity and habitat conservation efforts often impeded by political instability and limited funding. Challenges in previous conservation efforts coupled with the current rate of marine habitat degradation and species declines warrant consideration of an innovative conservation approach. Co-management of protected areas addresses biological, cultural, economic, and political concerns and empowers communities through collaboration and integration in conservation efforts. It provides flexibility for adaptive practices to address underlying socioeconomic factors affecting conservation efforts and may compensate for limited or missing scientific data. The ecosystems of the Comoros Islands in the West Indian Ocean, a biodiversity hotspot with high endemism and diverse tropical marine habitats, are adversely affected by existing ecological, socioeconomic , and political conditions. Mohéli Marine Park was designed to address threats to the marine environment and is a model for co-management practices. We conducted a year-long evaluation of the park implementation process, including community and fisher participation. After 3 years of operation with 80% local community control, the park maintains a small staff to monitor sea turtle nesting beaches, reef health, fisheries, and uninhabited islets and to guide ecotourists and educate visitors. Our analysis revealed successes and shortcomings of the co-management approach. Successes included local communities empowered to participate in natural resource management, increased local involvement in conservation initiatives, and use of traditional knowledge when scientific information was unavailable. The Comoros example also illustrates that co-management is not immune to social issues, inadequate government law enforcement, or political instability and is an incomplete substitute for sound science. Lessons learned are applicable elsewhere and offer a template for effective scientific research and monitoring, policy making, and management of protected areas in developing nations.

The Orissa Forestry Sector Development Project (OFSDP), beginning in 2006, started to focus on providing inclusive support to local communities living within and around PAs by promoting and enhancing alternative livelihoods through community participation to reduce dependence on forest resources. The participatory processes that were piloted and upscaled in Satkosia Tiger Reserve have helped park managers and policy makers, for the first time in Orissa, to understand and value 'Village Eco-development' as an essential tool in PA management. The experience and lessons learnt have been formulated into guidelines and field manuals for use throughout the State's network of PAs, paving the way for meaningful participatory ecodevelopment. This paper describes the participatory process and mechanisms evolved and upscaled to engage with local communities in ecodevelopment partnerships; defines the principles and mechanisms that underpin such partnerships; and demonstrates how management interventions can be effectively and equitably prioritised towards those members of a community most dependent on forest resources in order to maximise biodiversity conservation. Lessons learned include the importance of developing a shared vision at the outset, joint government-community collaboration in building capacities, independent expert facilitation and long-term nurturing of participatory processes, provision of well-defined livelihood enhancement opportunities and experiential learning among all stakeholders.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":218}

In addition, MPAs and their networks are often the core strategy for larger scale and more integrated forms of marine resource management that can lead to ecosystem-based management regimes for seascapes and eco-regions. This study conducted in 2008 documents the status of selected MPAs and MPA networks in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea, to better understand development and their level of success in the Coral Triangle. Findings reveal that substantial gaps exist between the theory and practice of creating functional MPA networks. Across these sites, biophysical and social science knowledge, required to build functional and effective MPAs or MPA networks, lagged behind substantially. Aspects that appeared to require the most attention to improve MPA network effectiveness included essential management systems, institutional arrangements, governance and sustainable fi nancing. Common indicators of success such as increased fi sh catch and habitat quality parameters were consistently associated with several independent variables: sustainable fi nancing for management, clarity of MPA network rules, enforcement by community level enforcers, local skills development, and involvement in management by local elected politicians, a functional management board, multi-stakeholder planning mechanisms and participatory biophysical assessments.

L. and Basurto X.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction Common pool resource (CPR) theory as defined by the Bloomington School (Aligica and Boettke, 2011) emerged mainly from research in local, small-scale settings (Ostrom, 1990). A critical research frontier is the governance of larger CPRs, which requires analysis of interdependencies among different levels and scales of more complex systems (Heikkila et al., 2011; Ostrom, 2009). We take Elinor Ostrom's design principle of polycentric, nested enterprises in long enduring, larger CPR systems as a starting point for interdisciplinary research on the governance of large CPRs (Marshall, 2008). Specifically, this paper brings together institutional theories of polycentricity and critical human geography theory on scalar politics to contribute to emerging research and policy agendas on the governance of larger CPRs by advancing understanding of the form and function of nested, polycentric regimes. We highlight complementarities between these theoretical approaches in agreement with Lejano (2006) that multiple analytical lenses can reveal different aspects of a policy situation. A well-suited policy arena in which to explore these issues is marine conservation governance, particularly marine e n v i r o n m e n t a l s c i e n c e & p ol i c y 3 3 ( 2 0 1 3 ) 2 6 0 – 2 7 2 a r t i c l e i n f o This paper brings together institutional theories of polycentricity and critical human geography theory on scalar politics to advance understanding of the form and function of nested, polycentric regimes for the governance of large-scale common pool resources. We focus on institutional changes associated with a national marine protected area network in Palau through which national government and NGOs gain influence in local decisionmaking processes. Influence is gained through an attempt to scale up common-pool resource governance to an ecologically-relevant spatial scale in an effort to protect coral reef resilience and biodiversity across Palau. An institutional approach informed by scalar politics brings into focus potential tradeoffs between organizing governance reform around ecologically versus institutionally relevant scales. Our analysis suggests that prioritization of ecologically-relevant scales in institutional reform resulted in more nested but less polycentric institutional arrangements governing the network. We conclude that less distributed decision-making in the overall nested governance system could threaten the sustainability and resilience of coral reefs in the long-term by constraining institutional innovation and diversity. Results demonstrate the potential for interdisciplinary dialog to advance the research frontier on multi-level governance for large common pool resources. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/envsci protected area MPA networks. Marine ecologists have concluded , ''If marine reserves and other MPAs are to provide significant conservation benefits to species, they must be scaled up'' (Gaines et al., 2010, p. 18286). As an alternative to scaling up the geographic extent of individual MPAs, conservationists are increasingly promoting large scale marine governance through networks of smaller MPAs that may spread the costs of conservation across resource owners and/ or users, and ''can have emergent benefits that make the network more than the sum of its individual parts'' (Gaines et al., 2010, p. 18286 ). The most prominent global policymaking fora (i.e., World Summit on Sustainable Development, the World Parks Congress, and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity) have all called for ecologically representative MPA networks (Gray, 2010). In theory, an MPA network stretching across a large marine CPR is networked in both biophysical and social dimensions. As Agardy (2005, p. 244) has pointed out, an MPA network has ''a dual nature'' of ''connecting physical sites deemed ecologically critical (ecological networks), and linking people and institutions in order to make effective conservation possible (human networks).'' While there has been a proliferation of research on the biophysical dimensions of MPA networks (e.g., Airamé et al., 2003; Botsford et al., 2003; Gaines et al., 2010; Moffitt et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2003), there has been comparatively little research on the political and institutional dimensions thereof (but see Grilo, 2011; Lowry et al., 2009; Sievanen et al., 2013). To be clear, institutions herein refer to the formal and informal rules, norms, and strategies that structure human interactions (Ostrom, 2005). To address this gap and explore our theoretical interests in multi-level governance for larger CPRs, we focus on institutional changes and politics associated with a national protected area network (PAN hereafter) in the western Pacific Island nation of Palau, a context in which communities of resource users both own and manage marine resources. Through the PAN, national government and NGO actors are providing financial incentives to resource users/owners to voluntarily enroll pre-existing and new protected areas 1 into a national network. Although resource users maintain ownership of PAN sites, there are significant changes to the process of governing those sites. As the PAN attempts to increase the spatial scale of marine governance to accommodate goals of biodiversity conservation, national government and conservation NGOs gain more influence in local decision-making processes. We conclude that the pursuit of large-scale marine conservation in Palau has led to a more nested but less polycentric governance system, and caution that decreased local autonomy may reduce the institutional diversity upon which the long-term sustainability of CPRs may depend. Results are broadly relevant as Palau's PAN is being promoted as a model for other nations seeking to meet their commitments to multilateral environmental agreements. 2 2. Complementary perspectives on multilevel CPR governance According to Giordano (2003, p. 365), ''the field of geography has been relatively silent in the commons literature, especially on the theoretic front.'' This is beginning to change. There is an emerging foundation of interdisciplinary theoretical dialog regarding the relationships between physical geography, resource users, and institutional arrangements for CPR governance (e.g., Araral, 2013a,b; Brewer, 2010; Giordano, 2003). However, there remains little constructive engagement between Bloomington School institutional theorists and critical human geographers interested in the scalar dimensions of CPR governance (hereafter, institutional theorists and critical human geographers) (Poteete, 2012), arguably due to divisive tensions about core questions, values, assumptions and methodologies (Johnson, 2004; Mosse, 1997). While Johnson (2004) concludes that co-existence is more likely than convergence, 3 there is emerging interest in a third option: complementarity (e.g., Armitage, 2008; Clement, 2010; Campbell, 2007; Poteete, 2012). Poteete (2012) for example, brings together concepts across multiple disciplines, including critical human geography and Bloomington institutional analysis, to argue for broader perspectives on the multi-level institutions and multiple scale linkages characterizing CPRs. Research taking a broader perspective, she argues, ''is less likely to overlook important elements, relationships, or processes'' (Poteete, 2012, p. 147). Armitage (2008, p. 7) similarly advocates for ''critical reflection'' on multi-level governance for CPRs, calling for the exchange of ideas from common property theory, resilience thinking, and political ecology. In agreement that ''continued cross-fertilization of ideas is crucial for the evolution of commons governance'' (Armitage, 2008, p. 26 ), we explore complementarity between ''Bloomington institutionalism'' (Aligica and Boettke, 2011, p. 29), grounded in the seminal work of Vincent and Elinor Ostrom et al., and critical human geography theory on scalar politics. This section describes arguments and analytical foci within each literature, demonstrating that they share key concerns with power, scale, and multi-level governance. We argue that key components of the theoretical perspectives fit together to structure a more comprehensive analysis of multi-level governance regimes for larger CPRs, such as networks of marine protected areas.","doi":"10.1016/j.envsci.2013.06.006","journal":null,"aid":222}

This shift was driven partly by the change to democratic government in 1994, but was also heavily influenced by concurrent global moves towards more participatory forest management and devolution of natural resource management (Matose and Downloaded by [ Wily, 1996; Grundy, 2000; Campbell and Shackleton, 2001; DWAF, 2001). In the new South Africa, the country's natural forests are viewed as a source oflivelihood for local people. With the change to democracy, rural communities have high expectations of social improvement through job creation and of greater control over previously denied natural resources (DW AF, 2001 ). At the same time the maintenance of the services provided by indigenous forests and woodlands, such as biological diversity and hydrological regimes, remains central to the government's policy of responsible forest management (DW AF, 1997). The major challenge facing forest conservation in South Africa today is to develop management systems that deliver both environmental sustainability and secure long-term, tangible benefits for local people. Rural livelihoods, particularly those of the poor, are complex and dynamic, based on a wide range of activities and strategies ( Cavendish, 2002). Research in this field over the past decade has moved from documenting community use of natural resources, to understanding the complexities of institutional governance in order to meet community needs (see Murombedzi, 1991; Murphree, 1993; Matose and Wily, 1996; Crook and Manor, 1998; Saxena, 1997; Ribot, 1999). Experience has shown that the key to real empowerment of communities in order for them to manage their natural resources sustainably lies in governments' ability to devolve decision-making powers to the local level (Murphree, 2000; Wily and Mbaya, 2001). The aim of the study was to understand the nature of the stakeholders and institutions affecting forest use in a rural area of the Eastern Cape. The study was conducted in the remote communal area surrounding the coastal Nature Reserve of Dwesa!Cwebe, in the former apartheid-created 'homeland' of Transkei in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. This area was the scene of one of the first attempts by the South African government to resolve a dispute over forest access by local people. The research focused on the Hobeni community, adjoining Cwebe Forest on the north-eastern side of the Reserve, a key question being: How feasible is a participatory forest management system for this forest, and what opportunities and constraints are involved?

However, research on the financial rewards from NTFP collection and its contribution to sustainable development is equivocal. In a case study in the Periyar Tiger Reserve, India, we examined whether NTFP collection can solve livelihood problems by analysing revenues obtained from various NTFP species, estimating the economic returns to collectors from various social backgrounds, and exploring the attitudes of collectors towards their profession. We found that black damar resin from the tree Canarium strictum (61.3%) and mace from Myristica spp. (35.5%) were the most commonly collected NTFPs, and the most valuable NTFPs were honey from Apis cerana indica (USD 4.12 kg-1), cardamom Elettaria cardamomum (USD 3.67 kg-1) and Myristica spp. (USD 2.77 kg-1). Mean daily revenue from NTFP collection was USD 3.15 – SD 4.19 day-1 , and the lowest daily revenues were earned by part-time collectors with low socioeconomic status such as migrants, forest-dwellers or those without access to agricultural land. Most collectors (82%) did not wish to continue harvesting NTFPs if alternative livelihoods from agriculture could be provided, and none wanted their children to be NTFP collectors. Our findings suggest that, with respect to social justice, poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability, the role of NTFP collection in sustainable development is questionable.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605308071111","journal":null,"aid":227}

Although it is crucial to integrate the interests of surrounding communities into PA management, key drivers of changes in local populations and the effects of conservation on local livelihoods and perceptions remain poorly understood. We assessed population changes from 1990 to 2010 in 9 villages located between 2 PAs with different management policies (access to natural resources or not). We conducted semi-directive interviews at the household level (n = 217) to document reasons for settlement in the area and villager's attitudes toward the PAs. We examined drivers of these attitudes relative to household typology, feelings about conservation, and concerns for the future with mixed linear models. Population increased by 61% from 2000 to 2010, a period of political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe. Forty-seven percent of immigrants were attracted by the area; others had been resettled from other villages or were returning to family lands. Attitudes toward PAs were generally positive, but immigrants attracted by the area and who used resources within the PA with fewer restrictions expressed more negative attitudes toward PAs. Household location, losses due to wild animals, and restrictions on access to natural resources were the main drivers of this negative attitude. Profit-seeking migrants did not expect these constraints and were particularly concerned with local overpopulation and access to natural resources. To avoid socio-ecological traps near PAs (i.e., unforeseen reduced adaptive capacity) integrated conservation should address mismatches between management policy and local expectations. This requires accounting for endogenous processes, for example, local socio-ecological dynamics and values that shape the coexistence between humans and wildlife.

Particular attention is paid to the position of outsider fishers or andon, who have a legal right to access the resource rich fishing grounds. Decentralised district government legitimises outsider fisheries activities because andon fishing permits bring in fees as a contribution to the regional income (PAD or pendapatan asli daerah), while international environmental organisations and local fishers regard the outsider fishers as illegitimately entering the MPA to access resources they regard as their own. Thus, MPA boundaries appear to be highly permeable, with both local fishers and environmental NGOs seeing the presence of andon as illegitimate and illicit, despite being legal.","doi":"10.1080/00664677.2012.694173","journal":{"name":"Journal of Social Anthropology and Comparative Sociology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":233}

This intensive management approach involves the re-introduction of wild dogs into suitable conservation areas and periodic translocations among them. To assess the attitudes towards reintroduced wild dogs, we conducted a questionnaire survey of multiple stakeholders—local community members, private landowners and tourists—in and around Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), one of the meta-population conservation areas. Here, we document conflicting human interests over M. Gusset Á R. Slotow the reintroduced wild dogs. Tourists in HiP, on the one hand, expressed overwhelmingly positive opinions about wild dogs across personal details of the respondents, but especially after having seen free-ranging wild dogs. On the other hand, we found misconceptions and perceptions that were more negative among the rural population around HiP, again largely independent of personal details of the participants, although educated respondents voiced more favourable views of wild dogs. These negative attitudes were in particular due to perceived and real threats of livestock losses. In a follow-up questionnaire survey, we also discovered apparent shortcomings of a previous short-lived conservation education programme among the local communities adjacent to HiP. Consequently, the mitigation of the conflict between wild dogs and rural people requires an understanding of the conditions under which livestock predation occurs, the encouragement of practices that prevent such predation, and increasing local tolerance of coexistence with wild dogs through both economic and non-monetary incentive schemes as well as continued conservation education.","doi":"10.1007/s10531-007-9232-0","journal":{"name":"Biodivers Conserv","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":237}

This paper identifies drivers of FMNR adoption and assesses its impacts on rural households in the Region of Maradi, Niger, an area covering 42,000 square kilometers. The results show that 26% of households practice a form of FMNR involving both pruning and protecting woody vegetation. Adoption is strongly linked to soil type, market access, and the education level of the head of household. FMNR raises household income and increases crop diversity, household migration rates, and the density and diversity of trees on farmland. It is estimated that FMNR raises the annual gross income of the region by between 17 and 21 million USD and has contributed an additional 900,000 to 1,000,000 trees to the local environment. These findings support the value of continued promotion of FMNR as an inexpensive means of enhancing rural livelihoods and an attractive alternative to reforestation efforts relying on tree planting.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.01.027","journal":null,"aid":245}

Furthermore, there is rarely enough private investment taking place to commensurate the scale of the problem. This article examines the role of tenure insecurity, resource poverty, risk and time preferences, and community-led land conservation on differentiated patterns of household investment in land conservation in northern Ethiopia. We control for biophysical, household characteristics, market access conditions, and village level factors. Investments in soil bunds and stone terraces are specifically studied so as to capture the link between these various factors and the durability of conservation investments. We introduce the distinction between the determinants of the decision to invest and how much to invest in conservation. Regression results show that publicly led conservation programs seem to significantly stimulate private investment. A host of plot-level variables and household perceptions of returns on conservation investments, expressed in terms of perceived improvements in land quality and increased crop yields, were found to be critical to the decision to invest and intensify soil conservation. The evidence on the significance of households' attitudes toward risk aversion suggests the important role of risk and the household's risk-bearing capacity in the decision to intensify conservation measures. At the same time, tenure security indicators and households' resource endowments (resource poverty) had weaker effects in increasing willingness to invest and the level of investment made. The policy implications of these results point to the importance of agricultural research and extension efforts that target technologies which reduce household risk and poverty while enabling sustainable investments in conservation measures by individual households.

However, a number of challenges face communities wanting to initiate or maintain formal, community-based forest management. Through a grounded theory approach, this paper uses three case studies of community forest management models in the eastern Amazon to create a framework showing challenges faced by communities at different phases of formal management. The framework shows that, in the development phase, four root problems (land ownership, knowledge acquisition, community organization, and adequate capital) need to be addressed to obtain legal management permission. With this permission in hand, further challenges to oper-ationalization are presented (deterring illegal loggers, maintaining infrastructure, obtaining necessary managerial skills and accessing markets). The interrelatedness of these challenges emphasizes that all challenges need to be addressed in a holistic manner for communities to maintain a profitable and self-sufficient operation. This contradicts current development approaches that only address part of this framework. The framework proposed here can be used as a starting point for community forestry initiatives in other regions.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.03.042","journal":null,"aid":248}
{"filename":"Hajjar et al. 2012","year":2012,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Decentralization of forest management, the process by which a central government \"cedes powers to actors and institutions at lower levels in a political-administrative hierarchy\" (Mawhood 1983, cited in Ribot et al. 2006:1865), has been a major trend in global forest governance for the past three decades (Ribot et al. 2006, Agrawal et al. 2008). This is particularly apparent in the developing world: 22% of forests are community-owned or managed (Rights and Resources Initiative and the International Tropical Timber Organization 2009), and more than three-quarters of developing countries and countries in transition are in the midst of experimenting with decentralization of natural resource management (Ribot 2004, Contreras-Hermosilla et al. 2006). We consider community-based forest management as a form of democratic decentralization of forest governance, i.e., the transfer of power over forest resources and management to local governments and authorities representative of local populations. Theoretically, decentralized management can improve efficiency, equity, democracy, and resource management (Ribot 2004, Ribot et al. 2006), and empirical evidence has shown that decentralization of decision making can benefit natural resource quality (reviewed in Garnett et al. 2007, Sayer et al. 2008). Indeed, community-based forest management in cases around the world has improved efficiency, equity, democracy, and ecosystem health in forestdependent communities (Larson 2005, Molnar et al. 2007). For these reasons, community-based forest management has been promoted as a model to create long-term economic development and self-reliance in rural communities, while promoting the conservation and sustainable use of forests and consolidating rights over traditional lands and resources (Scherr et al. 2003, Pagdee et al. 2006, Bray et al. 2008). Effective decentralization strategies are meant to increase the capacity of local populations to make their needs and demands heard, and to increase the interactive capacity of local governments through fair elections, multiple accountability mechanisms, and local government associations (Larson 2003). Yet studies have shown that devolution policies have had both positive and negative livelihood benefits (Edmunds and Wollenberg 2003a), and that, in many cases, devolution of forest management authority from states to communities has been \" partial and disappointing \" (Charnley and Poe 2007:301). In many cases, statutory rights given to communities have not automatically turned into rights in practice, communities have not been able to turn those new rights into benefits, and central governments oftentimes obstruct the decentralization process and retain control over resource management (Edmunds and Wollenberg 2003b, Wittman and Geisler 2005, Ribot et al. 2006, Larson and Soto 2008). Ribot et al. (2006) note ways that central governments can undermine the ability of local governments to make decisions, including by limiting the kinds of powers transferred. Transfer to local governments of significant authority regarding forest resources is rare (Larson 2005). Even with increased decentralization and an enhanced role for local forest users, such users have often had little influence in deciding on management objectives, especially when state objectives conflict with local livelihoods, cultural values, and local management systems (Edmunds and Wollenberg 2003b). Thus, prior to assessing the consequences of decentralization on forests and forest-dependent people and gauging the efficacy of decentralization strategies, it is useful to take a step back and assess the extent of democratic decentralization that has actually occurred. Here, this is done by assessing how much \" real \" power communities have acquired over forest resources; are they now the ones in control of the resource and able to make management decisions? This study considers the local level and systematically assesses the amount of power that the forest user and the community have over managing forest resources. This viewpoint is novel in that it seeks an assessment that is local stakeholder-centric; instead of using the central government as the starting point and assessing powers devolved to lower levels of government, it looks at the individual forest user or community and the amount of decision-making power acquired at that level. An exploratory case study approach is taken to assess decentralization of forest governance in Brazil and Mexico. The question is asked, qualitatively-speaking, how much control do communities have over governing their forest resources? A framework for assessment is developed that identifies criteria of relevance to community members' rights and day-to-day activities, which are criteria that community members in case study communities identified as important aspects of control or rights over forest resources. These criteria, which form the elements of the framework, provide a tool for systematically assessing, from a community perspective, how much forest management decentralization is actually occurring in terms of decision-making power acquired at the local level. The resulting outcome of this exploratory work is then used to open a discussion questioning the appropriate amount of, and process for, decentralization.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":247}

On Langkawi Island, the formation of cooperative community resource management, Komuniti Pengurusan Sumber Perikanan (KPSP), or, formerly, fishermen economic groups, Kumpulan Ekonomi Nelayan (KEN), in 2001 is a significant attempt to emphasise the value of local involvement in natural resource management. This article aims to examine the importance of local community engagement in resource management through participation in selected fishing communities on the island. To this purpose, concepts from transformative learning theory are applied to understand how interactions among adults, through their participation in resource management, can promote learning and social change. The findings indicate a number of motivators and challenges to education, such as opportunities for dialogues, leadership and changes in behaviour, that occur at the community level. In conclusion, this study concurs that active local participation in resource management would allow members of the community to learn about natural resources and that such learning can lead to concrete actions on the ground towards sustainable solutions. Therefore, further research must focus on improving the forms of local participation in resource management to provide space for more and more effective education.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Kajian Malaysia","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":249}

On fallow land, an average of 2,416 trees/ha was recorded; on cropped land, an average of 56 trees/ha was recorded. Trees within cropped land are mostly regenerated naturally, and farmers demonstrated knowledge and interest in tree management. The current development strategies poorly acknowledge the value to local farmers of indigenous tree species and the local tree management practices.

A questionnaire survey and informal interviews are conducted among 74 households, in three villages, in and around the park. The survey reveals that almost all people knew about the existence and the laws of the park. Many people recognize and understand the importance of the global conservation of the park. In addition, most people agree that local participation is indispensable for conservation. Furthermore, people tend to be eager to use secondary forests or scrubs rather than primary forests or old secondary, recognizing the use of forest ecosystems in a sustainable manner. However, many people would like to claim the right to use the forests and lands within the park. People are only interested in meeting their daily needs from the park at the moment. Fortunately, they hope to participate in the park administration and are also enthusiastic about cooperating with related stakeholders including government authorities and NGOs. The results of the survey can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the local community does not have enough information about the park and, consequently, people only follow the compulsory laws. Secondly, local conservation knowledge and the global objectives of park management cannot be harmonized because of the lack of information and agreement concerning the park between local people and government authorities. People do not have certain incentives to conserve biodiversity, as they cannot get any benefits from the park. Thirdly, in spite of these adverse findings, it largely depends on the government authorities' capabilities whether the integrated park management can succeed or not, because people still have positive attitudes towards local participation.","doi":"10.1007/s10310-003-0037-z","journal":{"name":"J For Res","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":254}

FSC group certification was introduced in the area of teak community forest of several villages in 2005. Because of local strong interest in group certification, the size of certified forests, the number of group certification members and the amount of certified wood harvested gradually increased. The support of a local NGO and an international NGO contributed towards successful establishment of group certification and establishment of a small-scale forestry enterprise producing certified wood in a sustainable manner. These NGOs played important roles in establishing strong relationships between producers and consumers , strengthening local forest management institutions, and promising social and economic benefits to the local people.","doi":"10.1007/s11842-013-9240-8","journal":{"name":"Small-scale Forestry","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":255}

A so-called hill tribe problem has been officially identified as a result of the slash-and-burn cultivation and other perceived problems, such as opium poppy cultivation, illegal immigration, and the suspicion of disloyalty to the state. This has created distrust and tension between the groups and authorities. The local conflict has recently been related to the dilemma of conserving the forest from all human interference, while many people live and make their livelihood within and adjacent to the protected areas. Furthermore, as the results imply, strictly protected areas and reforestation have also increased the competition over land and natural resources and, thereby, the likelihood of local conflicts. The scarcity and pollution of water, illegal logging, and poor fire control have contributed to the conflicts between local communities. The conflicts between the local communities and officials have been nourished by political and public discussions. Using definitions and terms with negative connotations and ignoring the heterogeneity between the groups or labeling some groups as malevolent have increased distrust and strengthened existing stereotypical images. Conflict resolution starts with efforts toward better mutual understanding, and changes in structures and attitudes are necessary. Local cooperation, utilization of traditional methods, and local institutions are central to conflict solving.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-008-9239-7","journal":null,"aid":256}

We present experiences of the incorporation of sexual and reproductive health services within a pre-existing community-based marine conservation initiative in Madagascar as part of an integrated population, health and environment (PHE) programme. Our results demonstrate the considerable demand for, and lack of social barriers to, the introduction of sexual and reproductive health services in this region. These findings emphasize the mutually beneficial synergies, supporting both public health and conservation objectives, which can be created by integrating sexual and reproductive health services into more conventional biodiversity conservation activities. This PHE approach demonstrates the inextricable link between reproductive health and resource use by providing practical, immediate and lasting benefits to public health, gender equity, food security and biodiversity conservation.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605311000925","journal":null,"aid":257}

This study investigates perceptions held by individuals in three communities bordering a marine protected area in Costa Rica about consumptive and non-consumptive use of sea turtles on nesting beaches to determine how best to achieve sustainable management of the species. Face-to-face interviews (n ¼48 community members and n ¼ 8 key informants) were conducted in three communities (Cahuita Town, Hone Creek, and Playa Negra) during April and May 2009. The research found that in each community, residents' perceptions about consumptive and non-consumptive use were divided into four categories: norm-activated pro-and anti-environmentalism; and rationally self-interested pro-and anti-environmentalism. Given this perceptual diversity, it seems clear that no single management strategy would work successfully across all three communities, but that customised management measures were required to manage sea turtle populations in each area. The wider implication of this study is that there is no simple panacea for dealing with declining populations of sea turtles: each situation is sui generis, requiring measures tailored exclusively to its particular circumstances.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2013.03.008","journal":null,"aid":258}

Sustainable tropical forestry must integrate forest conservation and economic development. Key ecological factors discussed here include: reproduction. natuml regenemtion, growth, ecosystem functions, and biodiversity conservation. Four models of sustainable tropical forestry are described: 1) Industrial timber production based on the PORTICO company in Costa Rica that owns and manages its prod,uction forests and makes a substantive investment in research. 2) Community-based timber production using the Yanesha Forestry Cooperative in the Peruvian Amazon as an example of local empowerment over the protection and use of forests. This Coop has a local processing facility that enables most of the timber to be marketed, and it uses an innovative strip-cut management system that promotes excellent natuml regenemtion of native tree species. 3) Community-based production of nontimber forest products depends on local rights of access or tenure to tropical forests. However. more information is needed on harvestable levels and man­ agement techniques as local preferences move from subsistence uses to com­ mercial production. 4) Locally controlled nature tourism is touted as the most benign use of tropical forests, but local communities receive minimal economic returns and have little say in prioritizing development objectives.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":259}

{"filename":"Hartter and Goldman 2009","year":2009,"title":"I Conservation, and Sustaining Rural Livelihoods around Kibale National Park, Uganda Photographs by authors","authors":"Hartter J. and Goldman A. C.","dAbstract":"Introduction Parks around the world have been used as primary mechanisms for conservation. Since the first national park (Yellowstone) was created in 1872, there are now over 100,000 parks and protected areas worldwide, covering more than 10% of earth's land surface (Hayes 2006). However, the process of protecting land around the world has not been without incident and certainly has sparked conflict on all political scales. Despite these conflicts, national parks remain in favor, and new parks are created every year. At the same time, conservation objectives have become more complex as conservation has moved from single species conservation to an ecosystem approach that often limits use in these areas by local people. The park/people relationships are becoming more controversial as pro-protection and pro-community paradigms clash. Opinions on how best to conserve nature range from stressing the critical importance of preserving and protecting a relatively small remnant of \" wild nature \" from human intervention (fortress conservation model) (Terborgh 1999) to more inclusive community participation and benefits sharing (community-based natural resource management model) (Hulme and Murphree 2001). Under the fortress conservation model where parks have hard-edged boundaries, often indigenous peoples have had little to no input in park establishment and are excluded or forcibly removed from these areas despite having ties to the land from settlement, traditional hunting, and grazing rights. In addition, the new park is likely to maintain few linkages with livelihood or development goals. Under these conditions, attitudes toward a park can be predominantly negative in communities near their boundaries. This paper provides an assessment of attitudes towards Kibale National Park (Kibale), a mid-altitude forest park in western Uganda that exhibits many attributes of this fortress-type brand of consemation and which is surrounded by a very densely populated agricultural landscape. As with many parks in Africa (see Brockington 2004; Brockington and Igoe 2006), Kibale was established without the blessing of the local population. Park neighbors have been excluded from access, resources, and settlement. As evidence of this exclusion, the park has become an island of forest whose boundaries are clearly visible despite the absence of a fence or other physical barrier to separate the park from the agricultural landscape (Figure 1). We were interested in understanding whether a people held positive attitudes towards a nearby park despite many negative impacts stemming from the park's establishment (Figure 2). In many ways, Kibale can be considered a conservation success story. The boundaries of this small island forest are intact and little large-scale incursion occurs, forest continues to dominate the park, and the park supports a high level of biological diversity. Our recent, preliminary research with a broad sample of farmers and other land users around the park found a range of attitudes and responses to the park that contrast sharply with results from other studies conducted around savannah parks in East Africa. Expulsion, exclusion, and imposition of external control are dominant themes in studies of the history and socioeconomic impacts of parks, and these are expected to have resulted in very negative responses to those parks by local people, particularly for the large proportion of parks that represent \" fortress conservation. \" Our research in the densely populated area around Kibale National Park found an alternative narrative expressed by the majority of local residents in which Kibale is viewed favorably, but for reasons not discussed in most related studies. We compared results from household surveys from areas heavily visited by park outreach programs, tourists, international researchers, and NGOs with an area that has received comparatively less attention by these same groups.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":262}

Expulsion, exclusion and the imposition of external control are dominant themes, resulting in negative responses to parks, particularly those that represent hard-edged so-called fortress conservation. Our research in the densely populated area around a mid altitude forest park in western Uganda found an alternate narrative in which, despite its hard-edged fortress features, most people view Kibale National Park favourably. Based on a geographically random sample in two agricultural areas neighbouring the Park, our results indicate that most households felt they benefit from the Park and only a small proportion cited negative impacts. Rather than direct economic returns, the benefits most commonly noted by respondents can be characterized as ecosystem services. Most individual respondents and a large majority of the local political leaders said that the Park should continue to exist. Crop raiding by animals from the Park is a problem in some locations but resource restrictions and expulsion were not widely cited by our respondents. The fact that the large majority of residents migrated to the area after the Park was established may be an important explanatory factor for these responses, and this is also likely to be the case for many other mid altitude tropical forest parks, the demographic and land-use histories of which differ from those around many savannah parks.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605310000141","journal":null,"aid":261}

Kibale National Park in western Uganda is a remnant of a previously larger, mid-altitude forest region surrounded by dense agricultural settlement. We combine remote sensing techniques and household surveys to examine landscape change and fragmentation and the implications for securing rural livelihoods. Forests and wetlands outside the park provide important resources such as fuelwood, building poles, and water, but they are also problematic for local farmers since crop raids by primates and elephants emanate from these fragments. Our analysis shows that since 1984 forests and wetlands have decreased in size and number and those that remain have become increasingly isolated within the agricultural mosaic. Farmers have adapted to resource shortages and human–wildlife conflict in different ways. Our results suggest that wealth, ethnicity, and distance from the park are important factors in determining responses to these issues.","doi":"10.1016/j.jnc.2010.06.005","journal":{"name":"Journal for Nature Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":263}

The projects managed to achieve their objectives in conservation and poverty reduction at various degrees. Enhanced conflict resolution capacity involving private stakeholders, conservation agents and local communities, as well as improved collaboration between projects, helped to solve part of the conflicts. This was the case with the negotiation of rights of access for beekeepers to Rukwa game reserve. However, enduring sector based approaches continue to hinder opportunities for developing multiple use approaches. Contrasted results of the projects can be explained by factors inherent to projects' planning and management, but also by factors that are beyond projects' influence such as the historical and contemporary context in terms of governance of natural resources and more globally, of power relationships between the state, private organisations and the communities.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":265}

As collaboration between local people and forestry officials is seen as indispensable to effective and sustainable local forest management, the objective of this study is to clarify the issues pertinent to the resolution of latent conflict between these two stakeholders. The issues are examined by presenting two case studies in terms of forest management as perceived by local people and forestry officials; the first in a rich forest area and the second in a degraded forest. Issues relating to land and borders and social capital are identified as the most important in the degraded forest area, while social capital is a very important issue in the rich forest area. Our studies show that the problems of land and border issues in the degraded forest area were caused by an inappropriate resettlement policy. This can be interpreted as the mismanagement of social capital , and for effective local forest management it is very important to overcome problems of this nature. The effective use of social capital has so far been overlooked, however, in the establishment of collaborative forest governance at the local level.","doi":"10.1080/13504500609469658","journal":null,"aid":930}

This paper examines the sustainability of a PES silvopastoral programme in Colombia from peasant farmers' perspectives. Programme participants were asked questions regarding their perceived ability to continue with the silvopastoral practices, the influence of the economic benefits and contracts on behavioural change, and the programme's impacts on self-determination, innovation and social learning; factors considered critical for sustained resource management. While the participants expressed a need for the PES programme practices, less than half stated that they would continue with the silvopastoral measures and only 13% understood that part of their contractual commitment was to conserve forests. Ten per cent of the participants considered themselves the principal decision-maker in the farm-level changes and only one participant had altered the prescribed practices, despite a common perception that some techniques were not suitable for the region. The results suggest a need to reexamine the degree to which the PES model in fact encourages adaptive management practices and sustained land-use behaviours in peasant communities.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892912000045","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":267}

Lion killing is shaped by Maasai perception of livestock depreda-tion, socioeconomic factors, and the complex relationship between Maasai and conservation. These all affect tolerance for lions and consequently Maasai behavior towards conservation initiatives and carni-vores in general. We used an in-depth quantitative questionnaire and participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) to identify the social and ecological predictors of lion killing and to investigate the effect of a compensation scheme on individual tolerance. Individuals who lose a greater proportion of their livestock to predators relative to their overall livestock loss, those affiliated with an evangelical church, and those who mainly sell rather than accumulate livestock all reported a higher propensity to kill carnivores. The future of carnivore conservation in this region depends on a better understanding of the nuances of human–carnivore conflict and a concerted effort to address appropriate cultural and community-level institutions, chiefly by providing economic benefits to local people who engage in positive conservation activities.","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2009.06.006","journal":null,"aid":268}

Allowing pastoralists access to PAs and their resources remains a contentious issue in southern Kenya, where retaliatory killing of African lions (Panthera leo) by Maasai pastoralists has caused a steep decline in the lion population, threatening local extinction. Previous studies that have shown that local people often have negative attitudes toward PAs; here PA policy during times of hardship is linked to attitudes toward lions and behavioural intentions. Different access policies to grazing inside Tsavo and Nairobi National Parks during the 2008/2009 drought influenced Maasai attitudes toward lions and their propensity to kill them. A semi-structured questionnaire (n = 206) and a multivariate model examine the relative importance of PA access and 11 additional predictors on individuals' attitudes and reported inclination to kill lions.

Introduction Indigenous knowledge is being used increasingly in traditional healing (Cox, 1999), biodiversity conservation (Xu et al., 2005a), forest management (Ramakrishnan, 2007), maintaining resilience of social–ecological systems (Berkes et al., 2000), and sustainable land use (Thapa et al., 1995) and livelihoods (Flavier et al., 1995). Its significance is widely recognized at the international level, for example in the Convention on Biological Diversity (Posey and Dutfield, 1996). A current challenge is the development of strategies to incorporate indigenous knowledge into state-driven conservation and development programmes. In developing countries , where rural communities are shifting from subsistence livelihoods to market-oriented economies, the role of indigenous knowledge in poverty alleviation is much debated (Ellen et al., 2000). While there are advocates for increased use, recognition, and preservation of traditional knowledge at national level, there are many questions about how to develop and adapt indigenous knowledge in the context of rapid technical, political, and economic change. Rich in cultural and biological diversity, Yunnan Province, known as the 'the roof of Southeast Asia', is home to 45 million people from 25 distinct ethnic minorities, most of them living between 1000 and 3000 masl. The Chinese government has a strong interest in political security in this mountain region and is also concerned about environmental impact on the economies of Yunnan and the surrounding provinces, all of which are affected by the headwaters of the Yangtze, Salween, Irrawaddy, Mekong, Black, Red, and Pearl rivers. A nationwide project, the Sloping Land Conversion Programme (SLCP) or 'Grain for Green' programme, was recently introduced to encourage on-farm afforestation on a large scale. By providing grain and cash subsidies to encourage farmers to plant trees on their croplands, the programme's main objective is to convert vast areas of steeply sloped agricultural land to forest or grassland, specifically targeting areas with slopes greater than 258. Although this initiative was originally in response to the hydrological instability of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, the project has spread beyond their immediate watersheds. The potential impact of the SLCP on indigenous people is great as it affects over 750,000 ha of cropland and more than 10 million mountain inhabitants (Xu and Wilkes, 2005). The programme has several other goals, ranging from erosion control and improvement of hydrological stability to poverty alleviation (Bennet, 2008). The government, however, has not incorporated indigenous forestrelated knowledge into species' selection, tree planting, and forest management in this programme (Xu and Ribot, 2004). Forest restoration and conservation policies are implemented from the top-down and often fail to recognize the diversity of indigenous A B S T R A C T Indigenous knowledge has become a topic of considerable interest within the research and development environment. Incorporating indigenous knowledge into state-led 'top-down' conservation and development programmes, however, is still a great challenge. This paper presents a case from Yunnan, Southwest China, in which indigenous knowledge has been integrated into the development of an agroforestry model with non-timber forest products for the Sloping Land Conservation Programme (SLCP) by using a participatory technology development (PTD) approach. This approach was adopted to increase the likelihood that technologies developed would be suitable for resource-poor households. It is expected that integrating indigenous and scientific knowledge, will lead to positive ecological and economic outcomes. Finally, the paper argues that the integration of indigenous knowledge in both forestry policy formulation and implementation is important in the context of sustainable forest management in mountain areas. ß 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In 2006, questionnaire based interviews were conducted quarterly of 290 randomly selected households in the buffer zone of the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique. We used the propensity score matching technique to assess the PES-project impacts on household cash income, consumption expenditure, forest resource use and crop yields. We found that, in contrast to nonparticipant households, PES-participant households earned more cash income, incurred more consumption expenditure, collected less forest products and, harvested lower quantities of agriculture crops. In addition, we found, through decomposition analysis, that there was a differential in PES income. Both male-headed and high-income households were being favoured as project benefit recipients. Future PES-projects should focus on a payment scheme that can better ensure the benefit to all the participant households and also pay extra attention on the benefits distribution to the vulnerable households.","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.08.014","journal":null,"aid":273}

Understanding the resource-use patterns of such communities provides a basis for seeking the participation of such communities in forest conservation. The present study undertaken in the Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary and the adjoining Sigur Plateau in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, addressed the importance of forests in the household economy of indigenous communities. Its main objective was to quantify the forest dependence of local people, and assess to what extent restrictive biodiversity conservation strategies would affect their livelihoods. These questions help in understanding the stake of the people in forest conservation strategies. Economic activities of the households were investigated in eight selected villages, four of which (proximal villages) had access to reserve forest areas where collection of forest products was allowed and were also located close to markets that provided opportunities to sell forest products. The remaining four villages (distal villages) were close to the Wildlife Sanctuary where the collection of forest products was not allowed and there was no access to organized markets. A total of 132 households were surveyed. The households both in proximal and distal villages were classified into three distinct income groups namely 'low', 'medium' and 'high', based on their gross annual income. Use of forest resources in Mudumalai was found to be influenced by multiple factors. In terms of livelihood of the traditional communities, livestock rearing and collection of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) were very important, the latter both for cash income and subsistence use. Peripheral communities used the forest resources in a varied fashion, with NWFPs contributing differently to different income groups. Where there was no restriction on forest use, higher income groups used the resources more heavily than lower income groups, and hence would suffer most from any restriction on forest use. People's reliance on forests evidently declined with increased level both of education and of opportunities in non-forestry vocations. Forests were still very important to the household economy of the local people both in terms of food security and cash income.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":272}

We found a high degree of conservation awareness, but most people expressed negative conservation attitudes and almost all lost crops to wildlife. We highlight the complexity of conflict in the area and present a basis for electing a microsite planning approach for conservation and development in areas characterized by high ethnic diversity, high human population densities, and land-dependent large mammals that pose economic risks. The findings imply that highly localized development schemes and participatory approaches to resource management at the village level, coupled with greater efforts at education, are especially needed to achieve conservation and development goals in such cases.","doi":"10.1007/s11111-009-0086-0","journal":{"name":"Popul Environ","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":274}

Secondly, we investigated disparities between three income groups. On average, income from NTFPs accounted for 39% of total household income and had a strong equalizing effect on it. However, the economic relevance of NTFPs differs between households: Poorer households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs in order to fulfill basic needs than wealthier households.

As a result, management of marine commons is inherently biased towards short-term interests of industrial fleets, rather than the long-term maintenance of coastal ecosystem health. Artisanal fishers' knowledge can provide practical information for management, and when shared, can help build trust between fishers and managers. However, until recently, very few studies designed to support fisheries management have incorporated fishers' knowledge. This study was designed to characterize the geography of fishing in the Gulf of Hon-duras (GOH), shared by Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras, from the perspective of artisanal fishers. Data were compiled from semi-formal interviews with key informants, community meetings, mapping exercises , workshops with fishers in the GOH during 1998–1999, and participant observations through July 2011. Data were used to document fishery landings, status and trends in marine resources, the spatial and the temporal dynamic geography of fishing, and fishers' suggestions for improved conservation and management. Many of these suggestions have been implemented in the GOH between 1999 and 2011.

D. and Stronza A.","dAbstract":"International conservation organisations have invested considerable resources in fostering biodiversity conservation programs in the humid tropics, the most biologically diverse areas on earth. Recent approaches to conservation have centered on integrated conservation and development projects and participatory resource management programs, co-managed between governments and local communities. But these programs have had only mixed success and often suffer from insuffi cient quantity or quality of participation by local communities. We pose that participatory resource management is more likely to succeed when community members, 1) gain a global perspective on how their social, economic and environmental conditions compare with peer communities in other similar areas of the world, and thus better understand issues of relative scarcity and the benefi ts of sustainable resource management, and 2) engage as decision-makers at every stage of the conservation process up to refl ective program evaluation. This paper examines the role of South-South exchanges as a tool to achieve these intermediate goals that ultimately foster more effective and participatory conservation and support sustainable local livelihoods. The data are extracted from the initiatives of the authors in two different environments—marine and coastal communities in Central America and the Caribbean, and lowland rainforest communities in the western Amazon of South America. We conclude that the exchanges are effective ways to build stakeholder comprehension about, and meaningful engagement in, resource management. South-South exchanges may also help build multi-local coalitions from various remote areas that together support biodiversity conservation at regional and global scales.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.83724","journal":null,"aid":282}

M.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION The world is facing a natural resource crisis (Acheson 2006) precipitated by natural, climatic, and anthropogenic stressors that are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity (Hughes et al. 2007, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007). A consequence of these pressures is a loss in the provision and value of the goods and services humans derive from natural ecosystems. These losses are often mediated by human motivation to manage for a few of the most profitable services, resulting in a loss in social, cultural, or ecological services. These trade-offs between less profitable cultural or ecosystem services and economic consumable services are likely to be nonlinear. For example, Barbier et al. (2008) found the economic value of shrimp production to peak at an intermediate level of mangrove conversion, suggesting it may be possible to maximize total economic value while minimizing ecological and cultural losses (Steffan-Dewenter et al. 2007, Hicks et al. 2008). As ecological functions and social features influence value, and they themselves are influenced by external features, correct identification of trade-offs is dependent on their incorporation into valuation studies. Social capital, for example, can alter whether or not a community is able to fully benefit from the goods and services present (Inkeles 2000). It is clear that to maintain the flow of goods and services, governance institutions need to integrate socioeconomic features with ecological processes to effectively manage biological resources (Ostrom 1990, Hughes et al. 2005, Wilson 2006, Ostrom 2007). Social–ecological systems theory provides a useful perspective for linking social and ecological domains (Andersson et al. 2007) but has frequently lacked integration with ecological economics. Ecological economics combines ecology and economics to help explain the effects of, and motivations for, human action on ecosystems (Costanza et al. 1997, Armsworth and Roughgarden 2001). As such, ecological economics provides a valuable tool to quantify the trade-offs in ecosystem goods and services that societies frequently make in choosing how to manage or exploit resources (Barbier et al. 2008). In this paper, we integrate ecological economics into a social–ecological systems perspective to quantify trade-offs in ecological goods and services associated with different social, ecological, and management conditions. As a case study, we use coral reef social–ecological systems in Kenya. Coral reefs provide crucial goods and services to some of the poorest, most densely populated, and growing human societies (Hughes et al. 2007), but are among the ecosystems most sensitive to disturbances (Bellwood et al. 2004). In response, various management measures have been developed to conserve and sustainably manage these ecosystems (McClanahan 2006). Comparison of social–ecological systems among such management scenarios provides an opportunity to assess trade-offs in ecosystem goods and services and the role social features play. We took advantage of three types of management systems associated with Kenyan coral reef fisheries to address the following research question: \" How do differing management systems and social conditions contribute to differing values for ecological goods and services, and are trade-offs apparent? \" To answer this question, we: (i) conducted a total economic valuation (TEV) of the coral reef fisheries associated with nine fish landing sites; (ii) identified the goods and services that were driving the economic values; (iii) examined relationships between eight key socioeconomic conditions and the ecosystem goods and services; and (iv) examined the detailed trends in sites and values in the absence of the dominant values.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":283}

Since Zimbabwe has been relatively successful in conserving its elephant population, but relatively unsuccessful in stopping rhino poaching, the paper concludes\" that the development of positive linkages between rural farmers and the state, which include heavy doses of popular participation at the grassroots level, is crucial for any successful natural resource policy.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Human Ecology, 11\"ol","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":285}

M.","dAbstract":"Attitudes of local people to wildlife, and particularly to large animals, are an increasingly important element of conservation work, but attitudes may vary within a community according to gender, and prior experience of wildlife. Data were collected by questionnaire and informal interviews with 59 men and 57 women living on the southern edge of the Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda, to assess the influence of these factors in attitudes towards elephants, in an area from which they are now absent, and to conservation in general. It was hypothesized that prior experience of elephants might influence people's perceptions of them, and that this in turn might influence their attitudes towards the issue of elephant conservation. The results of this study did not generally support this. There was no evidence that people with prior experience of elephants were any more likely to support their conservation than were people who did not have prior experience of them. Within this community men and women expressed very different views as to the behaviour of elephants. Women were more likely than men to report that elephants were dangerous, irrespective of whether they had seen an elephant or not. Locally, conservation was considered to be particularly important and beneficial as a strategy because it 'should help ensure protection of people and their crops from marauding elephants and other animals'. Attitudes to, and expectations of, conservation as a strategy also varied between members of this community with respect to gender, but age and ethnic group were not good predictors of whether people were likely to be supportive of conservation issues or not.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":284}

A. and Rowcliffe †. J. and Koldewey H. J. and Milner-Gulland E. J.","dAbstract":"Alternative occupations are frequently promoted as a means to reduce the number of people exploiting declining fisheries. However, there is little evidence that alternative occupations reduce fisher numbers. Seaweed farming is frequently promoted as a lucrative alternative occupation for artisanal fishers in Southeast Asia. We examined how the introduction of seaweed farming has affected village-level changes in the number of fishers on Danajon Bank, central Philippines, where unsustainable fishing has led to declining fishery yields. To determine how fisher numbers had changed since seaweed farming started, we interviewed the heads of household from 300 households in 10 villages to examine their perceptions of how fisher numbers had changed in their village and the reasons they associated with these changes. We then asked key informants (people with detailed knowledge of village members) to estimate fisher numbers in these villages before seaweed farming began and at the time of the survey. We compared the results of how fisher numbers had changed in each village with the wealth, education, seaweed farm sizes, and other attributes of households in these villages, which we collected through interviews, and with village-level factors such as distance to markets. We also asked people why they either continued to engage in or ceased fishing. In four villages, respondents thought seaweed farming and low fish catches had reduced fisher numbers, at least temporarily. In one of these villages, there was a recent return to fishing due to declines in the price of seaweed and increased theft of seaweed. In another four villages, fisher numbers increased as human population increased, despite the widespread uptake of seaweed farming. Seaweed farming failed for technical reasons in two other villages. Our results suggest seaweed farming has reduced fisher numbers in some villages, a result that may be correlated with socioeconomic status, but the heterogeneity of outcomes is consistent with suggestions that alternative occupations are not a substitute for more direct forms of resource management. Interacción entre el Cultivo de Algas Marinas como una Ocupación Alternativa y el Número de Pescadores en Filipinas Central Resumen: Las ocupaciones alternativas a menudo son promovidas como un medio para reducir el número de personas que explotan las pesquerías en declinación. Sin embargo, hay poca evidencia de que las ocupa-ciones alternativas reducen el número de pescadores. El cultivo de algas marinas frecuentemente es promovido †Current address: Hill et al. 325 como una ocupación alternativa lucrativa para pescadores artesanales en el sureste de Asia. Examinamos el efecto de la introducción del cultivo de algas marinas sobre cambios a nivel de poblado en el número de pescadores en el Banco Danajon, Filipinas central, donde la pesca no sustentable ha llevado a la declinación de la producción pesquera. Para determinar como ha cambiado el número de pescadores desde que comenzó el cultivo de algas marinas, entrevistamos a las cabezas de familia de 300 viviendas en 10 poblados para examinar sus percepciones de cómo ha cambiado el número de pescadores en su poblado y las razones que se asocian con ese cambio. También entrevistamos a informantes clave (personas con conocimiento detallado de los miembros del poblado) para estimar el número de pescadores en esos poblados antes de que comen-zara el cultivo de algas marinas y al momento del estudio. Comparamos los resultados de los cambios en el número de pescadores en cada poblado con la riqueza, educación, tamaño de las granjas de algas marinas y otros atributos de las viviendas en esos poblados, que fueron recolectados mediante entrevistas, y con factores a nivel de poblado como la distancia al mercado. También le preguntamos a la gente porque continuaba involucrada en actividades pesqueras o había dejado de pescar. Los encuestados en cuatro poblados pensaron que el cultivo de algas marinas y la disminución de la captura de peces han reducido el número de pescadores, por lo menos temporalmente. En uno de esos poblado, hubo un retorno reciente a la pesca debido a declina-ciones en el precio de algas marinas y el incremento en robo de algas. En otros cuatro poblados, el número de pescadores incrementó con el aumento de la población humana, no obstante la amplia aceptación del cultivo de algas marinas. El cultivo de algas falló por razones técnicas en otros dos poblados. Nuestros resultados sugieren que el cultivo de algas marinas han reducido el número de pescadores en algunos poblados, un resultado que se puede correlacionar con el estatus socioeconómico, pero la heterogeneidad de los resultados es consistente con sugerencias de que las ocupaciones alternativas no son un sustituto de formas más directas de manejo de recursos.

The case of Taita Hills, Kenya","authors":"Himberg N. and Omoro L. and Pellikka P. and Luukkanen O.","dAbstract":"Introduction The Rio Earth Summit (UNCED 1992) and the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD 2002) have elaborated on the need for environmental conservation, sustainable development and the integration of local participation. Subsequently, many countries have implemented strategies to address these concerns. Some of these strategies include the enactment of new legislation , the provision of incentives and the restructuring of the forestry sector (GoK 1994; GRN 1996; GRN 2001; RoK 2005). New concepts in forest management hitherto unknown in conventional forestry, such as participatory forestry, community forestry (Selener 1997; Saxena et al. 2001) and joint forest management (Misra 1997 ), have developed and been incorporated into forest policies and legislation. In the early 1990s, development agencies introduced participatory forest management in sub-Saharan Africa (Matose & Wily 1996; Salomao & Matose 2007 ) with the key objective that the governments that own and administer most of the forest resources (White & Martin 2002 ) would devolve powers to local communities. In the process, governments would improve forest management practices (Andersson et al. 2006 ) or institute ownership and rights over natural resources (Potters et al. 2001). In participatory forestry, such decentrali-Nina Himberg, Loice Omoro, Petri Pellikka and Olavi Luukkanen sation would presumably enable communities to manage their natural resources in an efficient, equitable and sustainable manner (Agrawal & Ribot 1999; Blaikie 2006 ). The key element in this assumption is that the government devolves powers to local communities to fully manage the forests. Unfortunately, this rarely occurs; the local communities to whom such powers are purportedly devolved are seldom allowed to dispose of the productive forest resources, nor are they able to resolve divergent interests between actors and institutions with which they interact (Agrawal & Ribot 1999). However, other development workers suggest that decentralisation functions differently depending on the types of powers that are decentralised (Ribot 2002) and that in specific contexts, decentralisation functions well when systems for accountability and resource transfer are in place (Agrawal & Ribot 1999; Andersson et al. 2006). The involvement of communities in forest resource management is considered a way of increasing democratisation process (Nygren 2005), particularly when the communities elect their representatives and establish local institutions to make specific decisions. Such representations are also considered signs of democracy (Ribot 2006). Community participation in forestry in Kenya is outlined in the Forest Act (RoK 2005). Like most government-instituted policies that outline agenda and activities for implementation (Agrawal & Gupta 2005 ), the Act defines membership, activities to be undertaken and penalties. In reference to the forests under study, which are remnants of the Eastern Arc Mountains and rated among the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots (Conservation International 2005 ), the management priorities include preservation and conservation (Mwang'ombe 2005a). The provisions of the Act require that the communities define management objectives and prepare management plans for approval. In so doing, the community's powers are limited since their plans must conform to the government's desires. This only confirms the observations of Agrawal and Ribot (1999) on devolutions in which communities are seldom permitted to exploit the resources of the forests for either commercial or domestic utilisation . Instead, such communities are allowed to institute reforestation activities using only indigenous tree species, or to set up activities, such as apiaries, butterfly farming or resin tapping, which do not threaten the wellbeing of the forest. In effect , no powers are devolved; rather, the people engaged in forest activities are granted access, but with no rights over the use of resources. Restrictions such as in these forests fail to conform to the spirit of community forestry which, according to Agrawal and Gupta (2005), should enhance the participation of stakeholders in decision-making and in the accrual of benefits associated with a common forestry resource. In this case, the people engaged in forest activities safeguard the interests of the government by preserving the forest while making no decisions whatsoever about its management . On the other hand, participation means different things to different people. Arnstein (1969) differentiated participation into eight levels ranging from low participation, where manipulation is commonplace, to high participation, where control rests in the hands of citizens. He thus refers to participation as the power of degree to which the actors control decision-making. After Kenya's independence, the pre-independence laws governing all the major forests carried over. Forest management entailed the enforcement , through policing and punitive actions, of laws to prevent illegal activities. Such management led to widespread conflicts between the people and the Forest Department as more forest reserves were being created amid the rising population . To allay the rising discontent and conflict, the government had to introduce changes in the forestry sector. The changes were effectively instituted in the 1990s even though Kenya had previously adopted the District Focus for Rural Development (DFRD) strategy (GoK 1983) where government departments adopted a policy of decentralisation. This strategy, however, dwelt on the administrative aspects of the government in which local communities were uninvolved. In what can best be described as the diffusion of administrative services (Agrawal & Ribot 1999; Oyugi 2000), the powers of the central government were devolved to appointees of the central government, namely to government departments in districts that aimed at bringing development closer to the people, and thus improving the delivery of services, local development and management (Oyugi 2000). Already in 1975, elements of local participation were initiated, but solely on private lands (Burley 1982). In 1994, the government initiated the Kenya Forestry Master Plan (KFMP), which spelt out the need for reform in forest policy and legislation as well as the importance of involving communities in forest management (GoK 1994; Luukkanen 1996). Subsequently, in 2005, Kenya enacted a new Forest Act. Under the Act, the Director of For-The benefits and constraints of participation in forest … estry can confer upon communities all or some rights to the forest provided that such communities are registered as associations and apply for permission to participate in the management of state or local forests. In Taita Hills, the indigenous forests are important sources of water for the surrounding community as well as for those living in the lowlands further downstream. The agricultural sector employs a majority of the people compared with only five per cent of those engaged in forestry-related activities (RoK 2008). The increasing population and declining land holding sizes, without a corresponding expansion of alternative economic activities , are considered major threats to sustainable resource management (Mogaka 2002). The aim of this study is to offer insight into local people's perceptions about benefits and constraints of participation in forest management in Taita Hills, during the transformation of the forest policy. The people organised into forest conservation groups and residing adjacent to Ngangao, Chawia, Mbololo and Mwambirwa forests, were the subjects of this study. Through facilitating participatory rural appraisal exercises and a questionnaire study we identified factors motivating and hindering the conservation and livelihood enhancement efforts of our respondents during the early stages of policy imple- mentation.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Fennia","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":287}

The paper has transverse application to similar large energy projects in third word countries where construction might impact sensitive ecosystems. The Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) was developed in line with international standards and also to empathise with the objectives of the draft Yemeni biodiversity strategy and action plan. In addition, the company carried out biodiversity baseline survey, environmental and social impact assessment studies which translated into two World Bank compliant environmental and social management plans (ESMP) for the construction and operation phase of the project. The BAP describes the biodiversity status of Balhaf and the surrounding coastal area, setting targets for ecological conservation and outlining the mechanisms for achieving these targets, in addition to developing dynamic indicators, which will help to identify any beneficial effects. The BAP also contributes to the conservation of Yemeni biodiversity beyond the affected area. Furthermore, it deals with biodiversity and related socioeconomic aspects which will be implemented during construction, and longer term protection of biodiversity during the operation phase, in addition to promoting scientific development research and capacity building. Following pre-construction surveys, the little known coastline was discovered to be rich in very sensitive and diverse corals which play an important habitat role, contributing to the local artisanal fisheries, and a prime resource in this impoverished region. Nevertheless, Yemen lacks any specific legislation relating to biodiversity preservation, which would mandate significant new projects to develop a specific biodiversity management strategy. However, due to the ecological sensitivity of the site, Yemen LNG decided to voluntarily put in place a biodiversity action plan which is directed towards the conservation and sustainable development of biodiversity and the economic livelihood of local fisheries","doi":"10.1007/s00338-008-0371-x","journal":{"name":"the SPE International Conference on Health","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":289}

Results highlight significant general and comparative differences in fishermen's attitudes and perceptions based on socio-cultural structures of communities, occupation and role in local decision-making. The level of cultural survival in communities was a strong indicator for different priorities and attitudes. Differences were also evident based on the level of marine resources used for income generation. Participation in local decision-making processes had positive impacts on levels of knowledge and information, and fostered critical thinking among participants. In addition, the results also denoted that conservation and development were more effective in the long term if the host population could develop strategies and plans for biodiversity conservation.

Given that bamboo shoots provided the main cash income source, this had a major impact on household income and livelihoods. Changes to culm management and pest control practices are recommended which could significantly increase shoot productivity and income, while improving bamboo's contribution to rural livelihoods and its role in targeted poverty alleviation.

This study of Five Blues Lake National Park in central Belize explored attitudes towards ecotourism and conservation of local people living adjacent to and co-managing a national park. The authors conducted attitudinal surveys of residents of Saint Margarets village in 1995 and in 2003. The data suggested high levels of support for ecotourism development and continued protection of the land and conservation efforts. Despite this support, by 2003, most ecotourism activities and park management had been curtailed. Although the inception of co-managed ecotourism was received well and some level of interest existed, over time, there was a decline in community participation and ecotourism activities. This is attributable to factors including resident apathy, low community participation, diminished financial resources, insufficient local and national management capacity, and perceptions of few personal benefits by residents. Furthermore, the often claimed theoretical benefits of ecotourism in developing communities were not fully realised in this case. As demonstrated by this study, local involvement of residents in development and implementation of ecotourism initiatives, including necessary capacity-building, may help ensure sustainable management and success of long-term ecotourism and conservation efforts.","doi":"10.1080/14724049.2010.529910","journal":null,"aid":295}

Instead, logistic regression analysis identified material and land wealth as variables that increase households' interest in accessing wood resources in the Park, whereas intent to move in the near future and the interaction of material and land wealth were negative influences.

A.","dAbstract":"In 1995, the government of the Republic of South Africa launched the Working for Water (WfW) programme that links environmental and developmental goals through the removal of high water-consuming alien plants with pro-poor rural employment opportunities. Whilst bio-physical evaluations have widely reported on the hydrological, ecological and conservation components of the programme, there exists growing uncertainty over the programme's role as a poverty reduction mechanism. This paper evaluates three projects in the Luvuvhu catchment, Limpopo Province, against five socioeconomic workfare criteria and the underlying biophysical rationale. Results show that asset creation from incre-mental streamflow is economically efficient and is likely to improve significantly if biodiversity benefits, community harvesting of riparian goods and services, ecological non-use values and seasonal water demand values are incorporated into the analysis. However, socioeconomic benefits are more questionable: poverty targeting is weak with wage rates failing to self-select the poor; a minor proportion (0.5%) of catchment households benefit from the highly-valued employment opportunities; high variability in monthly employment causes financial difficulties for labourers; labourers are not 'empowered' as is evi-denced by the failure of the 2-year exit strategy; and programme efficiency is high in proportional allocation of cash-flow to non-management wage labour. It is concluded that the Working for Programme is a potentially replicable model in other semi-arid contexts in developing countries if based on its core biophysical remit but is a transitory and limited poverty reduction mechanism for improving rural livelihoods .","doi":"10.1007/s10668-005-1780-4","journal":null,"aid":298}

M. and Gilmore M. P. and Endress B. A.","dAbstract":"In this study, we sought to better understand the social, economic, and ecological factors influencing the development of sustainable management practices for Mauritia flexuosa (aguaje) in two Maijuna indigenous communities. Focus groups, semi-structured interviews and household surveys were conducted to document current and historical patterns of aguaje harvest and management, the importance of aguaje to household income, and to identify current harvesting strategies and key perceptions regarding management. This was complemented with ecological sampling in 12 aguaje stands to determine population abundance, population structure, and sex ratio. Results indicated that M. flexuosa stands show clear evidence of past over-exploitation, with a current sex ratio of 3.48 males for each female, and low adult female densities (21 females/ha). Despite this, M. flexuosa remains highly abundant and populations maintain an inverted J-curve structure; however, results also showed a significant relationship between low densities of adult females and low densities of seedlings (R 2 = 0.476; p = 0.013), suggesting that the felling of females from the canopy is reducing recruitment rates. The current state of M. flexuosa populations corroborates the harvest history as told by interviewees that intensive destructive harvesting began in the 1990s and has since waned, primarily due to the decline in the stock of females and low prices. Attempts at non-destructive harvesting, via the use of climbing harnesses has had mixed success as nearly half of the M. flexuosa palms harvested in 2010 were cut down rather than climbed. Scarcity of adult females and low prices resulted in low return on effort, and current income from aguaje accounts for just 5% of the communities' cash income. Results indicated that four factors synergistically interact to hinder development of sustainable aguaje management: (1) low resource stock, (2) market barriers, including poor market access and low prices, (3) limited access to climbing technology and training, and (4) limited organizational experience at a community level, which limits the effectiveness of attempts to mitigate the first three barriers. Despite these challenges, the Maijuna and aguaje have many attributes associated with successful management of natural resources. Our study suggests that in cases where forest resources have already been degraded, transitioning to more sustainable management alternatives can be difficult as a number of ecological and socioeconomic factors interact to hinder implementation.","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2011.11.040","journal":null,"aid":299}

Kanak villagers viewed \" conservation \" largely as a means of reinforcing their cultural identity through preservation of their cultural heritage, grounded in the landscape. However, at the same time, they hoped to promote economic development. Ironically, thus, they found it necessary to welcome outside influences—to seek visits from non-Kanak tourists and to request financial and technical support from the provincial government, which had been created by the colonial power. Meanwhile, although a desire to reinforce customary authority structures formed an important part of this search for a unifying cultural identity, the quest for a stable, traditional, shared \" past \" created new, micropolitical instabilities within the community, conditioned by expectations of financial gain and by sources of social status. A \" micropolitical ecology \" approach revealed that a conservation program grounded in customary authority would be the only acceptable solution, although it would be difficult for villagers to agree on who filled customary roles. This study indicates the importance of gaining a clear understanding of intra-community dynamics and of community members' perceptions of external groups, in order to design appropriate strategies for co-management.","doi":"10.1016/j.soscij.2008.03.005","journal":{"name":"The Social Science Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":301}
{"filename":"Horton 2009","year":2009,"title":"Buying Up Nature: Economic and Social Impacts of Costa Rica's Ecotourism Boom","authors":"Horton L. R.","dAbstract":"DEBATES ON ECOTOURISM Ceballos-Lascuráin first defined ecotourism as \" traveling to relatively undisturbed or uncontaminated natural areas with the specific objective of studying, admiring, and enjoying the scenery and its wild plants and animals, as well as any existing cultural manifestations \" (quoted in Fennell, 1999: 30). In contrast to mass tourism, associated with packaged trips by large groups and a preponderant role for transnational corporations, ecotourism is characterized as flexible, small-scale, responsible activities in natural environments carried out by individuals or small groups (Mowforth and Munt, 2004). In practice, however, the lines may blur, as roughly half of visitors to Costa Rica fall under the definition of \" soft \" ecotourists, traditional \" sun and sand \" mass tourists who also make excursions to natural destinations (Honey, 1999; Zamora and Obando, 2001). North American and European ecotourists who visit Costa Rica are relatively well-educated and affluent—one survey found that 68 percent hold college degrees and 36 percent have incomes over $100,000 (Cheong and Miller, 2000; Tico Times, 2002). They seek a temporary escape from mundane and stressful lifestyles in industrial societies and the experience of novelty and authenticity through consumption of Third World tourist destinations like Costa Rica (Mowforth and Munt, 2004). Ideally, ecotourists, with their commitment to the environment and social justice, should be culturally sensitive, minimal-impact visitors who model and impart to local peoples positive environmental values in relationships that move beyond subject/object dichotomies to create spaces of egalitarian interaction and self-development (Cheong and Miller, 2000). Supporters also argue that ecotourism provides income and control for local communities, builds environmental awareness, generates direct and indirect financial benefits for conservation, revitalizes local cultures, and strengthens human rights and democratic movements (Fennell, 1999; Honey, 1999). Other scholars are skeptical, however, that ecotourism represents a qualitatively different or preferable form of development (Duffy, 2002; Mowforth and Munt, 2004; Robinson, 2003). Critics contend that despite its more laudable environmental and social intentions, ecotourism, like mass tourism, is still driven by the dynamics of capital accumulation and does not seriously challenge systems of power and unequal accumulation (Duffy, 2002; Mowforth and Munt, 2004). Rather, it is seen as a transnational activity compatible with and even advancing processes of corporate-dominated economic globalization (Robinson, 2003 ). Although ecotourism is conceptualized as smallscale and locally controlled, in practice it may become little more than a marketing ploy as economic concentration and corporate influence within the ecotourism sector increase (Duffy, 2002; Honey, 1999). In sociocultural terms, critics contend that status-seeking Northern \" egotourists \" may be particularly intrusive and disruptive of local cultures precisely because they seek out more remote and \" untouched \" travel destinations (Duffy, 2002; Mowforth and Munt, 2004).","doi":"10.1177/0094582X09334299","journal":null,"aid":302}

M.","dAbstract":"This paper examines conflicts over land and resources in Nicaragua's Bosawhs rainforest reserve between Mestizos and Mayangna Indian people. Mestizos are people of mixed Indian and European descent who speak Spanish and do not consider themselves to be Indians. Bosaw~is is one of the last refuges of the Mayangna indigenous group and is also the largest area of protected tropical rainforest in Central America. The Mayangna village of Sikilta, in the North Atlantic Autonomous Region, is used to illustrate the nature of land conflicts in the region. Such conflicts-between economic development and conservation, between livelihoods and conservation, and between peasant livelihoods and indigenous territorial rights-are symptomatic of rainforest areas in other parts of the world. Land conflicts in Bosawhs are examined within the broader economic, political and institutional context. Potential solutions to land conflict in Sikilta are explored. The paper illustrates the complexities surrounding the demarcation and upholding of indigenous land rights. It highlights the institutional complexities and weaknesses which have allowed Sikilta's land problem to go unresolved. It is argued that until national problems of unequal access to land and unsustainable forms of forest use are addressed, communities like Sikilta will continue to suffer invasion of their land.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Bull.

We carried out 250 semi-structured interviews in eight villages. The effectiveness of the campaign was assessed using change in opinion over the previous 3 years as an attitudinal indicator and amount pledged for saiga conservation as a measure of behavioural intention. The campaign induced positive changes in attitudes and behavioural intention. Reinforcement was important, with people's retention of information about saiga conservation from the campaign being positively correlated with their level of ecological knowledge about the species. Similarly, behavioural intention towards the saiga was more likely to be positive in individuals who had a high level of exposure to the species and/or had been subject to two or more different conservation interventions. Level of attitudinal change was dependent on an interaction between the date when the media campaign was carried out and the age of the respondent. We conclude that public awareness campaigns, if designed to take into account the socio-demographics and cultural background of the target audience, can be an effective method of improving attitudes towards conservation .","doi":"10.1017/S0030605311001025","journal":null,"aid":304}

This research reports the first population-based survey on Taiwanese public knowledge, attitudes, and actions on marine-related issues. The stratified random sampling by county was completed with 1,120 telephone respondents from October to December 2010. More than 60% of the respondents have heard about global warming, sea-level rising, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the coral reef bleaching crisis, and Japan whaling fisheries. However, less than 20% of the respondents are aware of Taiwanese domestic marine policies, such as the Ocean White Paper. On resources conservation, 74.7% of the respondents support the bluefin tuna catches regulations and 76.6% agree that the shark fin fisheries will impact shark resources. Education and age are the major affecting variables for resource conservation and knowledge. Higher education and age 40–49 are most supportive of conservation measures. For marine recreational activities, 42.2% of the respondents can swim, and 44.2% of the respondents had not visited the beach in the previous year. The results suggest that the government could establish a specialized agency to strengthen its marine policy and take more actions to protect ocean environment and conserve marine resources. To encourage more Taiwanese to participate in ocean recreational activities, the government could build a safe facility for marine recreation, cooperate with the private sectors in education, and provide outreach to raise public awareness of the oceans.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Coastal Management Coastal Management","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":306}

It consists of series of forest restoration projects that aim to address severe soil and water losses, and improve farmer's livelihoods. To assess the effectiveness of the program, systematic planning, integrated research and comprehensive monitoring were used to illustrate how forest restoration projects that consider both ecological, social and economic perspectives can improve both the environment and society, and eradicate the \" ecological-poverty trap \". We found that the overall ecological effects of the program are beneficial, and the socioeconomic effects are mostly positive. Forest plantations covering 4.92 × 10 6 ha were established, which promoted increased forest coverage from a minimum of 26.98% to 60.05% at present. The amount of carbon storage in forest increased significantly, with net carbon seques-tration of plantation forests increased from 2.29 TgC/year to 10.52 TgC/year. The results also indicated that the area of land affected by heavy and severe soil erosion has decreased by 55.2% and 53.6%, respectively, while the water holding capacity was 25.2% higher in 2009 than that in 1990. The net income for farmers was almost 6 times greater than that before the program, and the number of people living below the poverty line decreased from 10 million to 0.865 million. This assessment has confirmed that if we cannot improve the livelihood of local communities and encourage them to participate in such programs, we will be unable to restore and manage degraded environments. The continuing and future impacts of the program may be even greater, and will provide important lessons and experiences for other ecological restoration programs.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Ecological Engineering","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":959}

Subsequently, there is often an increased presence of cheetahs on farmland, causing farmers to perceive cheetahs as deadly livestock threats; consequently, cheetahs are indiscriminately shot, poisoned, or trapped and killed (Durant, 2000; Marker, 2003; Marker, 2006; Muntifering et al., 2006). Conversely, in some areas cheetahs are appreciated as a tourism asset. In Otijwarongo, the \" Cheetah Capital of the World \" (Marker, 2003, p. (CCF) 1 to experience cheetahs up-close and personal. Though cheetah tourism can help support local economy and generate funds to assist in cheetah conservation, economically valuing cheetahs has, to some extent, resulted in their exploitation. For example, CCF reported occasionally confiscating cubs from farmers attempting to tout them as tourist attractions; these cubs frequently suffer from malnutrition and other injustices, and often die (Personal communication, September 20, 2008). Combining farmer persecution, habitat loss, degradation, and removing breeding females and new offspring from the wild cheetah population has put the long-term survival of cheetahs at risk. To combat this, CCF conducts scientific research, applied management, and provides training and other educational opportunities to Namibian and international visitors with the aim of increasing awareness and understanding of the cheetah's significance to Namibia's ecosystems (CCF, 2011; Wigley, 2000). In my study, I wanted to learn how storytelling could be used to explore the perceptions school-aged children from farming families or communities held of cheetahs. It was my thought that if CCF had a better understanding of what children's perceptions of cheetahs were, prior to experiencing their education program, the program could be revisioned to provide learning opportunities that addressed possible misunderstandings or negative perceptions about cheetahs, in order to help ensure successful goal attainment (Thomson & Hoffman, 2003).","doi":"10.1080/1533015X.2013.838870","journal":null,"aid":310}

A.","dAbstract":"Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification has been promoted as a way to encourage and recognize community-based forest enterprises (CFEs). However, certification has proved more difficult for CFEs than expected, and few certified operations have achieved the highly anticipated market benefits of certification. This has led to questioning of the compatibility of certification with CFEs, though few studies have directly asked local CFE actors their perceptions on this issue. This study investigates perceptions of certification for two CFEs in Brazil's western Amazon. The specific objectives of this study were (1) to determine the positive and negative aspects of certification as perceived by community members, their principal support organizations, and other key stakeholders, (2) to identify the relative importance of these perceived positive and negative aspects, and (3) to analyze the differences in perceptions between actors. Data were collected through structured interviews and a review of pertinent documents. Overall, the most positive aspects were economic and social, and the most negative aspects concerned the certification process and, to a lesser extent, the associated economic expenditures. Community members typically scored the positive aspects higher and the negative aspects lower than the support organizations. This is likely due to differences in roles and vantage points of these actors. In general, informants agreed that positive aspects of certification outweighed negative ones. This stands in contrast to some communities in other parts of Latin America that are contemplating dropping certification. Two particular conditions may have enabled operations in this study to overcome common constraints for CFEs: (1) membership in a regional producers group, and (2) strong political, technical, and financial support from the state government. Their experiences specifically highlight the need to adapt the certification process for CFEs and demonstrate that obtaining market benefits is possible. #","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2006.07.027","journal":null,"aid":311}

In 2002, a participatory management process was designed to restore this forest. Although the project managers and local communities agreed to a plan at the beginning of the process, the plan was not implemented because confl ict arose in the course of the process. In this paper, an interactional framing approach was used to analyse the emergence of this confl ict, which ended in an impasse. This study showed that the confl ict was constructed and evolved mainly in stakeholders' discourses, even without changes in actual forest management and use. Moreover, it became clear that stakeholders constructed different frames in different conversation contexts: stakeholders, who share a set of perceptions, norms, and expectations as constructed and expressed in their talks (we-groups), constructed stereotypes and stigmas, blaming the other party and presenting themselves as innocent victims. In conversations involving all stakeholders, people did not reveal their real thoughts, either about each other or about the proposals for confl ict resolution. This study shows the relevance and agency of discourse in confl ict, and the importance of the interactional framing approach in understanding participatory management, and confl ict dynamics. It reveals how by means of discourses, farmers in the Agoua Forest succeeded in handling the confl ict, with the effect that little has been done in the project's decision to implement the plan.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.83722","journal":null,"aid":318}

Around half of the forests of the country occur in the coastal zone. People extract various goods and services from the mangroves. Nevertheless the mangrove forests are depleting. Although the extent of the Sundarbans forest has not changed much, its decline is of a qualitative nature. Mangrove plantations are increasing in area but they are losing growing stock. To arrest this, Bangladesh has adopted several strategies. The 'Sustainable Ecosystem Management' strategy has now been adopted instead of the 'Sustained Yield Principle'. Biodiversity conservation and enhancement has been taken as a key management goal. A zoning system is being developed for both production and protection purposes. The government facilitates alternative income for the local people by generating activities for the communities which are dependent on the forest. Different non-governmental organizations collaborate with the government in reducing the local people's dependence on the forest. Coastal plantations are erected to protect people from cyclones and to make the land more suitable for habitation. Through this greening of the coastal belt tree plantation is encouraged in coastal villages. Coastal embankments are being planted and leased to poor settlers in exchange for routine maintenance of the embankments. Plantations on newly accreted mud flats help in stabilizing the land, which can later on be settled by victims of erosion elsewhere. These adopted management measures do not only contribute to forestry resource management but also to the social, environmental and economic wellbeing of the coastal communities.

Through 110 household interviews and seven group discussions, an assessment was conducted of peoples' perception about major flora and fauna of the mangrove ecosystem, benefits derived from the forest, present condition of the forest, causes of degradation, and ways to improve the situation. Around one-fourth of the respondents mentioned that they were highly dependent on the ecosystem. The most important perceived benefits were: provision of raw materials, prevention against natural disasters, climate regulation and soil retention. However, the majority (>80%) of the respondents perceived the ecosystem to be degrading. Encroachment and illicit felling were identified as the main causes of such degradation. In order to arrest the continued degradation allowed by conventional forest management flaws, adaptive co-management has been recommended to conserve this ecosystem in a more equitable way.","doi":"10.1007/s11273-007-9060-8","journal":null,"aid":320}

In the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area (KCA), Nepal, livestock depredation by snow leopards impacts on yak herders' livelihoods. Retaliatory killings of snow leopard by the herders have been reported and the concerned authorities recently initiated snow leopard conservation programmes. In 2001, interviews with the yak herders who used the pastures in the Ghunsa valley in the preceding year collected data on the incidence of livestock death caused by snow leopards. The annual net cash income of the yak herders was estimated by obtaining baseline values of sales and expenditure per livestock head through field measurement of dairy products and interviews with a sample of herders. As yet, the average annual damage does not appear to have adversely affected fundamental livelihoods in households with an average herd size (36.6 head). However, in the worst scenario of livestock depredation, households with medium or small-sized herds (<40 head) might risk their living conditions becoming unsustainable or having to withdraw from yak pastoralism. A supplementary interview showed that the majority of the herders, except those who took completely neutral attitudes towards the regional conservation and development programme, had negative views of the snow leopard conservation policy. For the snow leopard conservation programme in the KCA to be a success, there must be a system to compensate the herders' households for livestock damage.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892904001778","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":322}

Reducing forest dependency helps in-situ conservation of biodiversity thereby conserving forest resources. This paper presents evidence of income diversification and its effects on forest resource extraction by rural communities living in forest margins. Diversified income sources of typical households include crop farming, off-farm employment , animal husbandry, home gardening and extraction of non-timber forest products and fuel-wood. The calculated mean indexes of diversification for the households in forest margins under investigation were 2.53, 2.57, 2.19 and 2.25. Results of the analysis show that the income diversification index had a negative and significant effect on dependency of rural households on forest resource extraction for three forest reserves. A positive relation between the index of income diversification and total income indicates an increase in household income due to increasing diversification income sources. However, given the complex nature of protecting natural forests, income diversification should be part of a broader integrated policy goal to protect natural forests.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":323}

{"filename":"Isaacs and Hara 2008","year":2008,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"Introduction The new democracy and the new constitution paved the way to formulate and implement the new fisheries law, the Marine Living Resources Act (MLRA). This law firmly entrenched the goals of transformation and redistribution of fishing rights in South Africa, thereby creating an action space for all South Africans to apply for fishing rights. The law, however, had a dialectical nature—while it enabled the target actors to apply for fishing rights, it also constrained them. The rules and regulations that were set to form organizations or entities were beyond the level of skills and capacities of many of the target actors. At the same time, the shift in the government's macroeconomic strategy from the reconstruction and development (RDP) to growth employ-ment and redistribution (GEAR), which focused on job creation and employment, restricted any mass redistribution of fishing rights and opened the door for litigations by the established industry, and also resulted in streamlining community organizations into closed corporations and private companies. Not only did this have the effect the action space for the poor, it also made the arena contested or a site of struggle where the dominant discourse of GEAR was set on creating new entrepreneurs with the intention that it would have trickle-down effects in the community with regard to job creation and employment . The entrepreneurs and the established companies, both competing for the same fishing rights, dominated the contested arena or action space. The entrepreneurs legitimized their role in the action space arena through the political transformation in the fishing industry. Since the goals relating to transformation in the fishing industry were so vague, these entrepreneurs technically formed part of the target group. The established industry legitimized their role by transforming their companies through shareholding schemes, change in ownership by bringing on board Black economic empowerment groups and through joint venture agreements. In the end, the legitimate target actors (marginalized poor) found themselves outside this action space. The action space became a site of struggle between the established industry and the organizational entrepreneurs, with the dominant discourse favoring business. On the one side were the ambitious entrepreneurs who usually lacked credit, business skills and infrastructure while on the other side were the mighty established industry with all the skills and infrastructure competing for the same limited resources. The state entered the action space by reinforcing the dominant discourse of favoring business above charity (job creation , creating stability in the industry, and creating employment) on the one hand, while on the other hand it wanted to show that it was doing the right thing by reinforcing its political goals of transforming the industry. The race and gender complement of established industry became the mainstream transformation agenda while the marginalized poor were catered for in the subsistence category to address poverty alleviation in fishing commu- nities. This paper analyses the attempts involved in transforming the fishing industry. It is divided into three main parts. The first part looks at why transformation of South African fishing industry. The second part focuses on policy processes and actions meant to redistribute and transform the fisheries. The last part discusses the rationale for Individual Transferable Quotas what the key features of redistribution in two sectors that were meant to benefit those marginalized coastal settlements.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"American Fisheries Society Symposium","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":325}

These maps were digitized and compared to satellite images from the same years. Trends and discrepancies between the two sets of maps were then analysed and discussed with the villagers in order to establish the local land-use history. The involvement of local groups in the mapping process was instrumental in overcoming long-standing inter-village conflicts, mainly by creating a common knowledge platform on which co-management could be based.

In the context of intellectual property, biodiversity is reduced to the chemical compounds, genes and proteins produced by plants, insects, microorganisms and macroorganisms that can be formulated into commodities . Biopiracy—politely called bioprospecting—appropriates local knowledge of the attributes of native plants and animals. Indigenous species identified as having valuable traits are collected and shipped to laboratories for modification by pharmaceutical, medical and agricultural companies. In this way, Western science transforms nature's bounty into commodities of global economic value. Biopiracy is labelled sustainable development and justified by global financial institutions like the World Trade Organization, Global Environment Facility, and World Intellectual Property Organization. However, deep political and ethical controversies challenge the morality of this concept. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission defined sustainable development as that which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the needs of future generations, an innocuous and positive-sounding goal. But in practice, the discourse of sustainable development is being used to impose economic globalization on poor countries, ostensibly to rescue them from their poverty, even in the most remote areas of the world. 1 Local populations are viewed as an inconvenience , while the cause of environmental degradation—the forced changes sold as sustainable development—is posited as the solution. 2 Sustainable development discourse justifies the enclosure of large tracts of rainforest by governments, large environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and Ã Data used in this analysis was collected as part of a post-doctoral research grant awarded by the Social Sciences multilateral agencies under the rubric of \" new institutions of commons management. \" 3 This enclosure of the commons has had tragic social, economic and ecological consequences .

However, declaring a natural resource to be protected has an immense influence on the livelihoods of many local communities living in and around the protected area. This article explores the role of protected sal forests—namely, the Madhupur National Park (MNP) on the livelihoods of forest-dependent ethnic minorities , drawing empirical data from ethnic households. The results revealed that the MNP has brought changes, most of which have had negative impacts on ethnic livelihoods. Now their livelihoods are not stable, as most do not have substantial sources of securing income. In spite of this, the ethnic communities have experienced severe antagonistic relationships with park managers and faced social inequity; all these factors affect their livelihoods. Therefore, establishment of a legitimate process to constructively work with the local communities is the most feasible and just way to achieve conservation and development.","doi":"10.1080/10549811.2013.762571","journal":{"name":"Journal of Sustainable Forestry","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":328}

These forest reforms aim to eliminate the main causes of forest depletion as well as alleviate poverty through the participation of local people, who depend on the forests for their livelihoods. This study explores the impact of PF initiatives on the livelihoods of the local ethnic and non-ethnic populations, drawing empirical data from the partici-patory forestry programs (PFPs). The findings indicate that the most common feature of PFPs were the contribution of financial capital to the participants, whereas other livelihood capitals faced constraints and difficulties. In addition, inequity issues and social capital differences were created between the ethnic and non-ethnic participants , and a lack of commitment by the local Forest Department resulted in PFPs having limited success in creating sustainable livelihoods for the participants. The overall situation revealed that PFPs alone were not sufficient to conserve and develop the Sal forests or assure people's basic needs. Therefore, a long-term-integrated approach by the Forest Department is necessary to address the diversified needs of low-income forest-dependent people in a more sustainable way.","doi":"10.2989/20702620.2012.701434","journal":{"name":"Southern Forests","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":330}

Several studies have shown that local-community support for National Parks is based mainly on perceptions of benefits and costs against the background of social, cultural, political and economic considerations. This paper examines the experience in the Cross River National Park (CRNP) in southeast Nigeria using data collected through rapid rural appraisal techniques, household questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions and guided interviews. The results show that in spite of a high level of community awareness of the need to conserve the forests of the study area, there is a low level of local support for the CRNP forest conservation initiative. Four main factors are identified as the main influences on the support extended to the project, namely: reality and expectations of socio-economic development, the pace of project implementation, the relationship between park staff and communities, and the historical rights of local people to the forest of the study area. The implications of the findings relate to the long-term sustainability of the CRNP as a protected forest area.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":331}

This study examined the influence of NGOs on local people's perceptions of CF management by using a quantitative analysis based on a questionnaire survey. Three different forest user groups (FUGs) supported by the Nepal Swiss Community Forestry Project were selected from the Dolakha and Ramecchap districts: an FUG supported by another FUG acting as an NGO, an FUG supported by an NGO specializing in CF, and an FUG without NGO support. A structured survey examined the perception of CF management based on satisfaction, involvement, and self-reliance in 244 selected households belonging to the three FUGs. Knowledge of CF and personal information was also surveyed and analyzed. The results showed that NGO involvement influences factors such as self-reliance and knowledge of CF. FUG members who were supported by an NGO or an FUG had a significantly higher perception with respect to self-reliance and knowledge than did members without such support. This indicates that experienced FUGs can serve as adequate service providers for the CF formation procedure, in a manner similar to that of NGOs. On the other hand, the limited support from NGOs or FUGs during the formation process seemed insufficient to fulfill the expectations of aid agencies with respect to the enhancement of satisfaction and active participation on the part of FUG members. If aid agencies expect NGOs and FUGs to enhance the satisfaction and participation of members , these intermediary organizations should be assigned to support more CF activities than just the formation procedure. Aid agencies should take responsibility for strengthening the capabilities of NGOs and FUGs, as needed.","doi":"10.1007/s10310-005-0172-9","journal":{"name":"J For Res","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":333}

M.","dAbstract":"Incentives used to encourage local residents to support conservation range from integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs), which indirectly connect improved livelihoods with biodiversity protection, to direct payments for ecosystem services (PES). A unique hybrid between these two strategies, the Arabuko-Sokoke Schools and Ecotourism Scheme (ASSETS), provides secondary-school bursaries to encourage stewardship of a biodiverse highly-imperiled Kenyan forest. Household surveys and semi-structured interviews were used to assess the effectiveness of ASSETS by comparing attitudes and perceptions toward the forest among scheme beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. The most commonly identified benefit of the forest was resource extraction (for example fuelwood), followed by ecosystem services (such as source of rain). Those in favour of forest clearing tended not to be ASSETS beneficiaries, were less-educated, and were less likely to mention ecosystem services and tourism as forest benefits. ASSETS appears to shape pro-conservation attitudes among beneficiaries and foster a sense of responsibility toward the forest. Challenges for ASSETS are similar to those faced by many conservation and development projects, namely unsteady funding and the risk that the extremely poor may be overlooked. ASSETS may serve as an effective hybrid between the PES and ICDP approaches, and such educational support provides a promising conservation incentive.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892912000161","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":335}

In an environment suffering from severe woody biomass shortages water scarcity, erosion and land degradation, fast growing and resilient eucalyptus species perform better than most indigenous woodland and forest tree species (as well as most crops). In addition to increasing biomass and providing ground cover, the sale of eucalyptus poles and products has substantial potential to raise farm incomes, reduce poverty, increase food security and diversify smallholder-farming systems in less-favored areas of northern Ethiopia. Despite the potential for eucalyptus to improve rural livelihoods in northern Ethiopia in 1997, the regional government of Tigray imposed a ban on eucalyptus tree planting on farmlands. This ban is related to concerns regarding potential negative environmental externalities associated with eucalyptus and also due to the desire to reserve productive farmland for crop production. The regional government promotes planting of eucalyptus and other species in community woodlots, and has recently begun to allow private planting of eucalyptus on community wasteland and steep hillsides. In this paper, we review the debate about the ecological impacts of eucalyptus trees, as well as the economic factors that influence whether smallholders invest in these trees. Ex ante benefit-cost analysis based on community level survey data from Tigray illustrates that under most conditions planting eucalyptus trees yields high rates of return, well above 20% under most circumstances. The effect of variable harvest rates, the costs of decreased crop production when eucalyptus trees are planted on farmlands, and differences between administrative zones are considered relative to our base case in our rate of return estimates. The importance of fast growing tree species that can accommodate the high discount rates associated with smallholders in this region is emphasized.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":337}

The demand for an assessment of the current forest management, which generally involves criteria and indicators (C&I) at all levels, from local to national has increased in the last decade. Therefore a case study has been done, applying a combination of a top-down and bottom-up approach with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to identify a set of C&I with different groups of stakeholders in selected sites at the forestry management unit level (leshoz). Six workshops and a series of discussion meetings were conducted to perform a sound analysis of the preferences of four different stakeholder groups. A final set of C&I that consists of seven criteria and 45 indicators has been identified for evaluating sustainable forest management (SFM) in the walnut-fruit forests. Forest health and vitality was found to be the most important criterion, while the maintenance of forest biodiversity was found to be the least prioritized among other criteria. Furthermore, four different management strategies were developed by foresters, research groups, ecologists and forest administrators in order to overcome the present challenges in forest management. By utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), one particular management strategy (MS II) was identified by all stakeholder groups as being the overall best alternative strategy. It was shown that the consideration of non-timber forest products and other options for income generation can improve the livelihood of the people, increase the productivity of resources as well as conserving the gene pool for maintaining forest biodiversity. The findings of this study highlight the importance of a C&I evaluation and its further policy implications. Moreover, it is discussed how the involvement of local stakeholders in the decision making process and their participation in forest management could be stimulated by the C&I development process in the walnut forests of Kyrgyzstan.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2012.01.010","journal":null,"aid":338}

Increasingly, research initiatives are undertaken to enhance understanding of the perceptions and attitudes of rural stakeholders. The effectiveness of the expanding protected-area system in China is critically constrained by similar considerations of community mentality. This paper provides an empirical assessment of local responses towards conservation efforts based on a case study of the recently established Shimentai Nature Reserve (SNR) situated in Yingde, Guangdong Province, China. Questionnaire surveys, face-to-face interviews, and group discussions were employed to gauge local residents' knowledge, perceptions, and expectations towards the SNR. The study covered seven villages situated in and around the reserve, grouped into far-zone (floodplain) and near-zone (upland) categories , accommodating Hakka (Han) and minority Yao peoples. Many respondents had inadequate knowledge, understanding , and perceptions of the reserve. Although most respondents welcomed the expected park-related dividends, the most affected near-zone villagers anticipated losses due to restriction on traditional resource-extraction activities in the forest. The local expectations were influenced by place of residence , emigration of rural young, and household affluence. The lack of local participation in management and inadequate dissemination of information posed obstacles to effective conservation. The high expectation of accruing benefits from development projects, including tourism, might be misplaced and might not be realized. The present honeymoon period of positive attitudes could end soon if the hopes remain unfulfilled for too long. The need to win sustained local support and provide alternative means of livelihood is emphasized.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-002-2623-9","journal":null,"aid":340}

During the past two decades, however, this decline has reversed in various island countries. Today CBMRM continues to grow, refuting the claim that traditional non-Western attitudes toward nature cannot provide a sound foundation for contemporary natural resource management. Limited entry, marine protected areas, closed areas, closed seasons, and restrictions on damaging or overly efficient fishing methods are some of the methods being used. Factors contributing to the upsurge include a growing perception of scarcity, the restrengthening of traditional village-based authority, and marine tenure by means of legal recognition and government support, better conservation education, and increasingly effective assistance, and advice from regional and national governments and NGOs. Today's CBMRM is thus a form of cooperative management, but one in which the community still makes and acts upon most of the management decisions.","doi":"10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150524","journal":{"name":"Annu.

World development, 30 (9). pp. 1591-1605. ABSTRACT Recent debates about governance, poverty and environmental sustainability have emphasized a 'rights-based' approach to development, in which individual rights and freedoms are strongly associated with fair and equitable development. Such approaches are defended both in terms of the 'intrinsic' benefits of basic human rights and the 'instrumental' benefits these may provide. However, the process of implementing a rights-based approach entails a number of political costs. Principal among these are the costs of ensuring that social rights are effectively enforced and the related cost of encouraging the state to intervene on behalf of poor and vulnerable groups in society. Reflecting upon these themes, this paper explores the case of Thailand's 'Community Forestry Bill', legislation that was introduced to support rights of access and environmental conservation for communities living in forest reserve areas. Examining watershed forests in the north and mangrove conservation in the south, it argues that efforts to support rural livelihoods through the establishment of community rights have been undermined by powerful private actors and by a state that has generally ruled in favour of commercial interests. The article then documents the creative ways in which civil society organizations have been able to negotiate and secure informal rights of access in rural areas. Such findings, it concludes, illustrate the need to situate rights-based approaches within the wider public spheres in which rules, rights, and 'community' are established, and defended.","doi":"10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00057-8","journal":null,"aid":343}

L. and Jones J. L.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Conservation and protected area management in South Africa has moved away from a strictly preservationist paradigm of managing for biodiversity . It is increasingly expected to contribute to poverty alleviation in underdeveloped regions by acting as a stimulus for sustainable development through continued and/or expanded resourcedependent livelihoods and the creation of new opportunities stemming from protected areas. Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCA), mega Peace Parks that cross international borders, are one of the latest conservation and development paradigms in Southern Africa. TFCAs have gained broad support, yet empirical research findings of impacts on communities are lacking. I used a Community-integrated Geographic Information System, comprised of traditional survey techniques, interviews, observation, and aerial photograph interpretation, to explore resource access, attitudes , and consumption in a South African community bordering part of the Lubombo TFCA between South Africa, Swaziland, and Mozambique. I begin by exploring the influence of a globalization of conservation values based on Northern epistemological ideologies of nature. Local communities and their livelihoods are often viewed by conservation agencies as homogenous and in direct contrast to biodiversity protection. This is especially evident in the context of a polarized society such as South Africa, which illustrates the challenge of understanding and incorporating socially differentiated paradigms for conservation areas and local users (Weiner and Harris 1999 ). I explore transboundary conservation as a movement, and particularly The Peace Parks Foundation as an institutional driver in Southern Africa. The potential of Peace Parks to provide local benefits is examined in the community of Mbangweni, South Africa. Empirical evidence suggests that the Lubombo TFCA may not provide significant sustainable development, but may actually decrease local access to social, economic , and natural resources.","doi":"10.1080/13504500509469637","journal":{"name":"International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Ecology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":345}

This article examines three diverse community forests surrounding the national park and explores how national policy has been mediated by emerging community forestry institutions to create diVerent levels of resource access and beneWt distribution both within and between local user groups. Mindful of recent critiques of community-based conservation, the analysis gives considerable attention to the dynamics of power relations and inequality. The extent to which property rights have been transferred to the local level is evaluated and to whom power has been devolved in the process is assessed. The distribution of beneWts arising from community forestry is critically examined. It seems that the current system for community forestry creates suYcient incentives for local cooperation due to the potential for increased access to important resources and a high perception of ownership of community forests among the communities. However, emerging institutions vary in the extent to which they reproduce favourable resource access conditions for elites and beneWt distribution does seem to be skewed in favour of the wealthy and higher castes, even where management practices on the surface appear fair. National policy creates suYcient but not necessary conditions for achieving downward accountability, transparency and fairness. Greater attention to these issues is needed for buVer zone community forestry to better serve the poor and marginalised populations within user groups.","doi":"10.1016/j.geoforum.2006.10.010","journal":{"name":"Geoforum","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":346}

Informants , stakeholder interviews and questionnaires from local fishermen were used to gain knowledge of fishing factors, perceptions and threat to the small-scale fishing community in a coastal region in the province of Phang-nga, Thailand. Results revealed communities utilising multi-geared, multi-species fisheries with a preference for marketable species that sell on a local scale. Whilst subsistence and local markets share equally the use of catches, there is a noticeable decline in small-scale fishers being recruited into the industry. This was considered by some to be due to urbanisation and by others to opportunities in tourism but was viewed as a socioeconomic shift by government informants towards medium sized operations formed by resilient groups. Current management can be classified as open access, with virtually no management or regulations in place. This has led to fishers listing failing stocks and commercial fleets as the biggest threats to their livelihoods. Management initiatives are needed to focus on protecting and improving coastal stocks by clamping down on illegal activity large-scale from fishers and reviewing fishers access for resource protection.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":344}

Perceptions of problems, and the capacity for any of these elements of society to participate in the management process, are critical factors which will influence which management issues are identified, the scale and the scope of a management plan and its implementation. This paper presents a case study of an NGO-driven effort to build capacity and begin implementing effective collaborative coastal management in the Saman~ bay region of the Dominican Republic. A participatory and consensus-building planning process was used to identify priority problems and strategies for solving them. Strategies were discussed jointly by local community and user groups, then combined into a preliminary regional management plan. To help the process endure and become more integrated an iterative and cyclical management approach will need to be adopted.

Despite the knowledge of the multiple dimensions of this relationship and its importance, species and ecosystems are still disappearing at an alarming rate. Anthropogenic pressures are the prime reason for this trend, yet attempts to reduce such pressures and conserve species in protected areas have only achieved limited success. This has led to the realization that sustainable consumptive use approaches that can combine production and conservation functions are also important in conserving biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Agroforestry, as part of a multifunctional working landscape, can play a major role in conserving and even enhancing biodiversity from farms to the landscape level in both tropical and temperate regions of the world. This special issue is an attempt to bring together a collection of articles that not only explore and demonstrate the biodiversity benefits of agroforestry, but also the mechanisms by which agroforestry systems sustain such high floristic and faunal diversity. While it is important to conserve biodiversity in protected areas, the articles in the special issue reiterate the importance of agroforestry as a critical tool in conserving biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.","doi":"10.1007/s10457-012-9517-5","journal":null,"aid":937}

The study uses partici-patory methods and aims to contribute to (i) the development of low-income wetland communities, (ii) to prepare these communities to become less dependent on wetlands without receding into poverty, and (iii) the better management of the wetlands. The communities in direct dependence and intimate interaction with Nakivubo wetlands are mainly poor, live and work under hazardous conditions, and their activities pose a threat to the ecological function of the wetlands. Yet these wetlands are important for filtering the city's waste and storm water before it flows into Lake Victoria's Murchison Bay, which is Kampala's source of piped water. Government approaches to the problem of wetland encroachment have largely failed because they are confrontational, and are not consistent or participatory. The study has in the first year conducted a series of activities including stakeholder analysis, resource analysis, livelihood analysis, a questionnaire survey and action planning. Preliminary data show that wetland dependency is very high among the poor nearby communities. They practice cultivation, brick-making and harvesting of wetland vegetation. However, these activities are under threat because wetland resources are dwindling due to increasing population and over-use. Livelihoods are threatened not only by the decreasing productivity of the wetland, but also by the ever-present government threat to evict wetland encroachers to restore its ecology. The study therefore works with communities to prepare for less dependence on wetlands so that they do not suddenly recede into worse poverty if they are evicted. They formulate strategies to enhance alternative livelihood , and for management of the wetland. Action plans have been formulated to address the situation through a newly created association.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":353}

B. and Aidoo R. and Nkem J. and Ajayie O. C. and Kanninen M. and Luukkanen O. and Idinoba M.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction Taungya is a forestry system that involves inter-planting trees with agricultural crops, particularly the local population's staple foods, and so serves to satisfy the farmer's quest for arable land (FAO, 1984). Taungya starts as an agroforestry system during the initial three years, and then evolves to a plantation system when the trees form a closed canopy, and farmers are expected to tend the trees to maturity. Farmers are also expected after three years to move to other plots, mostly in degraded state-owned/managed forest reserves, to repeat the agroforestry practice. Interactions between crops and trees under taungya systems are designed to achieve complementary rather than competitive effects (Vieira et al., 2009). The outcome of such interactions is influenced by factors related to species combinations and planting densities, the level of competition for growth resources, climatic and edaphic factors and management regimes (Imo, 2009). Originally from Myanmar, the taungya system was introduced by colonial authorities in some African countries as a means to replenish the decreasing forest stock to meet future market demands for wood, alongside the rehabilitation and restoration of degraded forest areas. It was introduced, for example, in Ghana in 1930, in Nigeria in 1920 (von Hellermann, 2007) and in Kenya in 1910 (Witcomb and Dorward, 2009). In Ghana, just as in Kenya and Nigeria, little success was achieved under the traditional taungya system as the government was unable to effectively manage huge plantations throughout the country. In addition, Ghanaian farmers had no tree ownership, no financial benefits accruing from the planted trees (Milton, 1994) and no decision-making role in any aspect of forest management (Birikorang, 2001). Other problems noted by Agyeman et al. (2003) included a lack of supervision and abuse of power by forest and public officials, especially in farm allocation. As a result of these challenges, the system was suspended in 1984. Similarly, in Kenya and Nigeria, the taungya system was banned due to poor management that had led to increased destruction of indigenous forest (von Hellermann, 2007; Witcomb and Dorward, 2009). The Ghanaian government, within its 1994 Wildlife and Forest Policy (WFP) and forest plantations development programme, reviewed and reintroduced the traditional taungya system in 2002 as the modified taungya system (MTS). The MTS aimed at meeting future demands for industrial timber, improving environmental quality through the restoration of degraded forest lands, and increasing national food security through increased food production (FC, 2006). In some cases, additional livelihood activities such as small-scale trading, poultry or mushroom farming, bee or livestock keeping were built into the design of MTS. The coordination of MTS by the government of Ghana, through the Forestry Commission, now took into account the financial benefits for all stakeholders involved and transferred ownership of the trees from a single owner (the government) to multiple owners (farmers, local communities, government and land owners) (Kalame, 2009). Within three years (2002–2005), an estimated area of 60 000 ha of trees was planted under MTS (FC, 2006). The trees include both indigenous and exotic species such as Tectona grandis (Teak), Cedrela odorata (Cedrela), Eucalyptus species, Cassia siamea (Cassia), Triplochiton scleroxylon (Wawa), Terminalia superba (Ofram), Terminalia ivorensis (Emira), Mansonia altissima (Mansonia), Tarrietia utilis (Nyankom), Khaya ivorensis and Khaya anthotheca (Mahogany) and Entandrophragma angolense (Edinam). The implementation of MTS also enhanced food production (FC, 2006). From 2003 to 2005, for example, the plantain harvest was about six-fold (634%) greater than the expected output. Common crops cultivated by farmers include pepper, okra, plantain, maize, cocoyam, yams, cassava, tomatoes, cabbage and groundnut. As in other parts of Ghana, the transitional zone where MTS is mostly carried out is highly degraded and vulnerable to climatic and non-climatic factors. It is experiencing a shift from forest to wooded land/savannah vegetation as the desert gradually creeps southwards. The vulnerable situation of Ghana is of increasing concern to decision makers and development agencies in finding the most practical and effective ways to address climate change issues. A multistakeholder platform, the national climate change committee (NCC) of the government of Ghana, is in the process of developing comprehensive national strategies on climate change mitigation and adaptation for forestry, agriculture and energy as part of a national climate change policy development. Some approaches exist, however, and provide guidelines and indicative activities to reduce the potential vulnerability of societies and ecosystems to the impacts of climate change. These include the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) under the climate change convention (UNFCCC) (UNFCCC, 2009 ), the ecosystem approach (EA) to climate change adaptation and mitigation (World Bank, 2009; UNCBD, 2010) and the Adaptation Policy Framework (APF) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (Lim et al., 2005). Many governments acknowledge the existence of legislation and programmes that are useful to climate change adaptation and mitigation, even though not originally developed in response to the climate convention (Tompkins and Amundsen, 2008). We argue that it is necessary to integrate, where possible, all these existing practices into national climate change policy or programmes taking into account the different features, activities or characteristics outlined, for example, in the APF. Through different programmes and projects, the government of Ghana began responding to and addressing the drivers of vulnerability even before the creation of the climate convention, following drought and bushfire events in West Africa in the 1980s. It is absolutely necessary and far more feasible for the climate change community to integrate and adopt, with the necessary adjustment, those practices that increase adaptation and reduce vulnerability. The MTS of Ghana offers an opportunity to examine its potential as an example of best/supportive government practices for climate change adaptation. The objectives of this study were therefore to: (i) highlight, by drawing from the APF, indicative elements and features of an adaptation strategy important in reducing the vulnerability of society and the environment, and (ii) assess the level of compatibility of the strategy with existing policy programmes in relation to MTS in the transition zone of Ghana. Section 2 of this paper describes the APF. The approach and methods used are outlined in Section 3. The vulnerability context of the study area is analysed in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 analyse the policy and socio-economic context of MTS, while Section 7 concludes and provides recommendations to improve and support MTS as an adaptation strategy.","doi":"10.1016/j.envsci.2011.03.011","journal":null,"aid":355}

This paper explores the dynamics of social-ecological systems in the estuary of the Patos Lagoon in southern Brazil. The paper identifies key factors that increase and/or minimize the vulnerabilities of the fishing communities in this lagoon with the objective of understanding: (a) the degree to which fishing communities are able to build adaptive and learning capacities to minimize/reduce vulnerabilities and maintain their livelihoods; and (b) how and under what circumstances external and internal factors may influence and disrupt the social-ecological resilience in this lagoon system. Results show that fishing communities with a higher degree of self-organization are able to create ways to minimize their vulnerability to adverse climatic conditions. However, only a few communities have developed adaptive mechanisms to cope with the influence of climate on resource abundance and availability. Little external institutional support for small-scale fishing communities, erosion of their traditional resource use systems and decreasing fish stocks in recent decades have all led to a gradual increase in the vulnerability of fishing livelihoods in this lagoon. The uncertainties associated with climate are related to increasing vulnerability and influence the degree of resource conservation and exploitation. The lack of public policies to deal with the impact of climate variability on the livelihoods of fishing communities and the presence of weak institutions in resource governance represent major threats to the social security of fishers in this region.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":356}

Little is known about why preferences vary greatly and how this affects support for management actions. This paper explores preferences for a range of wildlife species among a sample of the rural population adjacent to Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. We also examine the degree of acceptance for alternative management interventions when potentially dangerous animals pose different levels of problems to human beings, and the extent to which these attitudes are related to species preferences. Gender has a significant effect on species preferences. Men like most species better than women. Age has no significant effect, but level of education affects preference level for some species. Species preferences have a positive effect on support for management intervention when dangerous animals cause small or moderate problems to humans, i.e. there is a higher degree of acceptance of problems caused by animals that are well liked. In situations where human life is threatened, species preferences have no effect on preferred management actions. Appreciation of animals is a combination of functional, consumptive and cultural dimensions, and there is no simple link between species preferences and attitudes toward management actions. The local context and concrete experience with wildlife encounters is more important for shaping normative beliefs like attitudes towards management actions than global wildlife attitudes.","doi":"10.1007/s10531-005-6196-9","journal":null,"aid":358}

P. and Nyahongo J. W. and Kideghesho J. R.","dAbstract":"Serengeti National Park is a world class icon for wildlife tourism attracting a diverse group of tourists from all over the world. The park has played a pivotal role in protecting large populations of wildlife species of the Eastern African savannah and the globally outstanding biological phenomena such as the annual migration of wildebeest. However, the history of the park is also characterised by resource use conflicts and pressures that could threaten the current quality of the visitor environment. In this paper we examine the attitudes of international visitors toward the management and attributes of the park. Overall, the tourists report a high degree of satisfaction with most aspects of their trip. Yet, the current tourists are concerned about possible future changes that could alter the visitor environment and idealized images of the African wild lands. Basic environmental attitudes (degrees of ecocentrism) have effects on attitudes toward management of the park. Tourists expressing a high degree of ecocentrism are more likely to support management actions aimed at controlling tourism activities, access and impacts. They also express a stronger interest in experiencing nature, wilderness and local culture. The results are discussed in light of the major impact factors and conservation issues facing the management of Serengeti National Park; poaching, poverty in surrounding communities, increasing population pressure, habitat degradation, and wildlife diseases.","doi":"10.1016/j.jnc.2008.02.001","journal":{"name":"Tanzania.

People are extremely poor, with 97% having incomes of less than 1 USD/day. Forest income constitutes around 15% of total income; only non-farm income (47%) and agriculture (28%) rank higher. The poorest segment depends more on forest income than the least poor group, but the medium income group exhibits the highest dependence. Fuelwood constitutes the major source of such income followed by fodder. The incomes mainly support current consumption. People with better access to the forest reserve have higher total income, forest income, and relative forest income. As revealed through a Gini-coefficient analysis, forest resources have an important income equalizing effect across rural households. A particular group of resource poor farmers (8.1% of sample), with little access to agricultural land and a high representation of female heads, derives an average of 65% of their income from the forest. An important policy lesson is that restricting people's access to forest resources can have substantial effects on household livelihoods and welfare, and would serve to increase income inequalities in the area. Livelihood researchers should now recognize the substantial income from forest resources.","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.08.018","journal":null,"aid":360}

Community based natural resource management and the neglect of local institutions in policy development","authors":"Kamoto J. and Clarkson G. and Dorward P. and Shepherd D.","dAbstract":"Approaches to natural resource management emphasise the importance of involving local people and institutions in order to build capacity, limit costs, and achieve environmental sustainability. Governments worldwide, often encouraged by international donors, have formulated devolution policies and legal instruments that provide an enabling environment for devolved natural resource management. However, implementation of these policies reveals serious challenges. This article explores the effects of limited involvement of local people and institutions in policy development and implementation. An in-depth study of the Forest Policy of Malawi and Village Forest Areas in the Lilongwe district provides an example of externally driven policy development which seeks to promote local management of natural resources. The article argues that policy which has weak ownership by national government and does not adequately consider the complexity of local institutions, together with the effects of previous initiatives on them, can create a cumulative legacy through which destructive resource use practices and social conflict may be reinforced. In short, poorly developed and implemented community based natural resource management policies can do considerably more harm than good. Approaches are needed that enable the policy development process to embed an in-depth understanding of local institutions whilst incorporating flexibility to account for their location-specific nature. This demands further research on policy design to enable rigorous identification of positive and negative institutions and ex-ante exploration of the likely effects of different policy interventions.","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2013.06.002","journal":{"name":"Land Use Policy","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":362}

However, lack of active involvement in planning and limited access to conservation areas makes the economic prospects of initiatives like the Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) rather questionable. This study was undertaken in the Mbarang'andu WMA in Namtumbo District , Tanzania to assess the contribution of community-based conservation approaches such as WMAs in enhancing conservation of wildlife resources and poverty alleviation around protected areas. The study methods used included participatory rural appraisal, key informant interviews, direct field observations and household survey. A sample of 10% of the village households was selected for interview. LandSat images from 1995 were used in mapping the physical resource base and land use/cover types of the district. Household data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Findings from the study indicate that much of the village land has been allocated for biodiversity conservation in form of forests and/or WMAs. However, there is little evidence to show the results of such interventions in terms of poverty alleviation, which constrains other local livelihoods while benefiting distant resource users such as private investors. The article argues that to enhance local involvement in conservation of biodiversity while addressing poverty issues, mechanisms for accessing wildlife and forest resources would need to be reconsidered. In particular, this study establishes that the hunting quotas to the villages surrounding the WMA need to be increased to enhance community access to animal protein.","doi":"10.1016/j.agee.2012.08.008","journal":{"name":"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":363}

Field methods involved quantitative and qualitative data collection of forest-adjacent households of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. Results show that the contribution of different types of NTFPs to household economy varies in terms of subsistence and cash income. However, overall NTFP income is much higher than income from timber or firewood which indicates a larger dependence of the households on NTFPs. Income data analysis also finds that the poor households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs for their subsistence and cash income than the better-off households. Moreover, the study reveals that there are many other socioeconomic factors at the household level such as number of members in household and total value of household implements and furniture that are significantly correlated with the NTFP income. More site-specific applied research on NTFP income and influential factors is necessary to generalize the findings for other parts of the world with similar socioeconomic and environmental settings.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2011.08.003","journal":null,"aid":941}

Among 162 million population, 60 million (37%) live below poverty line; and the poverty rate is even higher (46%) in the hilly forest region such as in CHT (Hunzai et al. 2011, BBS 2009). The high density of poor people, their heavy dependence on natural resources, widespread corruption, undefined property rights and lack of forest management and development planning has led to the overexploitation of forest resources, resulting in an accelerated rate of resource depletion (Biswas and Choudhury 2007, GOB 2009).

Based on a survey of 777 households around five PAs in India and Nepal, this paper provides a comparative perspective of Indian and Nepali households' views of protected area benefits and costs, their attitude toward conservation in general, and attitude toward protected area staff. Results indicate mixed responses towards tourism, varying from very favorable in Nepal to less favorable in India. The majority (81%) held positive attitudes towards the existence and importance of PAs but had negative perceptions of PA staff (69%). Most residents perceived benefits from access to fuel wood, fodder and other PA resources including benefits from tourism, while crop and livestock losses from wildlife were the main costs. Households overall positive attitudes towards the PAs and conservation despite high losses from living around PAs suggests that local residents may support conservation if their livelihood needs are met. Comparisons of household attitudes and perceptions suggest that locally based strategies rather than top-down approaches are likely to be more effective. Extending PA benefits to smaller landholders, households that are highly resource-dependent or experiencing higher income losses from human-wildlife conflicts, and less educated residents are particularly important to balance costs and losses from living around protected areas.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":366}

The Ranomafana forest area provides a variety of benefits that contribute considerably to local inhabitants' livelihoods and well-being. Changes in ecosystem service flows alter the provision of many important ecosystem services at the local level, which is likely to affect local livelihoods negatively and increase local vulnerability and inequality. The findings indicate the presence of trade-offs between types of ecosystem services and between different societal goals, namely conservation and development. Benefit trade-offs also occur within and between beneficiary groups and across spatial and temporal scales. Although conservation might prove beneficial for local people in the long run, its immediate local costs are high. The findings reveal the importance of integrating local perceptions of ecosystem services into conservation planning. In addition, there is a need for further negotiations of the trade-offs between ecosystem services, conservation and development in Ranomafana.","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.12.003","journal":null,"aid":368}

However, conserving land in this way can become a development issue that restricts agricultural expansion and resource exploitation, with potentially substantial costs to people living in conditions of high social impoverishment and high critical natural capital. This paper investigates whether Nepal's Bardia National Park and conservation incentives have contributed to the sustainable livelihoods of households. Data on household livelihoods and conservation benefits were collected through a questionnaire survey of 358 households and community workshops in three villages. Different impacts on household livelihoods were observed between the villages. It was found that these impacts were dependent on household characteristics, access to prior capital, and the social position of the household within society. Households lacking resources, being poor and belonging to lower castes were least included and also benefited less from development projects. As finance in the form of development projects from organisations continues to flow to the communities, it is important that detailed livelihood planning focussing on alternative regenerative livelihoods and micro-enterprises in the informal sector is included to target those households that are highly dependent on park resources. Livelihood planning must also include a clear linkage between livelihood enhancing activities and the conservation programme so that communities are aware that the benefits they receive are due to the protected area. Appreciation of benefits and their positive impact on livelihoods is important for the sustainability of incentive-based programmes.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.054","journal":null,"aid":370}

A. and Badoni and Bhattarai N.","dAbstract":"The literature defines livelihoods as the processes comprising the capabilities, assets and activities that provide a means for living to the human beings. Livelihoods are best examined through Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF), which is based on the premise that livelihood is not about resource productivity but it is about people and their lives. Livelihoods are sustainable when they are: a) resilient to shocks and stresses, b) independent of external support, c) maintain the productivity (and diversity) of natural stocks; and d) do not adversely affect the livelihoods of others. In other words, SLF: a) builds on the strengths of people, their resources and knowledge systems, b) strengthens local institutional capacity, c) attempts to remove conditions causing poverty rather than poverty itself, and d) gives priority to improving policies, processes and institutions in developing and implementing programs. Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP)-based livelihood systems are often mediated by the market forces and/or related directly to employment and income of the poor people. Based on the research work carried out by IDRC supported research in South Asia, we find that MAP and other biodiversity-based livelihoods can not only become poverty reducing they can also be made socially equitable and gender balanced. However, the interventions have to be carefully designed to enhance and diversify livelihood strategies with a focus on strengthening existing biodiversity-based livelihoods by considering the following points: a) both non-monetary and monetary benefits from biodiversity-based livelihoods; b) improving linkages and synergies with and amongst other components of biodiversity; c) landscape-scale management practices that protect or enhance biodiversity (organic farming, mixed farming, community forest management, water management to enhance aquatic resources, opposition to enclosure of the commons, etc.). MAP-based livelihoods can be easily mainstreamed with other components to enhance human welfare, especially among the poor and marginalized communities.

Although studies predict that fish stocks are on the decline there is little evidence that these declines are being countered by changes in either fishing regulations or fishing practices. Fishermen rarely comply with regulations, instead operationalizing and directing the fishery on their own. In these circumstances understanding how fishermen perceive and use resources has significant management and policy implications. Our study examined fishermen's perceptions about the state of fish stocks and documents current fishing practice and management strategies in India. We surveyed 342 fishermen in two states, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. We found that 86% of fishermen perceived a decline in catch and 69% perceived a decline in bycatch. Fishermen adapt to these declines by increasing fishing area and time spent, changing their gear, and overlapping in fishing zones. The convoluted interactions between ineffective community and state regulations guiding their actions has prevented fishermen from developing successful models of sustainable fisheries management. We identified non-compliance with regulations and government incentives as an important livelihood opportunity. Non-compliance drives change in fishing practice by giving fishermen the flexibility to respond to perceived fish catch dynamics by modifying their practices. We recommend strengthening local fishing communities by enabling them to enforce fishing regulations locally and by scaling back of existing government incentives, to protect the sustainability of these fisheries.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605312001251","journal":null,"aid":371}

The scenario analysis showed that increased monitoring and punishment (including societal pressure) could enhance compliance, especially among younger fishermen, who claimed not to depend solely on fisheries.

This paper presents lessons from an assessment of an autonomous adaptation in the Great Ruaha River catchment in Tanzania following WWF intervention. The project was designed to address challenges resulting from natural resource use and existing levels of climate variability by changing water resource management. The study applied participatory methods and an open-ended questionnaire to collect data. The study found key adaptation benefits, including reduced vulnerability to drought and strengthened local water user associations and other regional institutions. As a result of the project interventions from 2003 to 2009, rural livelihoods became more profitable and water-sustainable, and local livelihood strategies were diversified. Regional ecosystems improved as a result of restoring river flows in some rivers, conservation of riparian vegetation and halting tree felling for charcoal production. As a result of these changes the communities and ecosystems in the Great Ruaha River catchment should be more resilient to emerging climate change impacts, yet the need for further physical interventions and institutional reform is identified. The study concludes that strengthening local institutions and capacity building are fundamental to climate change adaptation and sustainable freshwater management.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":373}

To this end, the article presents findings from the empirical analysis of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in India. Two key recommendations emerge from this analysis. One, the proposals for operationalizing rights-based approaches will likely be far more effective if they protect the inalienability of a minimal set of rights critical to the subsistence and well-being of forest people, as opposed to promising the protection of an expansive set of rights subject to the instrumentality of conservation.

N. and Schmidt-Vogt D.","dAbstract":"Introduction Protected areas (PAs) around the world are considered effective means for conserving biodiversity. However, the effectiveness of PAs can be impaired by policies that are not consistent with the interests of local communities (Wallner et al 2007). Since almost all drivers affecting biodiversity conservation are of socioeconomic origin (Sodhi et al 2004), PA management should address such issues, including those related to access to forest resources. Limited access to forest resources, on the other hand, has a negative bearing on rural people's livelihoods, which ultimately affects their perceptions of PAs and conservation policy (Brown 1998; Mü ller-Bö ker and Kollmair 2000). Farmers, who make up 69% of Bhutan's population, depend directly on natural resources, including forests (RGOB 2002). The emphasis of conservation policy according to the constitution of Bhutan, however, is on maintaining a minimum of 60% of the total land area under forest cover (RGOB 2002) as habitat for wildlife, especially mammals, and on curbing the growing pressure on forests, which is arising from the country's expanding human population (RGOB 2004). Improving the welfare and livelihood of people is another important aspect of the constitution of Bhutan, for which the change of Bhutan to a democratic form of government in 2008 provides further scope. Conservation policies still reflect the ''fortress conservation'' model according to Galvin and Haller (2008), which was applied when conservation in Bhutan started in the 1960s (RGOB 2008). Conservation in Bhutan has been termed a success mainly because of the rapid increase in the total land area under PA management that occurred between 1999 (35%) and 2008 (51%). Parks, however, were established based on biological considerations only, with little or no regard for the needs of local communities (Seeland 2000). Though Bhutan's park policies allow residents to remain inside PAs (Wang et al 2006a), they restrict their access to forests at the same time and expose them to dangers emanating from forests (Wang et al 2006aWang et al , 2006b). The impact on local populations of giving such a large extent of forestland PA status and its effect on their perceptions of conservation have not yet been studied in Bhutan. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining forest resources use by local residents in Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park (JSWNP) and how their perceptions are shaped by their dependence on the forest and by park management interventions. JSWNP was selected for this research, as it is a flagship area for conservation owing to its location, geographical variations, and heterogeneous communities (RGOB 2004; Wang et al 2006a). JSWNP was demarcated in 1993 and gazetted in 1995 in a top-down process that left local people out of the designation procedure. Past research in JSWNP primarily addressed human-wildlife conflicts and the attitudes of the local people concerning this problem (Wang and Macdonald 2006; Wang et al 2006a Wang et al , 2006b). This paper is the first of its kind to examine forest resources use by residents inside a Bhutan PA.

The elevation of the area ranges from 600m to 2100 m from sea level. More than 1000 visitors pay their visit to this hill resort daily. It is situated about 65km North of Islamabad. This area is geographically known as \" Foot hill of Himalayas \". Murree is very important location due to its forest cover mainly comprising of Chir pine and Blue pine forests; that not only provide timber, fuel wood, and other non-timber benefits to community but also serve as watershed area and a magnificent picnic spot. Eco-tourism is a multimillion enterprise in Murree. More than one million tourists visit Murree each year. The population of Murree grows up 10 times more than the local population during the hot summer spell in the country and winter season during snow fall. Most of the local people are associated directly or indirectly to this industry. In true sense, Ecotourism plays a vital role in the improvement of socioeconomic conditions of the local community. To find out the role of ecotourism and public preferences towards interest of nature conservation, a survey of visitors was conducted; using a structured questionnaire in three most busy locations, The Mall, Patriata and Bhurban. The reported onsite experiences of respondents were analyzed to identify important factors that motivated them to visit the site and had effect on their conservation attitudes and to assess the visitor's behavior towards forest based ecotourism and analyzed their preferences regarding \" quality ranking \" as a recreational spot and possible improvements for further recreational development without damaging the habitat. From a total samples of 180 respondents, 52.78 % preferred Muree Hill resort for the enjoyment from the view point of forests flora and fauna and natural beauty, 32.78% responded for general environment, 2.22% for near distance location and 5% did not specify any particular reason for their visit. There is significant relationship between the specific objective \" to enjoy scenery and forests \" and their first time visit or yearly visit to the forest area. The results of F-distribution at 95 % confidence interval showed significant relationship between specific objective \" to enhance knowledge \" and their first time visit or the yearly visit to the forest area. The enhanced knowledge about the environment and of forests causes awareness among visitors for the conservation of nature along with tourism development.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":377}

C.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Forests are essential resources for a large number of people, many of whom come from disadvantaged sections of society (based on per capita income, literacy rate, nutritional and health status and lack of access to social and technical services). Of India's population of over one billion 360 million live in or around the forest area (76.52 million ha, of which about 40% is considered degraded). This degradation of forests is mainly ascribed to the rigid state control and the resulting disempowerment and displacement of indigenous tribal and hill communities accompanied by the disintegration of community based resource management (Fernandes and Menon 1987; Guha 1991; Kelkar and Nathan 1991; Gadgil and Guha 1992). About 90% of India's forests is under state ownership (FSI 2000). Until the end of 19th century, at least 80% of India's natural resources were common property and the area under state control has increased progressively since British rule. Forestry was a central government subject until 1935 when it was transferred to the states. It remained a state subject even after independence. Central government concern with the rapid rate of deforestation resulted in the constitutional amendment of 1976 that made forests a concurrent subject. The responsibility of administration of forests lies primarily with the state governments but it is subject to central government legislations and directions. The Government of India's (GOI) 1988 forest policy paved the way for the implementation of Joint Forest Management (JFM). The programme was further promoted by a GOI circular to all states and union territories that provided guidelines for the Applying the sustainable livelihood approach to Joint Forest Management projects in India K.K. KAUSHAL 1 and J.C. KALA 2 Madurai, Tamilnadu, India. 2 Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Government of Tamilnadu, Chennai, India. Email: kkkaushal@eth.net SUMMARY The long-term success of Joint Forest Management (JFM) appears doubtful unless people's dependence on forests is reduced to nontimber forest produce, small timber, firewood for bonafide domestic use and indirect benefits. For this the issues of poverty alleviation, sustainable development, empowerment and forest regeneration have to be dealt with simultaneously. While elucidating the concept and approach of Sustainable Livelihoods (SL), this paper makes a case for its adoption in forest areas. Further it analyses the Tamilnadu Afforestation Project and its evolution into a Sustainable Livelihood Project. The paper concludes with the observation that JFM projects can be converted into SL projects through enhanced outlay for buffer zones, integration of line departments, increasing the duration and decentralisation of more powers to JFM institutions. Keywords: Tamilnadu Afforestation Project, Sustainable Livelihoods, Joint Forest Management, Village Forest Council, Assets 'involvement of village communities and voluntary agencies in the regeneration of degraded forests'. This document, for the first time, specifies the rights protecting communities over forestlands, giving the protectors usufructs such as grasses, NTFPs, ( non-timber forest products), and a portion of the proceeds (ranging from 20 to 100%) from the sale of trees when they mature. The circular exhorts the state Forest Departments to take full advantage of the expertise of committed voluntary agencies for building up meaningful people participation in the protection and development of degraded forestlands. In the ensuing years, 22 state governments have issued orders for implementation of JFM and the states have evolved their own mechanisms of involving local communities in conformity with the proclaimed policy. About 36,130 Village Forest Councils (VFC) are managing a total of 10.25 million ha of forest area in the country (FSI 2000). JFM is an evolving policy-based program, which sets out to establish management 'partnerships' between local forest-dependent communities and the state for the sustainable management and joint benefit sharing of public forestland (Sarin 1995b). To accomplish this, JFM seeks to shift the existing inequitable distribution of management control by directly involving local people and institutions in forest management (Campbell 1996). JFM does not involve the transfer of ownership over forests, but attempts instead to restructure the formal system of access, decisionmaking , and sharing of benefits to account for the needs of local communities. While many object to this fundamental limitation, proponents see JFM as a negotiating process, where the objectives of different users","doi":"10.1505/ifor.6.1.13.32059","journal":{"name":"Review","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":378}

The rationale for CNRM is often compelling and convincing. Relatively little data exists, however, regarding its implementation, particularly the reconciliation of social and environmental goals. This article summarizes empirical evidence regarding the implementation of CNRM, based on ve case studies in Nepal, the U.S. states of Alaska and Washington, and Kenya. Six social and environmental indicators are used to evaluate and compare these cases, including equity, empowerment, con ict resolution, knowledge and awareness, biodiversity protection, and sustainable resource utilization. The results of this analysis indicate that, despite sincere attempts and some success, serious dee ciencies are widely evident. In especially Nepal and Kenya, CNRM rarely resulted in more equitable distribution of power and economic benee ts, reduced conn ict, increased consideration of traditional or modern environmental knowledge, protection of biological diversity, or sustainable resource use. By contrast, CNRM in the North American cases was more successful. Institutional, environmental, and organizational factors help explain the observed differences.

R. and Guodong H. and Xiangyang H. and Michalk D. L. and Fujiang H. and Jianping W. and Yingjun Z. and Graham E. H.","dAbstract":"Grasslands occupy 40% of the world's land surface (excluding Ant-arctica and Greenland) and support diverse groups, from traditional extensive nomadic to intense livestock-production systems. Population pressures mean that many of these grasslands are in a degraded state, particularly in less-productive areas of developing countries, affecting not only productivity but also vital environmental services such as hydrology, biodiversity, and carbon cycles; livestock condition is often poor and household incomes are at or below poverty levels. The challenge is to optimize management practices that result in \" win-win \" outcomes for grasslands, the environment, and households. A case study is discussed from northwestern China, where it has been possible to reduce animal numbers considerably by using an energy-balance/market-based approach while improving household incomes, providing conditions within which grassland recovery is possible. This bottom-up approach was supported by informing and working with the six layers of government in China to build appropriate policies. Further policy implications are considered. Additional gains in grassland rehabilitation could be fostered through targeted environmental payment schemes. Other aspects of the livestock production system that can be modified are discussed. This work built a strategy that has implications for many other grassland areas around the world where common problems apply. degradation | herder G rasslands occupy ∼40% of the world's land area, excluding Antarctica and Greenland, supporting the livelihoods of ∼1 billion people (1). Many of these grasslands suffer some degradation as a result of increased pressures from people and livestock populations and the political belief that they were an underused resource. Many grassland areas now produce much of the world's grain crops, but, in less productive parts, an extension of cropping has resulted in considerable degradation, exacerbated by the aban-donment of nonviable cropping. New strategies are needed for the sustainability of these vast resources (2). Fortunately, many useful plant species are still present within these ecosystems, which means they could be managed to a healthier state. The Eurasian grasslands, extending from eastern China to Europe, form the largest set of interconnected grassland ecosystems on Earth, containing several thousand plant and other species. China has 400 million ha of grasslands (3), of which 300 million ha are in the north and west, supporting 16 million people directly (4) plus many more indirectly. These are 40% of the poorest people in China earning <$2 per head per day. Rehabilitation of grasslands is critical for poverty alleviation. The grasslands of China have been grazed by wild and then domesticated herbivores for millennia. During much of that time, the density of people and livestock was low, much grazing was in a transhumance system, grasslands had time to recover from grazing , and species adapted. More recently, grasslands were perceived as an underused resource. Today, grasslands are repeatedly grazed at higher stocking rates than were traditional, and the number of people dependent on them has dramatically increased. Across China, there are acknowledged problems on 90% of the grasslands (5). These include decreased ground cover, increased soil erosion, changes to less palatable species, and changes in associated fauna. The high density of livestock and people and reduced productivity of grasslands has reduced the sequestration of carbon and increased the net greenhouse gases released to the atmosphere (6)","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1208063110","journal":null,"aid":381}

G. and Vial C.","dAbstract":"Ecotourism is widely assumed to provide a mechanism for the maintenance of biodiversity. However, the perceptions of biodiversity by tourists have rarely been evaluated. We assessed this during self-guided wildlife viewing in the Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa, and evaluated the effects of guides on day-and night-drives on the tourists' perceptions of faunal biodiversity. Self-guided tourists recorded seeing few mammals, reptiles and birds, these being largely limited to the large, charismatic and open-habitat species. Self-guided tourists who had seen elephants expressed satisfaction with their wildlife viewing, although some expressed a wish to have seen other vertebrates. Tourists who participated in guided day-drives saw more species than self-guided tourists, while those who participated in guided night-drives saw the greatest diversity of vertebrates. In general, tourist interest in biodiversity was largely focused on a few vertebrates; while invertebrates (with the exception of the flightless dung beetle) and plants were largely ignored. We suggest that the quality of wildlife viewing may be significantly improved through the use of guides. Guiding offers an opportunity to expand the community involvement (through employing game-guides) and environmental education components of ecotourism. The findings of this study indicate that tourists focus on a few charismatic species and may hold misconceptions of the nature of biodiversity. We argue that the assumption of an umbrella role of a few charismatic species in protecting ecosystems and their constituent biodiversity is probably precarious. It is imperative that the public, and politicians who make decisions regarding the conservation of biodiversity, are sensitized to the value of biodiversity. Traditional self-guided wildlife viewing in conservation areas generally leads to the tourists having a lesser wildlife experience, which undervalues biodiversity as an ecotourism resource.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":383}

The traditional top– down approach to nature protection has been widely criticized for failing to include critical social elements in management practices, and is being gradually replaced by a slew of participatory strategies under the rubric of bottom-up conservation. The new approach recognizes local communities as key partners in wildlife management and seeks their participation in social development and biodiversity conservation. However, every social context is different in its structure and functions, and in the way social groups respond to calls for participation. In order to gain a better understanding of the approach and the barriers encountered in its implementation, a questionnaire survey of 188 households was employed in the communities of the Upper Mustang extension of Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) in Nepal. The study provides a comparative analysis of community participation and its barriers between Non-Tourist (NT) and Tourist (TV) villages. The results revealed important differences between the two groups in terms of their participation in community programs, barriers to participation, and perception of benefits from participation. Owing to their distinct spatial, demographic and attitudinal differences, the two village groups have their own sets of needs, values and motivation factors which cannot be generalized and treated as such. The research clearly identifies the need for the conservation agency to be creative in devising strategies and initiatives appropriate to specific social groups so as to optimize their input in par-ticipatory conservation.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-009-9405-6","journal":null,"aid":384}
{"filename":"Khan and Bhagwat 2010","year":2010,"title":"Protected Areas: A Resource or Constraint for Local People?","authors":"Khan M. S. and Bhagwat S. A.","dAbstract":"Introduction Protected areas (PAs) such as national parks and wildlife reserves now cover more than 12% of the Earth's surface and are considered an essential component of conservation strategies globally (Wells and McShane 2004; Bajracharya et al 2005). Although there is still considerable argument among conservationists about the representation and sufficiency of these areas and the occurrence of gaps in the existing networks (Brooks et al 2004; Rodrigues et al 2004; Monkkonen et al 2009), there is now a common consensus that an effective protected area network needs to be maintained. However, the PAs are effective only if they are managed efficiently. Good governance, therefore, is the key factor in strengthening the effectiveness of PAs (Smith et al 2003). The quality of governance is assessed based on various factors, including the involvement of key stakeholders in the process of decision-making (Dearden et al 2005). Conservation International's Biodiversity Hotspots is one of the most prominent global strategies for conservation (CI 2009). It has been suggested that hot spots of biodiversity also overlap with hot spots of poverty (Fisher and Christopher 2007). While the biodiversity hot spots in developing countries are at the front line of conservation efforts, they are also vulnerable to the pressures arising from persistent poverty and rapid and unchecked increases in local population. It is estimated that more than 1.1 billion people—nearly 20% of the world's population—with a growth rate (1.8% per year) higher than the population growth rate of the world as a whole (1% per year) are living within these hot spots (Cincotta et al 2000). The majority of these people are directly dependent upon protected areas within these hot spots for their basic needs. In some cases the declaration of PAs means that the local communities must not only forgo access to resources such as fuelwood, fodder, and other products such as medicinal plants but also suffer direct losses to crops and livestock-raiding by wild Mountain Research and Development (MRD) An international, peer-reviewed open access journal published by the International Mountain Society (IMS) www.mrd-journal.org animals inhabiting PAs (Sekhar 2003). Therefore, researchers have suggested that the identification of priority conservation areas should not be based on biological aspects alone. Instead, integration of both biological and social aspects should be considered within the identification process (Shi et al 2005; Pinto et al 2007). While perceived as difficult to attain, researchers have argued that it is possible to find win–win solutions to resolve or decrease the magnitude of overlap between poverty and conservation in these regions (Adams et al 2004Galvin and Haller 2008). Some researchers even suggest that voluntary conservation is the more economically and socially acceptable approach (Monkkonen et al 2009). For example, a number of conservation nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the United Kingdom depend on the contribution that volunteers make to the management and maintenance of various nature reserves (RSPB 2009). It is also apparent that comanagement efforts in the form of communitybased conservation projects have made it possible to help reduce the severity of these problems for the local people and management around national parks (Matose 2006). Communities in and around PAs have a long-standing relationship with the land in addition to dependency on its resources—for example, their cultural identity, spirituality, and subsistence practices are known to contribute to conservation of biological diversity on their land (Trakolis 2001). Implementing systems of managing PAs that exclude local communities or their participation has resulted in various conflicts and problems, such as dislocation, violence, poaching, and poverty among indigenous communities (Nepal 2002). These concerns have led to a growing recognition of the role of local people in the sustainable and effective management of PAs (Rao et al 2002). Comanagement, community-based conservation, and other systems of governance that involve local people in decision-making have recently become very popular in protected area management globally (Colfer et al 1999; Granek and Brown 2005). Effective governance, however, is not only about involvement of stakeholders; it is also about the execution of power, who has how much influence, who makes the decisions, and how decision-makers are held accountable (Graham et al 2003). Although the answers to many of these questions are directly linked to national policies, they also reflect the institutional policies of the organizations working at the grass roots. Researchers have observed an increasing trend toward greater participation by stakeholders and the use of formal accountability mechanisms to guarantee the legitimacy and effectiveness of grassroots organizations (Paavola 2004; Dearden et al 2005). The Hindu Kush–Himalayan region is 1 of the 34 biodiversity hot spots in the world. While rich in biodiversity, it is also a densely populated region faced with severe poverty. The efforts to establish a network of protected areas in this region of HKH are relatively recent. For example, the first protected area in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan was established in the early 1980s (Wildlife of Pakistan 2007). Very little research has been done to assess the strength of current governance of PAs, how these governance regimes change over time, and the main factors that can potentially affect future governance. Although Pakistan has an extensive PA network in regions of high biodiversity, that is, Himalaya and Hindu Kush (WCPA 2003), these PAs were designated without any involvement of local communities and are governed by the forest management laws set out during the British colonial period (Ribbentrop 2004). The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the current PA governance model to determine the levels of awareness, perception, involvement, and participation of local communities. The article reviews the literature on the formation of PAs in NWFP and makes an assessment of the existing model of PA governance based on comprehensive surveys and informal interviews with key stakeholders. The article also makes a number of recommendations for effective management of the PAs. The study was carried out at Chitral Gol National Park (CGNP), and some of the keyinformant interviews were conducted at Peshawar, where the administrative offices of the national park are located.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Source: Mountain Research and Development","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":386}

The role of 2 networks—a community forest user group network (CFN) and a women's group network (WN)—in environmental governance was the main focus of a participatory study using simple tools such as focus group discussions and key informant interviews with executive committee members of the networks, community members in the individual member groups, and IUCN project and program staff. The WN and the CFN are federations of more than 60 women's groups and community forest user groups (CFUGs) in the project area. The executive committees of those networks are elected by a general assembly of constituents on a periodic basis and are accountable to their members. The networks strengthen the capacity of community groups to conserve and use natural resources in a sustainable manner through capacity building and awareness-raising activities in the Siwaliks ecozone (Figure 1). The CFN generates income primarily by selling forest products according to community forestry operational plans, whereas the WN is based on a membership fee paid by constituents . Both networks receive external support for implementing development activities, including support from IUCN Nepal.

In this study we examined how conservation attitudes in western Serengeti are shaped by the following factors: level of conflicts with protected areas; wildlife imposed constraints (inadequate pasture, water, diseases, loss of livestock during migration, theft and depredation); participation in the community based project; and socio-demographic factors (age, education level, wealth, immigration, gender and household size). The results indicated that the level of conflicts, participation in the community based project, inadequate pasture, lack of water, diseases, wealth and education were important in shaping peoples' attitudes. However, in a stepwise linear regression analysis, 59% of the variation in peoples' attitudes was explained by three variables i.e., conflict level with protected areas, lack of water and participation in the community based project. In addition to these variables, level of education also contributed in explaining 51% of the variation in people's attitude regarding the status of the game reserves. Five variables (lack of water, level of education, inadequate pasture, participation in the Ó Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006 community based project and diseases) explained 12% of the variation in people's attitude towards Serengeti National Park. The paper discusses the implications for conservation of these results and recommends some measures to realise effective conservation of wildlife resources.","doi":"10.1007/s10531-006-9132-8","journal":{"name":"Biodivers Conserv","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":392}

Villagers, foresters, park employees, entrepreneurs and environmentalists were surveyed. The survey applied a multi-group social choice method, following six steps: (i) identification of all relevant social states for sustainable forest management; (ii) elicitation of preferences, for different social states, of forest user groups' members; (iii) determination of attributes of users and social states; (iv) aggregation of individual forest value preferences into social value preferences; (v) inter-group comparison of preferences; and (vi) estimation of predictors of social forest value preferences. A distinction is made between the household-perspective and the citizen-perspective of evaluations. As well, socioeconomic and institutional-legal attributes of stakeholders were tested as predictors of stakeholder preferences. The major findings include the following. First, non-consumptive forest uses, including ecosystem services, were given highest priority by all stakeholders. Second, consumptive values were weighted more discriminately, while non-consumptive values were viewed more holistically. Third, forest dependence and environmental-resource-entitlements lead to more household consumption-based valuations; whereas, the appreciation of diverse forest values increases with the education of people. Fourth, the stakeholders exercise higher consensus on the importance of non-consumptive uses when such values are evaluated in the context of societal needs but not as household needs; consumptive uses registered the opposite effect. This finding signifies the separation between individual-conscience and social-conscience corresponding with the evaluation of consumer needs and societal needs, respectively. Thus, societal allocations, such as biodiversity conservation or ecosystem services, must be based on valuations specifically formulated in the context of eliciting collective social judgments.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2010.02.007","journal":null,"aid":393}

H.","dAbstract":"The idealization of natural landscapes and peoples during colonialism, coupled with the popularity of sustainable development in the postcolonial era, has contributed to the expansion of conservation planning throughout the African continent. Concerns surrounding the promotion of national and international conservation agendas at the expense of local livelihood needs have generated interest in community conservation projects that attempt to include local participation and knowledge in natural resource management. The early excitement associated with community conservation has waned in light of recent assessments that it has been unsuccessful in meeting its ecological and social goals. This parallels other research that suggests communities are understood in generic or homogenous ways that inXuence how these initiatives are understood. Using a case study of the Mahushe Shongwe Game Reserve, this paper evaluates how rural households access environmental and economic resources to produce livelihoods, and how these access patterns impact their views of the project. It is argued that there are signiWcant livelihood variations within the community that shape the ways households engage with, and beneWt from, conservation planning. Rather than strictly viewing Mahushe Shongwe as a constraint to environmental resource access or site for limited employment, community members identify a number of beneWts from its existence including education and development opportunities. Additionally, transformations in governance systems in the region impact community views of the project since younger residents are less likely to engage with the Matsamo Tribal Authority, which participates in managing the reserve. The consequence is that conservation has various impacts and meanings within a speciWc community that remain tied to the livelihood and governance systems being renegotiated in the post-apartheid era.","doi":"10.1016/j.geoforum.2006.08.001","journal":{"name":"Geoforum","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":395}

This paper uses a case study of the Mahushe Shongwe Game Reserve in South Africa to examine the key variables shaping community perceptions of community conservation. We employ multinomial logistic regression models to understand views of the benefits and future direction of the reserve. These models are coupled with information collected from semi-structured interviews that assists in providing a detailed, and more complex, understanding of the diverse ways that community conservation is perceived by local residents. The paper demonstrates that multiple factors, particularly household history, education, and gender contribute in shaping views of the reserve. While these variables are often identified in the academic literature as important, we argue that the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods helps reveal the interplay between them in shaping perceptions of community conservation.","doi":"10.1007/s10745-010-9319-1","journal":null,"aid":396}

This scenario has seen the re-emergence of dominant and swaying positions of view that point to entrusting a significant authority to the state to look after the world's habitats for fauna as protected areas (Terborgh 1999). This has witnessed a transition in the approach of protected area implementation, that sought to directly link forest and/or natural resource conservation with local livelihoods to the traditional, exclusionary 'fortress parks' (Kamugisha et al. 1997; Kiss 1990; Rutten 2002). Many conservationists still believe that unless local livelihoods and resource conservation efforts are made to be compatible, there is little or no future for conservation (McNeely and Miller 1984; Salafsky and Wollenberg 2000; Western et al. 1994). Although recent years have seen an increase in documented evidence of reasonably successful cases 'integrated conservation and development programs' (ICDPs) linked to community-driven conservation (CDC) in varied parts of tropical Africa, there have equally been several cases of distressing results regarding the re-emergence of the state-centred approaches in natural resource management (Laris 2003). This new phenomenon represents a contradiction to the approaches which seek to link environmental conservation with development. Such a shift has resulted into a growing tension between people and conservation, hence prompting a rejuvenated debate about the implications of the re-emergence of the 'fines and fences' approach to the integration of human populations to the objectives of natural resource preservation. This is what Hutton et al. (2005) have referred to as back to the barriers. Put differently, the new phenomenon symbolizes a relatively straightforward construction of change through time, but we end up with a sense of 'plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose'. Much does not change; much that appears in new masks underlying attitudes and processes that persists unchanged; the changes that really need to happen are not taking place. It is therefore noteworthy that in the shifting contest between participation, exclusion and resource exploitation, it is the players who change and their roles and political contexts that shift, rather than the ideas behind people's thinking (Haiwood 2009). Thriving programmes in the realm of Integrated Natural Resource Management (INRM), particularly, in the forestry sector have demonstrated that a range of aspects need to be put into consideration for successful conservation performance. Among these is the need to implement real and meaningful participation of local populations as a critical element in determining the success of any conservation or development regime (Laris 2002; Makumbi et al. 2001). But in spite of widespread One of the critical requirements for successful performance of conservation programmes in forest reserves that also inhabits people is that local populations must participate in the creation, planning and management of the reserve. The problems in case of the Kakamega Forest Reserve demonstrate that local participation is not an option, but a must. A forest reserve governed by formal institutions alone cannot effectively work, as the forest is a resource that is linked to the peoples' feelings. On that note, the local people cannot be treated as pawns of externally enforced mechanical act. Local people should be invited and actively involved to take part in institutional and management discussions. This calls for a fundamental shift in the approach to conservation and participation of local populations. Poor governance is one of the key characteristics that has been highlighted to cause the failure of tropical forest resource conservation (Brack 2009; Bruce et al. 2002). Again, the Kakamega scenario affords a glowing example. Therefore, good governance characterized by transparency, accountability and representation of a multiplicity of interests is one of the key ingredients needed to correct some of the wrongs in Kakamega forest management. In most of the communities visited, the community members expressed a high level of dissatisfaction in respect to the current forest leadership, especially on the side of the government extension workers and forest wardens. There were reported cases of corruption, lack of communication and community consultation, and general inefficiency of leaders from the Forestry Services and the Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS). In most cases, the community members reported that forest wardens were, for example, taking bribes from external resource extractors to allow illegal extraction of timber and related resources from reserved territory, without consultation with the community. In other cases, forest authorities were believed to be using taxes and fines collected from the forest for their own wants. The most common complaints, however, regarded the lack of recognition regarding the control and sanctions used by community authorities, both against outside invaders and against community members who were seen to be over-harvesting resources. Further still, there are no institutionalized efforts to resolve intra-and intercommunity conflicts. Effective participation requires efforts from both external protected area stakeholders and the communities themselves. Institutional limitations and conflicts at the national, regional and local levels hindered the participation of local populations and have resulted in overall failure in the management of its natural resources. At the national level, the drawbacks concern the general policy context, which currently fails to support regional initiatives and bottom–up approaches for conservation. At the regional level, the institutional weaknesses consist of poor inter-organizational relationships and misfits that limit co-ordination and collaboration between stakeholders, adding delay and difficulty to the process of reserve implementation. At the community level, the main challenges hindering institutional development for sustainable management of natural resources relate to social organization and governance of communities, as well as undefined property rights. The challenges that external stakeholders face in recognizing, defining and agreeing upon participatory methods in protected area management are many. The behaviour of protected area stakeholders is an interaction of a complex and multifaceted institutional environment that requires a collaborative relationship which can only work in the long term if the terms of reference are clearly defined and agreed upon. This requires the conscious effort on behalf of actors, a balance of power and negotiating skills, and calls for institutional changes in the policy context. The challenge lies in designing appropriate institutional mechanisms that encourage the spread of local participation, with directors of all government resources agencies, members of public, NGO and private sector conservation organizations, radically restructuring procedures and working relationships both within and between organizations. Although the local communities within and around Kakamega Forest Reserve are faced with numerous challenges in achieving successful community-oriented conservation, local institutional assets such as local knowledge, values and institutional heritage remain valuable to any attempt geared towards construction of any localized solutions. This must, however, be seen in light of the state-led socio-economic and political injustices that are committed against the peasants and forest dwellers in the tropical world. As Vandana (1999) in his article entitled 'voices unheard and unheeded' puts it, in the recent times, causes of biodiversity loss in the tropics have been linked to governmental and international support for industrial forestry, agriculture and energy programmes over and above traditional usage patterns. The introduction of exotic species and animals causes disturbances to ecosystems because the checks and balances that hold the equilibrium in the native ecosystem do not apply to the introduced species. In the same way, when foreign capital and technology are introduced into traditional social economic systems, the checks and balances that keep the activities of the local communities to a sustainable level do not apply. Yet without these, indigenous patterns and controls as a communal decision making and ownership are lost (1991: 21). Therefore, in agreement with Chin et al. (1989), the resurgent state-level management of biodiversity spots such as forestry belt like Kakamega has led to the erosion of respect for human rights including the right to decision making. And without doubt, in absence of these rights, state-based environmental protection is weak, untold suffering for local people and environmental despoliation is the outcome. Attempts to increased community-oriented management need to recognize that existing institutional enforcement mechanisms in Kakamega ought to work in a harmonious manner, in order to uphold what already exists within the Luhya 150 F REDRICK KISEKKA-NTALE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RURAL MANAGEMENT, 5(2), 2009: 145–173 resource management setting. In this study, it was observed that there is ample evidence of local people's willingness to engage in institutional dialogue if there is sufficient information, communication and trust. It is needless to say that this can only happen when new resource management institutional enforcement mechanisms are appreciated and perceived to be beneficial and as long as decisions are not externally imposed. Furthermore, the local communities in Kakamega Forest Reserve do possess some fairly effective institutions, but few relate to resource mobilization and management. There are, for instance, no strong sanctions to deter the abuse of common property. Although the communities are loosely structured, people's social networks such as family, sub-tribal and clan kinships, neighbours, friends still form the pivot to execute the local rules. Some of the communities seemed to be lacking in terms of internal communication between households. In addition, rivalry was witnessed in several cases among non-Luhya tribes and families, often due to economic interests in land and related resources, or conflicts in resource harvesting, which demonstrates an auxiliary weakness in the political organization and its capacity to resolve internal conflicts. It is also imperative to mention that despite the rhetoric of observing international conservation covenants, signatories to covenants like Kenya often contradict them in practice. For instance, at the close of the 1990s and late 2005, because of actions which are contrary to both trends elsewhere in the world and its own obligations under the International Conservation Union (IUCN), Conference of Parties (COP) and Convention of Biodiversity (CBD), Kenya as a country is still faced with a challenge where several thousands of people are displaced and others are threatened with displacement by a series of Central Government orders on wildlife and forests conservation. Yet it was as recent as 2002 when the Kenyan Government had committed itself to meeting the targets under the CBD, moving towards full legal and institutional arrangements as well as participation of local communities in the management of forestry and wildlife conservation, and in receiving benefits from such conservation, by 2006. However, the situation in Kakamega contradicts Kenya's commitment to the above international regimes. Lastly, local institutional development for community-oriented conservation has received little systematic attention in previous literature. If protected area management is to be sustainable, then researchers, practitioners and conservationists must pay closer attention to the architecture and performance of institutions involved in sustainable forest management. Once these institutions are better understood, local institutional development is of great urgency, for the participation of local people in managing forest resources is crucial to successful conservation.","doi":"10.1177/097300521000500202","journal":{"name":"International Journal of Rural Management Downloaded from International Journal of Rural Management","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":398}

Estas políticas han ignorado el proceso de construcción social que ha generado desigualdad y marginación en el acceso a los recursos forestales. Este artículo sostiene que las diversas disposiciones institucionales y sus relaciones son de vital importancia para determinar qué actores sociales controlan y acceden a sus propios recursos naturales locales.

Although the policy outcomes are far less straightforward than the perspective's conceptual foundation, this linkage between conservation and livelihoods has substantial to achieve outcomes that simultaneously address two crucial problems faced by developing countries: poverty and reducing deforestation, as well as enhancing conservation (Sunderlin et al. 2005). Numerous action plans seek \" win-win \" outcomes where livelihood improvements are paired with achieving environmental protection (Sunderlin et al. 2005). Since the 1980s, many developing countries in Asia and Africa witnessed a shift in the forest resource management paradigm from state controlled management to community-oriented forest management. Conservation policies and practices have also changed significantly, and people-oriented approaches have been widely accepted and adopted since then (Brown 2003). As in any other part of the world, over the last two decades Bangladesh has pursued various initiatives to check its continuing depletion of forest resources and conserve biodiversity while securing the livelihoods and sustainable development of forest communities. However, the results of the CFM efforts over the past two decades indicated that despite the potential, many of the CFM initiatives in Bangladesh remain limited in scope and unable to adequately address the demands of forest communities (Koli 2010a). The extent to which new conservation or community based conservation can support poverty alleviation remains a matter of debate. Therefore, focusing on people oriented forest policy initiatives , this paper intends to understand whether and to what extent these initiatives can address the social vulnerability of forest communities in Bangladesh. This paper found that despite the potential of CFM, the community based policy initiatives pursued in Bangladesh fail to address the dynamic relationships among the formal and informal institutions that largely shape the rights and access of forest communities to forest resources. These policies ignored the process of social construction that produced the inequality and marginalisation that have largely determined how forest communities can gain access and control over the use of forest resources. This paper argues that various types of institutional arrangements and the relationships among them are of central importance in determining which social actors gain access to and control over their local natural resources. This, in turn, contributes to the forest communities' limited ability to ensure their livelihoods , basic needs and their capacity to cope with adverse circumstances such as climate induced hazards. This argument will be illustrated with reference to the development of forest policy and a case study of a community based conservation initiative in Bangladesh. The paper is organised as follows. Following an introduction to the analytical framework, this section outlines the concept of social vulnerability based on the environmental entitlements framework along with the conservation and development literature. It will define the key terms, tracing their origins in INTRODUCTION In recent decades, the complementarities and conflicts between bio-diversity conservation and human development have continued to be the subject of heated academic and policy debates (Brown 2003). Despite these debates, there is a general consensus that conservation policy has changed significantly towards sustainable forest management through a community centred or people oriented approach. A key tenet of sustainable forest management is that it must not only be ecologically sound but also economically viable and socially responsible. This integrated approach perceives substantial potential is not only addressing forest conservation but also the well being and the social vulnerability of forest communities . All around the globe, forest communities are among the most socially vulnerable. Many of the world's poorest and most politically marginalised individuals are concentrated in forests and are dependent on these forests for their livelihoods . According to a World Bank report, 1.3 billion people live on environmentally fragile land, including forest ecosystems , and a large number of them suffer from extreme poverty (World Bank 2003). Compared to other economic and social sectors, forest areas and forest-related institutions tend to be especially characterised by unclear property rights, remoteness from public scrutiny and repressive state actions (Frances 2008). Moreover, forests and forest-dependent communities across the globe have become one of the prime victims of climate change. According to the fourth scientific assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), over the past half century, climate change has affected numerous aspects of forest ecosystems and will likel y accelerate over the course of this century (IPCC 2007). This situation is particularly relevant for the Sundarbans forest area in Bangladesh, where more than 3.5 million people are dependent on natural resources and have already been heavily affected by the impacts of present day climate hazards and forest degradation. The community forest management (CFM) paradigm thus became imperative in a number of fields such as sustainable forest management, community based conservation, community based natural resource management (CBNRM), poverty alleviation and so on. There is no precise definition of CFM; in general, it refers to community-based activities geared towards the sustainable use of forests. Thus, CFM can range from traditional community based forest management to the initiatives of NGOs, forestry departments and donor agencies to include the local community in forest management. The re-emergence of CFM largely occurred due to a paradigm shift in conservation theory, which is sometimes termed \" new conservation \" (Brown 2002, Hulme and Murphree 1999, Salafsky and Wollenberg 2000). Over the past three decades this new conservation has brought about several significant shifts in the previous understandings such as shifting the societal locus of conservation from the state to the local community and acknowledging human intervention in conservation through the sustainable use of forest resources rather than protectionism (Hulme and Murphree 1999). It stresses the direct or indirect linkages between conservation the broader literature and specifying the distinctive features of the framework employed in this study. Then, the study's methodology is outlined before a brief review of forest policies in Bangladesh. It presents a case study of the Sundarbans mangrove forest in Bangladesh to characterise the CBNRM approaches to addressing the social vulnerability of forest communities and finds that they are flawed in how they characterise the communities and their institutional and local environmental context. It discusses how the micro (local level) and macro level institutions are perceived that ignore both the history and power relationships and hinder the entitlement of forest communities. Finally, the conclusion considers some implications of the policy and CBNRM experiences with respect to addressing the social vulnerability of forest communities to climate change. ENVIRONMENTAL ENTILEMENT FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND SOCIAL VULNERABILITY This study employs the environmental entitlement framework , which is in part intended to address the social vulnerability of forest communities and provide a critical response to the key aspects of the CBNRM approach. The concept of social vulnerability is useful to explain the vulnerable situation of forest communities with respect to climate change, as it regards the state of individuals, groups and communities in terms of their ability to cope with and adapt to any external stress placed on their livelihoods. This vulnerability is determined by the availability of resources, crucially, by the endowments and entitlements of individuals and groups to these resources (Adger and Kelly 1999, Bohle et al. 1994). In the case of Bangladesh, the forest communities in the Sundarbans mangrove forest suffer from not only the biophysical problem of climate change but also their inability to cope with and adapt to this external stress placed on their livelihoods. The key argument of this paper is that despite its potential, the CBNRM based CFM was unable to substantially address the social vulnerability of these forest communities. It ignored the social process by which inequality and marginalisation were constructed, which largely determined how the forest communities were able to gain access and control over the use of forest resources. To explain this argument, the paper employs the entitlement framework, which can be initially traced in the literature to Sen's analysis of vulnerability to food insecurity and famine (Sen 1981Sen , 1990). Sen argues that scarcity does not denote the absence of sufficient resources but rather that the people do not have enough of them (Sen 1981). Sen emphasises that entitlements refer to individual rights to a range of possibilities of what people can have, not the normative sense of a right of what people should have. In the literature on entitlements and food security, adaptation is considered a stress response in light of access to resources and the ability of people to cope. This entitlement framework was subsequently extended by a number of scholars including Sen in a later work where the focus was on both individuals' endowments and entitlements (Dreze and Sen 1989). Endowments refer to the rights and resources that social actors have such as land, labour, skills and so on, and entitlements refer to legitimate effective command over an alternative commodity bundle (Gasper 1993, Leach, Mearns and Scoones 1999). Entitlements thus enhance capabilities, which are what individuals can do or be using their entitlements (Leach, Mearns and Scoones 1999). Sen emphasises that 'capabilities', which refer to the 'freedom' of individuals or households to choose paths and participate in activities that increase their quality of life (Clark 2006, Sen 1984, 1985, 1987), have become a key component of the sustainable livelihood concept. The pioneered work on sustainable livelihood which largely traced to the studies of Robert Chambers and Gordon Conway sought to broaden the conceptualization of livelihood security through incorporating the ideas of capabilities (Sen 1984), assets (Swift 1989), equity, and sustainability (WCED 1987). \" A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future, while not undermining the natural resource base. \" (Carney 1998: 4) In Bangladesh, the vulnerability of forest communities is crucially related to livelihood insecurity. The entitlement framework is thus useful to analyse the social vulnerability of forest communities in Bangladesh. Vulnerability itself is equivalent to the capacity (or lack thereof) to obtain access to necessary resources. The concept of entitlements encompasses the 'ability to make effective use of' or in other words access environmental resources (Mearns 1996 ). This entitlement not only means that poor forest communities obtain a disproportionate share of their livelihoods from their natural resources, but they also exercise command over their natural resources as a result of their ownership or their membership in particular groups and their ability to make effective use of those resource bundles (Leach, and Mearns, 1991, Leach, Mearns and Scoones 1999, Mearns 1996 ). This environmental entitlement thus explains the response capacity and ability of poor forest communities to cope with and to adapt with stresses and crises resulting from physical hazards. The social construction of vulnerability is therefore crucial and is largely determined by the socioeconomic structure and property relationships (Adger and Kelly 1999, Blake et al. 1994, Watts and Bohle 1993). The aim of this paper is to examine the social vulnerability of forest communities in Bangladesh by understanding how the patterns of access to resources are constructed and how they construct the livelihood of the poor forest communities , as well their ability to cope with stress. To understand who has legitimate command over forest resources, the framework focuses on two primary levels of analysis. The first concerns the individual or/and community level (groups of individuals) sources of entitlement from the local level institutional context, and the second applies to the broader institutional context such as the development of national forest policy within which the entitlements are formed and distributed among the communities. The framework devotes considerable attention to the institutions are operating at different levels, from macro to micro. The term institution refers to the rules that humans employ when interacting within a wide variety of repetitive and structured situations at multiple levels of analysis (North 2005, Ostrom 2005). Within this environmental entitlement framework, an analysis of the material sources of entitlement at the individual level, the distribution of those entitlements at the community level and the institutional context within which the entitlements are formed, contested and distributed over time and among groups can form the basis for assessing social vulnerability (Adger and Kelly 1999). Access to resources and community or individual claims to resources are often contested, and certain social actors or groups of these social actors may have different levels of legitimacy. The relationships among various groups within a 'community' and their power dynamics are crucial to understand both their endowment of and entitlement to resources. To understand this power relationship, the framework focuses on the local CFM institution, which is crucial in determining which social actors or groups are able to obtain more access to and control over their local natural resources. To understand the institutional settings at the local level and their influence on the environmental entitlements of forest communities, this study focuses on a case study on Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest, which is one of the environments most vulnerable to climate change. This individual level vulnerability, which we can determine by the forest communities' access to forest resources and the diversity of their sources of livelihoods, is also linked to the broader institutional structure and the political econom y of the market (Adger and Kelly 1999). Entitlements to the use of resources at the local level are largely determined by the institutions of the state and are legitimised by formal laws. The study thus focuses on CBNRM policies and approaches at the national level, which shape the local endowments and entitlements of certain groups in certain local areas. National policies regarding forest resources or to address social vulnerability are also directly and indirectly informed by international donor agencies, their projects, the broader current political economy and the historical legacy of the past political economy.","doi":"10.1505/146554813807700100","journal":null,"aid":402}

Drawing on official documents, as well as interviews and observations in four indigenous communities that participate in PSB, we discuss the role of local participation in conservation monitoring. The PSB's incentive and control approach has to some extent supported the establishment and financing of forest monitoring systems in indigenous communities. However, we argue that PSB in its current design exerts a conservation gap because it does not include animal species diversity and abundance as important components for successful long-term forest conservation. Supporting a bottom-up participatory monitoring methodology for locally-based conservation action can increase the existing positive conservation attitudes among community members. We provide specific examples of how animal species conservation and participatory monitoring can be combined and carried out.","doi":"10.1080/21513732.2013.822930","journal":{"name":"International Journal of Biodiversity Science","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":404}

Their habitat has been highly modified and degraded by human activities, often resulting in dramatic declines in their abundance and range (Reeves et al., 2000). Protection of freshwater dolphins and their habitat is a major challenge because river systems are utilized for transport, fishing and industrial processes. Rivers are also affected by forest fires, which are more likely to occur near rivers because these areas are easily accessible to people (Fuller & Fulk, 1998). Fires, along with illegal logging practices, probably increase sedimentation rates (Anon., 2000) with consequent disruption of aquatic ecosystems (Mackinnon et al., 1997). The facultative freshwater river dolphin Orcaella brevirostris is found in shallow, coastal waters of the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific and in three major river systems: the Mahakam in East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo, the Ayeyarwady in Myanmar, and the Mekong passing through Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos (Stacey & Arnold, 1999). Preliminary studies have indicated that these river populations each consist of <100 individuals (Kreb, 2002; Smith et al., 2003). Based on data we collected during 1999 and 2000, the Red List status of the Mahakam freshwater population was changed from Data Deficient to Critically Endangered (IUCN, 2004). In Indonesia the species is commonly and locally referred to as Irrawaddy dolphin and pesut, respectively. Since 1990 the species has been fully protected by law in Indonesia and is the adopted symbol of East Kalimantan Province. A 2-month preliminary study in 1997 revealed the sighting rate in the middle segment of the Mahakam River, believed to have the highest dolphin densities, was low (0.06 individuals per km; Kreb, 1999). To examine and monitor the status of the population in the Mahakam River, and to identify threats and develop Conservation of river dolphins in Indonesia a rationale for conservation action, a detailed study was carried out from February 1999 to August 2002. Here we present the results of this study, an analysis of the species' habitat preferences and population dynamics, examine the threats to the population, and make recommendations for future conservation activities.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605305000426","journal":{"name":"Oryx Oryx","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":405}

P. and Chhetri S. and Singh K. K.","dAbstract":"Man–BR interactions in Sikkim Ecological management of nature reserves is an important example of a sound  work for landscape ecology that includes both natural and cultural landscapes. An assessment of the situation virtually at the inception of the KBR, involving surveys along the fringe areas and in villages, shed light on settlement structures, the socioeconomic fabric, traditional agricultural practices and management, and patterns of resource use. The human population living close to this BR is highly dependent on forests in the buffer zones, be it for nontimber forest products (NTFPs)—including extraction of medicinal herbs, litter, wild edible fruits, and other minor forest products (MFPs)—or for timber, fodder, fuelwood, and open grazing. It was found that the dependency in such settlements ranged from 50% to 75% with respect to forest resource use, for example, 50–90% of fodder is collected in forested areas (Table  1 ). Although timber cutting is strictly prohibited , it seems difficult to stop the collection of fodder and fuelwood. This is likely to have long-term effects on habitats and eradicate some flora and fauna in the KBR. Increased habitat degradation may lead to adverse effects on rare or endangered flowering species such as rhododendrons (Figure 2 )—a keystone species acting as a biodiversity indicator of the region. In terms of fauna, high-altitude regions of the BR are home to rare and endangered animal species such as the snow leopard, the Himalayan red panda, the musk deer, the Tibetan sheep, the blue sheep, and many others. Strict conservation efforts may be required to protect the habitats of such species; this will be essential and unavoidable in fulfilling the objectives of this BR. In the last 10 years the population of Sikkim has increased by approximately 33%, thus putting even more pressure on resources. In the fringe areas, livelihood options such as traditional farming, pastoralism , and tourism exist. Agriculture is at the subsistence level, with dependency on natural resources in the surrounding forest exceeding 60%. Fringe areas were characterized by socioeconomic  tions under which annual income per household ranged from US$685 to US$1657 and literacy from 30% to 98%, with predominantly school-level education . The practice of livestock rearing to supplement agriculture and generate direct income is quite prevalent. Open grazing (eg, yaks grazing on alpine pastures , seeFigure 3) is practiced for the most part, with limited stall feeding. The use of NTFPs and medicinal herbs is a common form of supplementary income.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Source: Mountain Research and Development","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":406}

A partnership between scientists, educators, and local administrators on an evaluation program has been developed to evaluate a model of education program evaluation that includes short-and long-term evaluation of (1) knowledge and attitude change, (2) behavior change, and (3) positive biological impact. Previous work has shown short-term knowledge retention from this education program. In the current study follow-up evaluations were collected from students at 14 schools outside the Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda. By comparing performance 30 days, 1 year and 2 years after the initial program we demonstrate that knowledge gain from this program is not transient. However, although knowledge is a prerequisite for appropriate conservation actions it does not guarantee appropriate behaviors will be performed. Anecdotal evidence of behavior change and positive biological impact is discussed within the context of the challenges with changing behavior and evaluating the true biological impacts of those behaviors. Ultimately, conservation professionals will need to partner with educators and social scientists to effectively measure the impact of conservation education and human-based conservation programs on primate populations and their habitat.

The fishery is based on introduced fish species that are not native to the lake. The lake ecosystem is very fragile, as reflected in its fluctuating fish catches. The fishery almost completely collapsed in 2001, due partly to mismanagement and ignorance about needed conservation measures. The Kenyan government, like many governments around the world, recognized the need to involve fishers and other stakeholders, in order to ensure better management of the lake fisheries resources. Also referred to as collaborative management (co-management), this management approach provides the opportunity to share responsibility for managing the fishery resources between the government and the community. A total ban on fishing was imposed in February 2001, lasting for 1 year, to allow lake fish stocks to recover. This study analyses the co-management process for Lake Naivasha, and discusses the role played by the community during the fishing ban, as well as the successes and challenges encountered, and the tribulations and perceptions of the fishers regarding the new management strategy.

Differences in attitudes across seven main areas are investigated, including the positive and negative economic outcomes of tourism; positive and negative sociocultural impacts; negative environmental impacts; views on further tourism development, and benefits and problems related to forested land close to destinations. The results reveal that some attitudes are held in common – especially positive attitudes including tourism's benefits in creating jobs and income. Differences were mostly observed not in the direction but in the strength of opinion. The most significant differences were found in managers' beliefs that tourism's environmental and social impacts were few, while residents were extremely negative about those impacts. Differences of attitudes on the future use of forestland headed the list of all differences between managers and residents. Divergent loyalties were revealed. Managers supported their business and employers; local people supported their local area.

Community attitude and intention toward four dimensions of ecotourism, including conservation of natural resources, preservation of cultural tradition, sustainable community development, and participation in ecotourism planning and management, were measured. Furthermore, the paper examines whether or not there is congruence between community attitude and intention toward ecotourism development. Analysis is based on data collected using face-to-face questionnaire interviews in two indigenous communities consisting primarily of the Paiwan ethnic group. The study findings show that local people hold generally positive views of the measures necessary to achieve ecotourism; however, their intentions to engage in behaviors to support these measures do not entirely match with their positive views. This suggests that while local residents may support ecotourism development based on international guidelines, their intentions to act will depend on local environmental, social, and politico-economic conditions. It is suggested that issues related to community empowerment, relationship between government and communities, value conflicts introduced by ecotourism development, and the dynamics among and between various community groups will need to be addressed if positive community intention to participate in ecotourism is to be encouraged. r","doi":"10.1016/j.tourman.2005.11.010","journal":{"name":"Tourism Management","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":414}

M.","dAbstract":"Recent debates on human displacement caused by conservation have increasingly questioned: fi rstly, its justifi cation in the name of biodiversity conservation; and secondly, the effectiveness of compensation in preventing impoverishment. Land compensation is widely practiced and it is a crucial part of contemporary people-centred conservation resettlement strategies. In this article, using the case of the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in Nepal, I argue that policy-makers' belief that the social impacts of dislocation can be properly mitigated by economic-focused resettlement programmes alone is a myth. They have ignored the close relationships between place, social networks and livelihoods. A study of a displaced indigenous community known as Rana Tharus in far-western Nepal shows that a strong sense of nostalgia and homesickness is evident in this community. Displaced Ranas continue to idealise their old abode as 'paradise on Earth' while experiencing their new home as only promoting poverty, helplessness and danger. Their anger is due to the fact that they no longer have the mutual help or support from their neighbours as they once did in their old abode. From the Ranas' point of view, the old land had both high economic and social value. The study demonstrates that the act of displacement is a violent disruption of a community's daily social contacts. The destruction of the Ranas' social networks has not only led to their dispossession and threatened their livelihoods, but has also made them vulnerable, because these traditional social webs provided important alternative livelihoods in a rural economy. As a consequence, it has further reinforced their sense of nostalgia. The cultural and social meanings of land must be obtained prior to implementing any resettlement policies. The study indicates that if displacement is truly unavoidable for conserving biodiversity, more comprehensive rehabilitation resettlement policies than those that currently exist are needed.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.92146","journal":null,"aid":416}

We conducted a case study of a small MPA in Northern Philippines to understand socioeconomic status and livelihoods of the fishermen stakeholders, and examine their attitudes and perceptions on marine resource values and conservation. Using an ordered probit model, we also investigated factors affecting these perceptions. We found a lower fish income ratio in higher income quartiles, a small share of local non-fishery income, and an apparent lack of other livelihood opportunities within the rural economy. The majority of fishermen had positive perceptions of the non-market value of marine resources, agreed with the need for MPAs, and perceived positive potential income benefit from MPAs. Level of education and fishing income were consistent significant positive determinants of these perceptions. Policy implications suggest: involving likely-to-be-displaced reef fishers in the crafting of management plans; conducting intensive research on appropriate and feasible livelihood options, for example, marine culture technologies; and designing explicit strategies to increase the propensity of coastal households to invest in children's education as a strategy for long-term sustainability of resource management.","doi":"10.1080/13504509.2010.500023","journal":{"name":"of Muñoz, 3119 Nueva Ecija, Philippines; c National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO)","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":418}

This paper investigates effects of interactions, perceptions of protected areas (PAs) and sociodemographic variables on conservation attitudes, and the correlates of illegal resource extraction among 660 households from 33 villages bordering eight PAs on Sulawesi (Indonesia). Mixed-effect multiple regression analyses showed that the most important predictors of the support for PAs included the degree of involvement in management, presence/absence of PA-human conflict, perceived sustainability of forest resources and length of residency in Sulawesi. Notably, active participation in community management by transmigrants and the reconciliation of land-rights conflicts for natives may promote favourable conservation attitudes. Ordination and correlation analyses also revealed that the extent of illegal resource harvesting activities, such as hunting and logging, were significantly influenced by a negative conservation attitude and past conflict with PA establishment. Garnering support for PAs through conservation education and resolving land-rights disputes could potentially alleviate illegal resource extraction. The disparity in resource extraction patterns among the villages across all PAs confirms the importance of adopting site-specific conservation strategies that may make PAs across the biologically unique yet critically threatened Indonesian Archipelago more effective.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892909990178","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":421}

{"filename":"Lepp and Holland 2006","year":2006,"title":"Society & Natural Resources: An International Journal A Comparison of Attitudes Toward State- Led Conservation and Community-Based Conservation in the Village of Bigodi, Uganda","authors":"Lepp A. and Holland S.","dAbstract":"Attitudes Toward Conservation in the Developing World This analysis is based on extensive fieldwork conducted in Uganda, East Africa. Like many countries in the developing world, Uganda's biodiversity is at risk from a rapidly growing human population. Presently, Uganda has over 25 million people. This equates to over 100 people per square kilometer. Of these people, 90% are directly dependent on proximal natural resources for subsistence needs (Uganda Ministry of Water, Lands, and Environment 2002). With such demographics, Uganda's biodiversity is primarily conserved within a state system of protected areas. These protected areas face tremendous pressures from neighboring people. In communities neighboring protected areas, people have less access to the natural resources required for subsistence. The effect, as Uganda's president stated in a speech about the country's national parks, is ''a conflict between Uganda's expanding human population and conservation'' (Museveni 2002). In support of this, research by Mugisha (2002) shows that all of Uganda's protected areas are challenged by varying degrees of conflict with local people. This invariably creates negative attitudes toward conservation. Furthermore, Mugisha found the government's strategy of environmental education and outreach has largely failed to improve negative attitudes. Not surprisingly, Mugisha found that local people place a higher value on accessing natural resources than on conserving them. Aside from a loss of access to resources, Mugisha found that negative local attitudes were related to crop-raiding wild animals and a mistrust of park officials. Hill's (1998) research of a community neighboring Budongo Forest Reserve in Uganda revealed an interesting connection between crop raiding and conservation attitudes. While residents had positive attitudes toward elephant conservation, an integral part of conservation's local meaning was keeping elephants out of people's gardens. Naturally, when elephants destroy gardens, attitudes toward elephant conservation suffer. As in Uganda, rural people throughout the developing world generally place a high utilitarian value on natural resources (Bauer 2003; Gillingham and Lee 1999; Hill 1998; Songorwa 1999). Conserving natural resources for nonutilitarian reasons can negatively influence attitudes toward conservation. Crop raiding is also a problem across the developing world, with obvious negative impacts on conservation attitudes (Rao et al. 2002; Studsrod and Wegge 1995). De Boer and Baquete (1998) found that crop raiding by wild animals was the most significant variable influencing attitudes about Maputo Elephant Reserve in Mozambique. Predictably, crop raiding was high and attitudes were low. Interestingly, an electric fence proposed by the reserve as a solution was protested by locals, who interpreted it as a barrier to keep people out of the reserve rather than to keep animals in the reserve. This illustrates the issue of exclusion from resources, which also leads to negative attitudes toward 610 A. Lepp and S. Holland conservation (Fiallo and Jacobson 1995; Ite 1996; Jim and Xu 2002; Schwartzman et al. 2000; Weladji et al. 2003). The foregoing offers just a sampling of a large body of literature highlighting the conflicts between people dependent on proximal natural resource and the conservation of those resources. To remedy such conflicts, strategies have been promoted since the late 1980s that encourage local participation in conservation (Adams and McShane 1992; Alcorn 1993; Brandon and Wells 1992; Brown and Wyckoff-Baird 1992; Gurung 1992; Jeanrenaud 1999; Mehta and Heinen 2001; Nepal 2002). The underlying premise is that local participation will draw conservation's benefits into the community. Examples of benefits are sustainable resource extraction and tourism revenue (Lepp 2002; Studsrod and Wegge 1995). Regardless, the hope is that extending conservation's benefits will create development, improve attitudes, and foster proconservation behavior (Hulme and Murphee 2001). This is the crux of community-based conservation. Originally, this approach was accepted uncritically. This is despite the fact that little research had been conducted to identify the specific ingredients necessary for success. As a result, success has been moderate, often achieving some degree of development and improvement of attitudes but less success in encouraging proconservation behavior (Abbot and Thomas 2001; Brandon and Wells 1992; Infield and Namara 2001; Kellert et al. 2000). Wilshusen et al. (2002) argue that this limited success indicates a scarcity of knowledge, rather than a complete failure of the community-based approach.","doi":"10.1080/08941920600742377","journal":{"name":"Natural Resources: An International Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":423}

But apart from community forests, rural livelihoods also depend on forest areas, designated as 'domestic forests' in this article, where local users enjoy informal customary rights. The specific contributions of community and domestic forests to the evolution of the prevailing socio-ecological system are assessed through a diachronic study of a village which is located in southern Cameroon. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework is used to compare the progress of this social-ecological system between January 2008 and December 2009. The overall evolution of livelihoods was found to be positive during that period. In this case study, domestic forests and community forests are based on complementary models, which are often observed in southern Cameroon. Domestic forests constitute the basis of socioeconomic development, while community forests might offer opportunities for a local-level carbon sequestration payment mechanism.","doi":"10.1007/s11842-012-9199-x","journal":null,"aid":424}
{"filename":"Lewark 2011","year":2011,"title":"Study of Gender Equality in Community Based Forest Certification Programmes in Nepal","authors":"Lewark S. and George L. and Karmann M.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION The practice of community forestry in Nepal, initiated in the late 1970s was an effort to resolve the deforestation crisis and meet basic needs of forest products such as firewood, timber, grass, leaf litter etc (Hobley et al.1996, cited by Lama and Buchy 2002). This was done by handing over parts of national forests to community forest user groups (CFUGs) for its management, use, conservation and development. Forest user groups (FUGs) were also entitled to all benefits from the sale of forest products. The significance of community managed forests is its participatory approach and equal benefit sharing among the forest user groups. As stated in the policy of the operational plan, all the users should have equal rights pertaining to use of forest products, sharing of benefits, decision making. However, in Nepal, in which the structure of the society is predominantly hierarchical and patriarchal, exclusion of disadvantaged sections of people such as women, poor, and low castes are prevalent. The importance of genuine participation of minority groups to attain successful community forest management is highlighted by various researchers. (Lama and Buchy 2002). Women are known as primary users of forests and main gatherers of forest products. They play an important role in the protection of forests, though it goes unnoticed most of the times. This is because women are aware of the adverse effects of forest destruction and its negative impact on their lives (Acharya 2007). Though women play such an important role in the protection of forests, their participation and presence in decision making bodies is often seen to be insignificant (Acharya 2007). Similarly Bingeman (2003) describes that women's actively involvement in monitoring, protecting and managing village forest areas in Himachal Pradesh, India, when organized in traditional village women's organizations (mahila mandals) while on the other hand their participation is lacking in the newly introduced Joint Forestry Management (JFM) projects, due to the JFM structures dominated by men. These new structures of the JFMs though might in the long run undermine the activities of women in the mahila mandals. Agarwal (2002) states that this insignificant participation of women in turn is seen to affect institutional efficiency very often. Legal actions through amendment of laws have been taken to ensure 33% representation of women in any decision making bodies related to forests in Nepal. This recognizes the importance of women's participation at the decision making level for efficient and fair functioning of community forest management systems. Various NGOs have also been contributing to increase women's participation through awareness programmes, workshops etc. Over the years, this has resulted in a gradual increase of women's participation in decision making bodies, such as executive committees. However, it has often been observed that most women are \" listeners rather than talkers \" (Seeley 1996, cited by Agarwal 2002). An important cause for this passive participation is the lack of awareness regarding issues discussed in the meetings, which results in fewer opinions expressed. The main cause for lack of awareness is that women were not involved in the initial processes and discussions regarding community forest user group formation, due to which they fail to understand the complete situation. Just as women's active participation in any decision making body is necessary, it is equally important for them to be aware of newly introduced forest related programmes from the beginning and their active involvement throughout the entire process (Agarwal 2002). Agarwal (2009 Agarwal ( , 2010) looked into communities managing their local forests in India and Nepal, to statistically assess how the gender composition of communities affects forest management decisions and found that groups with a high proportion of women in their decision-making body (EC) show significantly greater improvements in ecological forest condition in both regions than those with less women. Nepalese groups without men in the EC have better forest regeneration and canopy growth than other groups, despite receiving much smaller and more degraded forests. Especially older women in relevant positions make substantial differences. Agarwal (2010) found that, related to interaction within the communities , groups with 25–33% women in the EC are especially effective in enhancing other women's participation. Certification of forests is a newly introduced concept in Nepal, with little information available on participation of women. Few researches exist in the field of certification, but with little focus on the role of women. In any society where gender inequalities are prevalent, new and progressive initiatives should normally include measures to reduce these inequalities. This study will also try to enquire about the extent to which this has been done in the forest certification programme and the results so far. Publications on gender and community forestry programmes are available, but they do not concentrate on certification and feedback from the people involved, so also not from women. The objective and research questions for this study are based on previously carried out research on certification, where people's perceptions about certification, which are important, were not addressed in those earlier studies. Hence, this study was taken up to look into land tenure, identify and highlight differences of men's and women's needs related to forest management, their perceptions on impacts of certification, and to understand the impact of such certification projects on the lives of men and women.","doi":"10.1505/146554811797406633","journal":{"name":"Forestry Review","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":425}

Both household coping strategies and larger-scale economic development efforts have caused severe natural resource degradation that limits future economic opportunities and endangers ecosystem services. A model based on a business infrastructure has been developed to promote and maintain sustainable agricultural and natural resource management practices, leading to direct and indirect conservation outcomes. The Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO) model operates primarily with communities surrounding national parks, strengthening conservation benefits produced by these protected areas. COMACO first identifies the least food-secure households and trains them in sustainable agricultural practices that minimize threats to natural resources while meeting household needs. In addition, COMACO identifies people responsible for severe natural resource depletion and trains them to generate alternative income sources. In an effort to maintain compliance with these practices, COMACO provides extension support and access to high-value markets that would otherwise be inaccessible to participants. Because the model is continually evolving via adaptive management, success or failure of the model as a whole is difficult to quantify at this early stage. We therefore test specific hypotheses and present data documenting the stabilization of previously declining wildlife populations; the meeting of thresholds of productivity that give COMACO access to stable, high-value markets and progress toward economic self-sufficiency; and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices by participants and other community members. Together, these findings describe a unique, business-oriented model for poverty alleviation, food production, and biodiversity conservation. conservation farming | food security | poaching | carbon | sustainability T he Luangwa Valley exhibits many characteristic linkages between poverty traps and risks to biodiversity. There is heavy reliance of households (HHs) on limited natural resources, shared vulnerability to yearly climatic variability, an absence of strong social/economic institutions, and unintended negative consequences of economic development efforts. The situation has been heading toward a new equilibrium impoverished in both human condition and biodiversity. Positive feedback stemming from trophic disruptions to wildlife populations and habitat, relatively recent shocks such as HIV/AIDS or fluctuations in cotton markets, and the continual shock of variations in rainfall all serve to hasten this change. Given the severity of these interrelated problems, a unique approach has been implemented to preserve biodiversity by focusing on improving livelihoods and food security. The Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO) model uses markets and an adaptive business approach to promote sustainable agricultural practices, rather than base development on natural resources. We begin with a brief local history and then describe the mechanisms of the COMACO model. The expected outcomes provide quantifiable metrics by which we evaluate COMACO's early progress in meeting its biodiversity, economic, and social objectives.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":426}

Currently, 90% of usable grasslands are considered \" degraded \" because of species change and productivity loss (Ministry of Agriculture 2007). Although the government has invested large sums to mitigate and control this problem, outcomes have been described as a \" partial improvement amidst overall deterioration \" (Ministry of Agriculture 2007:1). Most severely affected are the arid and semiarid provinces of Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu. Much of this area has been grazed for thousands of years as part of pastoral systems whose social institutions enabled herders to cope with the geographical and temporal unpredictability of forage production across vast areas (Fernandez-Gimenez and Le Febre 2006). Government-initiated property rights restructuring over the last 30 years has increased the vulnerability of pastoral social-ecological systems to environmental variability, including climate change. As noted by many scholars (Humphrey and Sneath 1999, Sneath 2000, Ho 2001, Williams 2002), the decline in productivity of China's grasslands and its negative impacts on herder livelihoods is inseparable from grassland property rights reform that started in the 1980s. The \" livestock contract program \" of the early 1980s was copied from farmland programs (Li et al. 2007) with the goal of preventing what was termed \" Ren Chi Da Guo Fan \" (everyone eating from the same big pot, no matter what their contribution), which was believed to be the root cause of low production efficiency because of the lack of a work incentive. The livestock contract program attempted to address the perceived \" people eating from the same pot \" problem by allocating livestock held in common as a legacy of the collective system to individual households by contract. However, although this policy solved the problem of Ren Chi Da Guo Fan, and increased livestock production dramatically, it led to grassland degradation from \" livestock eating from the same pot \" ( \" Xu Chi Da Guo Fan \" ). As a result, a new initiative, the \" grassland contracting policy \" was implemented in the middle and late 1980s (Chen 1987, Li et al. 2007). Grasslands were allocated to groups of households, known as \" hot \" in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. Hot is a Mongolian word that originally referred to a production unit of a number of mobile herder households with kinship relationships. Since the settlement policies of the collective era, it now generally refers to residential areas where a hot is several adjacent households. In the 1990s, grasslands were further allocated to individual households by contract. Underlying each initiative was the assumption that by clearly defining individual property rights, rights holders would change their behavior and invest in their enterprise and the grasslands in a way that would promote sustainable production (Taylor 2006). Unfortunately, this clarification of property rights did not cause herders to manage grasslands as was expected, so the government now sets stocking rates for pastoralists that have been on the grasslands for multiple generations. These \" balancing animals and grass \" programs are commonly resisted by herders (Li and Zhang 2009). China's grassland contracting policy, first implemented in Inner Mongolia, coincides with a global trend of privatizing land. Over the past two decades, the less developed world has experienced widespread pressure to assign parcels of land held in common to individuals (Sjaatad and Cousins 2008). The intention is to pursue efficiency and fairness through establishing market-oriented land property systems based on privately owned land (Ybarra 2008). Unfortunately, in herder economies, such fragmentation puts in jeopardy socialecological institutions that equip herders to persist despite unpredictable droughts and severe weather, institutions that could also buffer the impacts of climate change. It is widely understood that unanticipated climatic events are a typical feature of pastoralist environments. To persist and avoid destabilizing consequences, pastoralists must be able to rapidly respond to such events by accessing alternative resources (Roe et al. 1998). A lack of response can result in the destruction of the pastoralist system, while a slow response creates a lag time that will result in the loss of animals, and a subsequent delay in the ability to rebuild flocks when conditions improve. To analyze herder capacity to respond during and after the implementation of the grassland contracting policy, this study takes one \" gacha \" (village) of the Sunite Left Banner, Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia as a case study and examines how the privatization of grassland use rights has resulted in the overall deterioration of this pastoral system and the grasslands, which we call the \" tragedy of privatization. \" Theories of rights and ability to benefit (Ribot and Peluso 2003) are used to explain some of the mechanisms by which arid lands subsistence herders, and pastoral social-ecological systems, are disadvantaged and put at risk through privatization programs (Dougill et al. 2010). Further, the theory of community failure (McCay and Jentoft 1998) is applied to analyze the underlying mechanisms that weaken the ability of herders to benefit from grassland resources.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":957}

C.","dAbstract":"Study Site The survey site includes four townships located in the southern mountain area in Zhouzhi County, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, where the topography is very rough, transportation is poor, and weather conditions are unfavorable. The population is sparsely distributed with village density of 0.27/km 2 and population density of 13.66 persons/km 2 . Most villages have >10 households as a group, and villages are scattered around the smoother hillsides or at the foot of a hill. The survey site is also the watershed protection area for Xi'an city and is close to Taibai National Nature Reserve and the Provincial Zhouzhi Old County Town Nature Reserve. Some communities have collective land and forest within these nature reserves. Since the Natural Forest Conservation Program went into effect, industrial and mining activities are strictly forbidden, and poultry and livestock of the local households must be kept in enclosures. In some communities the collective forests were transferred to the state and the type of trees planted was controlled . Lumber production was banned. Implementation of these policies has restricted households' utilization of local natural resources, especially forest land and forest products. The SLCP generally uses the administrative village as the organizational unit. In 2002 at the survey site, there were 15 villages in which most households participated in the SLCP. Surveyed households possess different areas or types of farmland. In five other villages no households participated in the SLCP. Thus, we surveyed 20 villages altogether. We define the households from the 15 villages as participating or not participating in the SLCP according to whether or not they converted farmland to forest.

A. and Romã Nach S. S. and Davies-Mostert &. H. and Lindsey P. A. and Le Comber S.","dAbstract":"Legislative changes during recent decades resulted in a massive shift away from livestock towards game ranching in southern Africa, resulting in significant increases in the abundance and distribution of many wildlife species. However, there are problems associated with game ranching from a conservation perspective , including persecution of predators, overstocking, introductions of exotic species and genetic manipulation of 'huntable' species. We suggest here that most of these problems could be overcome through promoting the formation of conservancies, where adjacent ranches remove internal fencing to form larger collaborative wildlife areas. Larger areas permit the reintroduction of the full range of indigenous mammals, tending to result in a land-use shift from high-offtake, low-value consumptive utilization towards higher value forms of hunting and ecotourism. Under these land-use conditions, ranchers tend to be more tolerant of predators and often actively reintroduce them. Freedom of movement for wildlife populations increases resilience to environmental shocks. The colla-borative management agreements typical of conservancies tend to align more closely with conservation objectives than on single ranches. Fortuitously, there are financial advantages associated with conservancies: land-use options in conser-vancies are more profitable and there are economies of scale associated with cooperative management. Land within conservancies is likely to appreciate in value and attract external investment. In addition, conservancies are more conducive to developing partnerships with indigenous communities and investors and may thus increase the political and social sustainability of game ranching. However, ranchers are fiercely independent and may be resistant to removing fences due to the perception that they may relinquish control over their land and wildlife. Strategies are required to overcome such reluctance and promote the formation of conservancies to enhance the conservation value of game ranch land.","doi":"10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00529.x","journal":null,"aid":430}

Though data on impacts are scarce, indications are that bushmeat hunting is a widespread problem in savannas, with severe impacts on wildlife populations and wildlife-based land uses. The impacts of the bushmeat trade in savannas vary from edge-effects around protected areas, to disproportionate declines of some species, to severe wildlife declines in areas with inadequate anti-poachi ng. In some areas, bushmeat contribu tes significantly to food security, but these benefits are unsustainable, and hunting is wasteful, utilising a fraction of the wildlife killed or of its financial value obtainable through tourism, trophy hunting and/or legal game meat produc tion. The bushmeat trade appears to be becoming increasingly commercialised due to elev ated demand in rural areas, urban centres and even overseas cities. Other drivers for the trade include human encroachment of wildlife areas; poverty and food insecurity; and inadequate lega l framew orks to enable communities to benefit legally from wildlife, and to create incentives for people to desist from illegal bushmeat hunting. These drivers are exacerbated by inadequate wildlife laws and enforcement and in some areas, political instability.

Despite higher human population densities in rural areas, and more rapid conversion of forest to farmland, much less is known about crop raiding in Asia than in Africa. Over 14 months, we identified perceived and actual crop pests, and their patterns of crop raiding from farmland in and around Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra. Farmers named either the wild boar Sus scrofa (80%) or the pig-tailed macaque Macaca nemestrina (20%) as the two most destructive crop pests. From 5125 crop raids by 11 species of mammal, most raids were indeed made by the wild boar (56%) and the pig-tailed macaque (19%). For all species combined, temporal crop raiding peaks were positively correlated with periods of high rainfall. Spatially, most crop raids occurred nearest to the forest edge and the local guarding strategies used were ineffective. However, raids by wild boars were more extensive than raids by pig-tailed macaques, which caused much greater crop damage (73%) than wild boars (26%), contrary to farmers' perceptions. Our research suggests that alternative mitigation strategies need to be trialed over dry and rainy seasons to identify the most effective strategies and that guarding effort should be increased during the rainy seasons and tailored towards specific crop raiding species based on their unique spatial patterns.","doi":"10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00083.x","journal":null,"aid":431}

Introduction Empirically, research on social capital and community-based ecotourism (CBET) has attracted moderate, although somewhat limited, attention in the ecotourism research. Compared with mass tourism, CBET has been promoted to residents as a community activities because of its economic benefits; these could, in turn, serve as a powerful support for their pro-environmental behaviors (Bovarnick & Gupta, 2003; Lindberg, Enriquez, & Sproule, 1996; Ross & Wall, 1999; Wunder, 2000), and can potentially be reconciled with local environmental protection (Campbell, 2002; Kiss, 2004). Optimistic proponents of CBET strongly encourage a long-term view, believing that residents will actively engage with the principles of biodiversity conservation and related ecotourism attractions in order to sustain economic benefits. However, a number of authors draw the rather different conclusion that the economic benefits of ecotourism do not necessarily lead to residents supporting conservation or taking relevant action (Kiss, 2004). The increased income from ecotourism alone is often not enough for conservation (Stronza & Gordillo, 2008) or can even foster more rapid resource extraction (Barrett, Brandon, Gibson, & Gjertsen, 2001; Ferraro, 2001 ). A comprehensive analysis demonstrates that in addition to the various types of economic benefits (such as those drawn from employment, business operations, and investment in CBET), the social advantages of CBET development would also encourage local residents to act in a pro-environmental manner (Jones, 2005; Pretty & Smith, 2003; Stronza & Gordillo, 2008). Specifically, stronger relationships of trust, common rules, shared norms, reciprocity between neighbors, and endorsement of environmental behaviors within a community, or what Putnam calls \" social capital \" (Putnam, 1993, p. 36), would be instrumental factors for pro-environmental behaviors (Jones, 2005; Pretty & Smith, 2003; Stronza & Gordillo, 2008). Specifically in response to the lack of agreement on these issues, a few attempts have been made to empirically determine how the various dimensions of social capital function in generating local residents' pro-environmental behaviors from the perspective of CBET. Thus, further empirical investigation is needed to examine the role of social capital in the relationship between economic benefits and conservation (Jones, 2005; Stronza & Gordillo, 2008). The purposes of this study are therefore to: 1) integrate the theoretical perspectives of social capital into the CBET research; 2) examine whether community residents, who are the key carriers of the benefits and responsibilities of ecotourism, will undertake reciprocal actions; and, 3) investigate the role of social capital in encouraging residents' pro-environmental behaviors. The results can potentially extend our current theoretical knowledge of the relationships between ecotourism development, economic benefits, social capital, community participation, and residents' pro-environmental behaviors. Such a stronger understanding could also offer a new pathway for involving more residents in environmental protection and ecotourism development that could ultimately facilitate local natural resource management and achieve sustainable ecotourism.","doi":"10.1016/j.tourman.2013.08.016","journal":null,"aid":433}

Two of them, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain to Green Program (GTGP), are among the biggest programs in the world because of their ambitious goals, massive scales, huge payments, and potentially enormous impacts. The NFCP conserves natural forests through logging bans and afforestation with incentives to forest enterprises, whereas the GTGP converts cropland on steep slopes to forest and grassland by providing farmers with grain and cash subsidies. Overall ecological effects are beneficial, and socioeconomic effects are mostly positive. Whereas there are time lags in ecological effects, socioeconomic effects are more immediate. Both the NFCP and the GTGP also have global implications because they increase vegetative cover, enhance carbon sequestration, and reduce dust to other countries by controlling soil erosion. The future impacts of these programs may be even bigger. Extended payments for the GTGP have recently been approved by the central government for up to 8 years. The NFCP is likely to follow suit and receive renewed payments. To make these programs more effective, we recommend systematic planning, diversified funding, effective compensation, integrated research, and comprehensive monitoring. Effective implementation of these programs can also provide important experiences and lessons for other ecosystem service payment programs in China and many other parts of the world. conservation 񮽙 environment 񮽙 forests 񮽙 grassland 񮽙 sustainability","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":962}

However, simply excluding them from the area management has always inevitably resulted in conflicts. We conducted a case study of the Protected Area of Jinyun Mountain (PJM) in China to evaluate social context variables, environmental attitudes, and perceptions regarding protected area-community conflicts. Data were collected through questionnaire surveys administered to four stakeholder groups (i.e. local farmers, government staff, business persons, and tourists). A total of 112 questionnaires were completed in December 2008, after the Sichuan Earthquake. The questionnaire consisted of three parts, social context (gender, race, age, income, and education level), protected area-community conflicts, and environmental attitudes. The New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scores, which were employed to evaluate environmental attitudes, differed significantly among the stakeholder groups (P < 0.01). Specifically, government staff reported the highest and business persons did the lowest. Among the five items evaluated, anti-exemptionalism received the lowest score, while nature's balance did the highest. Evaluation of the protected area-community relationship indicated that harmony and conflict both exist in the PJM, but have different forms among different stakeholders, and seem to be opposite between government staff and local farmers. Among the indexes, tourism primarily contributed to the harmonious aspect, while collection of NTFPs did to the conflicting one. Conflict scores were positively related to age and negatively related to education level. Respondents with higher NEP scores were more partial to the park management. Besides, the respondents with higher annual incomes tended to support the policy of harmonizing the relationship and lessening the harm of local communities to the area. To promote proenvironmental attitudes and alleviate the protected area-community conflicts, we recommend improving environmental education, establishing community co-management, and launching substitute sources of cash for traditional cultivation.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.06.007","journal":null,"aid":432}

Mitigation and adaptation present two fundamentally dissimilar approaches whose differences are now well documented. Forest ecosystems play an important role in both adaptation and mitigation and there is a need to explore the linkages between these two options in order to understand their trade-offs and synergies. In forests, potential trade-offs can be observed between global ecosystem services, such as the carbon sequestration relevant for mitigation, and the local ecosystem services that are relevant for adaptation. In addition, mitigation projects can facilitate or hinder the adaptation of local people to climate change, whereas adaptation projects can affect ecosystems and their potential to sequester carbon. Linkages between adaptation and mitigation can also be observed in policies, but few climate change or forest policies have addressed these linkages in the forestry sector.

CAMPFIRE aims to help rural communities to manage their resources, especially wildlife, for their own local development. The program's central objective is to alleviate rural poverty by giving rural communities autonomy over resource management and to demonstrate to them that wildlife is not necessarily a hindrance to arable agriculture, ``but a resource that could be managed and`cultivatedand`cultivated' to provide income and food''. In this paper, we assess two important elements of CAMPFIRE: poverty alleviation and local empowerment and comment on the program's performance in achieving these highly interconnected objectives. We analyze the program's achievements in poverty alleviation by exploring tenurial patterns, resource ownership and the allocation of proceeds from resource exploitation; and its progress in local empowerment by examining its administrative and decision making structures. We conclude that the program cannot eectively achieve the goal of poverty alleviation without ®rst addressing the administrative and legal structures that underlie the country's political ecology.

Ecological resilience was estimated by the indicators: reserve areas, human density and the existence of buffer zones around the reserves. Indicators for social-resilience were grouped in two categories: flexibility (assessed by livelihood diversification and resources exploited) and capacity to organize (assessed by local/governrnenta1 demand for reserve creation, existence of fishing management rules or management plans, participation in the decision-making process and existence of self-monitoring). Amazonian reserves are larger, have buffer zones and people depend on a broader range of natural resources compared to those on the coast. However, the inhabitants of coastal reserves can rely on ecotourism and jobs outside the reserves, which may reduce local fishing pressure. Both regions have reserves created using top-down initiatives as well as those created from local demands. Yet, participation in decision making is not necessarily related to the origin of demand and the level of local involvement can be limited in either case. Unless co-management is followed by adaptive management, increased local participation of people in management and the diversification of economic sources. its benefit to resilience is limited.","doi":"10.1080/09640568.2010.508687","journal":null,"aid":964}

R. and Fischhoff I. R. and Rubenstein D. I.","dAbstract":"Setting wildlife conservation priorities and determining how to meet them is challenging, particularly when policy decisions made at large scales need to be informed by a diversity of local conditions. The persistence of species that range widely demands that they coexist with people both within and outside formally protected areas. It is often politically and financially infeasible for one central body, such as a government wildlife agency, to monitor an entire population. Therefore, conservation planners are increasingly turning to local knowledge to inform conservation decisions. Here, we show the scientific and conservation benefits of recruiting and training local community members to collect data on an endangered species, the Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi). We recruited 18 scouts from six community-held ranches in Samburu District, Kenya. The scouts record the location, group structure and habitat of all Gre-vy's zebra herds seen in walking surveys. Kernel analyses of scout herd observations indicate areas heavily used by Grevy's zebra, and the subset of these areas favored by females with young foals. The important areas identified by the scouts closely match those inferred from analyses of GPS radiocollar data. Further, scout data reveals extensive spatial and temporal overlap between livestock and Grevy's zebra. This overlap suggests the potential for competition between Grevy's zebra and domestic animals. We argue that scout programs such as ours can generate valuable insights for conservation planning. In addition, such programs have the potential to improve local attitudes toward wildlife conservation.","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2009.02.003","journal":null,"aid":437}

Approximately 25% of households depended on fishing as their main source of income, with boat owners earning average net wages of 7–68 US$/day in small-scale fisheries. Apparently unaware of restrictions on resource use, small-scale fishers reported working in 95% of the park's marine waters.

They found that the association between various indicators of environmental concern was always stronger with appreciative activities than with consumptive activities (Teisl and O'Brien 2003). In the past 30 years or so, researchers have reexamined hypotheses proposed by Dunlap and Heffernan with mixed findings (for a detailed review, see Thapa and Graefe 2003). The NEP was used in most studies as a measure for environmental attitudes. For the purpose of this study, a brief review of selected studies involving the NEP as it relates to tourism or ecotourism follows. found that demographics (except for gender) were less important than trip behavior and site-specific preferences to identify environmentally sensitive travelers when the relationship between visitors' attitudes toward the environment and their socio-demographic characteristics and trip behavior in U.S. Virgin Islands was examined. Several other studies used environmental attitudes as a basis for market segmentation, wherein the relationship between the NEP and socio-demographic characteristics of NBT or ecotourism participants was also examined (e.g., Formica and Uysal 2002; Jurowski, Uysal, and Noe 1993; Zografos and Allcroff 2007). These studies endorsed Uysal et al.'s finding that demographics were not significantly related to environmental attitudes. In addition to the weak linkage between demographic variables and the NEP in the context of tourism, previous studies also found that the relationship between the NEP and tourismrelated environmental purchasing behavior was also tenuous. For instance, Wearing et al. (2002) , in investigating the relationship among environmental attitudes, intentions, and environmentally responsible purchasing behavior with respect to international backpackers in Australia, indicated that environmental concern was not significantly related to environmental purchasing behavior. In another study, Wurzinger and Johansson (2006) found no significant differences in ecological behaviors existing between ecotourists (i.e., tourists participating in activities lasting 2 to 4 days offered by an ecotourism company) and nature tourists (i.e., tourists participating in guided day tours lasting 2 to 4 hours), despite the fact that both groups were significantly different from each other in their environmental attitudes measured by the NEP. In contrast to the weak linkages between the NEP and demographic variables and environmental purchasing behaviors , the NEP was found to be closely related to site-specific preferences and motivational factors (e.g., Khan 2004; Kim, Borges, and Chon 2006;). For example, Kim, Borges, and Chon (2006) , in examining the relationship between the NEP and visitors' motivation for attending a festival held in the city of Goias, Brazil, demonstrated that significant motivational differences existed among three environmental concern groups, low NEP group, middle NEP group, and high NEP group, in that more environmentally conscious people were more likely to attend the festival because of the program content of the festival (i.e., environment-related films and issues). This suggests that a possible relationship could exist between the level of environmental concern and the festival attraction motivation factor focusing on environmental issues.","doi":"10.1177/0047287507308331","journal":null,"aid":441}

T. and Balkwill K.","dAbstract":"In Tanzania, well-defined land tenure and resource protection apply in forest reserves which account for 30% of forested land, while the remaining 70% (mostly miombo woodlands) are village and general lands with very limited protection. The aim of this study was to determine local people's ownership rights, knowledge and institutional capacity for sustainable management of resources in forest reserves and general lands. Data were collected using participatory rural appraisal, structured and semi-structured interviews, as well as aerial photographs and landsat images. In general lands, woodlands declined by 50% between 1964 and 1996, bushlands and croplands increased by 599%, and settlements and homegardens increased by 277%. These land use and vegetation structure changes are attributed to harvesting for charcoal production and shifting cultivation. The continued decline in aerial woodland cover in the general lands suggests that common property regimes do not function in the area. Local institutional capacities are weak in enforcing control mechanisms to check the overuse of resources, which tends to approximate open access conditions. The issues of land tenure and village empowerment are not only institutional, but also political in nature. Government institutions should provide and motivate for an enabling environment, including acknowledgement of traditional knowledge, well-defined property rights and operational village by-laws. In order to ensure equity and sustainable development of natural resources, the paradigm shift in management is important whereby communal goods are to be managed for the benefit of the local society.","doi":"10.1007/s10668-003-4013-8","journal":null,"aid":442}

Most CBNRM assessments examine the underlying principles of community based conservation, the local social and ecological contexts, and connections with larger political and historical patterns. In this article, I argue that analysis of the potential and pitfalls of CBNRM also requires an understanding of the institutional history and internal dynamics of projects that implement CBNRM reforms. Drawing upon theory and methods from development ethnography and public policy, I examine the rise and fall of CONASA, a second-generation CBNRM project in Zambia that operated from 2001 to 2004. CONASA was constituted from a merger of organizations and discourses to provide continuity with previous projects. Its ambitious suite of activities included support for household livelihoods, community-based resource management, policy analysis, advocacy, and conservation enterprises at local, national, and transboundary levels. While individual activities were largely successful, CONASA's hybrid origins and logframe-centric management created fissures between its holistic design and operational logics, and hindered its ability to develop a broader narrative and maintain key alliances. This case study illustrates the importance of understanding the interplay between project design and operational context to fully appreciate the possibilities and limitations of project-mode conservation.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":443}

Assessing local people's attitudes, taking into account their needs, and respecting their opinions should become a management priority. In India, in the last 20 years, community needs and aspirations in forest management were handled through Joint Forest Management with varying degrees of success. Recently, the Forest Rights Act (2006) was passed to recognize and vest forest rights in forest dwelling communities. This major policy development is still in implementation, but little is known about how this devolution process will affect people's attitudes toward forests. In this paper, we analyze associations between attitudes toward state controlled forests (Reserved Forests) and (i) awareness about the Forest Right Act, (ii) attitudes toward the State Forest Department, and (iii) participation in forest management groups of mostly tribal forest dwellers in the district of Kodagu (Karnataka). We collected information with a structured questionnaire among 247 villagers living under three different land tenure and management regimes: (1) private coffee plantations, (2) Reserved Forest, and (3) National Park. The results of the multivariate analyses show that people are more likely to appreciate Reserved Forests if they have more knowledge about the Forest Rights Act and if they have positive attitudes toward the State Forest Department. A sobering result in our sample is that participation in formal forest management groups is negatively associated to attitudes toward Reserved Forests, suggesting the Joint Forest Management model doesn't necessarily help the transition from coercion to consent. Increasing local people awareness about their rights and improving their relations with the formal forest stewards remain priorities for sustainable forest management to emerge in India.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":446}
{"filename":"Madhusudan 2005","year":2005,"title":"The Global Village: Linkages between International Coffee Markets and Grazing by Livestock in a South Indian Wildlife Reserve","authors":"Madhusudan M. D. and Aldea L.","dAbstract":"India's heritage of natural habitats and wild species is under growing threat from its biomass-dependent rural peoples and its consumeristic urban economy. As the mainstay of its wildlife conservation effort, then, India's wildlife reserves continue to face a range of extractive uses. The Indian conserva-tion/development discourse has, however, drawn a distinction between traditional subsistence use and modern commercial use of natural resources in wildlife reserves. It has also been suggested that subsistence use must be accommodated within Indian wildlife reserves because it caters exclusively to local consumption for livelihood, whereas commercial use warrants greater restriction because it furthers profit-based goals of distant interests. How valid is such a clear distinction between subsistence use and commercial use? I address this question using the village of Hangala on the boundary of Bandipur National Park in south India as a case study. Hangala's livestock were reared primarily for their inputs of dung and draft power into local agriculture, and customarily grazed in the forests of Bandipur. This practice qualified as subsistence use because all goods and services obtained from livestock grazing in Bandipur catered exclusively to village-level consumption. In the last two decades, major upheavals in the global coffee markets dramatically boosted profit margins of coffee growers in the hill districts abutting Bandipur. The profits enabled coffee growers to afford expansions of their resource catchment for dung, an important farm manure in short supply in the coffee districts. When this demand reached Hangala, it resulted in large-scale export of dung, which transformed it from locally produced and locally consumed manure for village agriculture to a high-value organic fertilizer for commercial export to coffee plantations. Following the dung export, livestock numbers in the region increased, aggravating grazing pressures on the forests. This case study thus challenges politically correct notions that subsistence use is distinguishable from and preferable to commercial use in the context of protected-area management in India. Resumen: El patrimonio hindú de hábitats naturales y especies silvestres esta bajo la amenaza creciente de sus habitantes rurales dependientes de biomasa y de su economía urbana consumista. Por lo tanto, las reservas de vida silvestre en la India, sostén principal de sus esfuerzos de conservación de vida silvestre, continúan enfrentando una variedad de usos extractivos. Sin embargo, el discurso hindú de conservación/desarrollo ha diferenciado entre el uso tradicional de subsistencia y el uso comercial moderno de recursos naturales en las reservas de vida silvestre. También se ha sugerido que el uso de subsistencia se debe acomodar dentro de las reservas de vida silvestre porque provee sustento al consumo local exclusivamente, mientras que el uso comercial garantiza mayor restricción porque favorece metas basadas en ganancias de intereses distantes. ¿Qué tan válida es esa clara distinción ente el uso de subsistencia y el comercial? Atiendo esa pregunta utilizando como estudio de caso a la aldea de Hangala en el límite del Parque Nacional Bandipur en el sur de India. El 412 Global Markets and Subsistence Forest Use Madhusudan ganado en Hangala era criado principalmente por su producción de estiércol y fuerza de tiro en la agricultura local, y habitualmente pastaban en los bosques de Bandipur. Esta práctica calificaba como uso de subsistencia porque todos los bienes y servicios obtenidos del pastoreo del ganado en Bandipur proveían consumo a nivel de la aldea exclusivamente. En las dosúltimasdos´dosúltimas décadas, convulsiones mayores en los mercados globales de café aumentaron dramáticamente los márgenes de ganancia de cafeticultores en distritos en las colinas contiguas a Bandipur. Las ganancias permitieron que los cafeticultores expandieran su captación de estiércol, un abono importante de baja disponibilidad en distritos cafetaleros. Cuando esta demanda llegó a Hangala, resultó en una exportación de estiércol a gran escala, por lo tanto lo transformó de estiércol producido y consumido localmente como abono en la agricultura a un fertilizante orgánico de alto valor para exportación comercial a plantaciones de café. Después de la exportación de estiércol, el número de cabezas de ganado incrementó, agravando las presiones de pastoreo en los bosques. Por lo tanto, este estudio de caso desafía a las nociones políticamente correctas de que el uso de subsistencia es distinguible de y preferible a el uso comercial en el contexto de la gestión dé areas protegidas en la India.

Over the years, the utilization of the delta has shifted from communal use to state control, with an increased use for conservation and tourism. This increased use for conservation and tourism has manifested in the physical expansion of the conservation area – Moremi Game Reserve and the formation of Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) around the reserve, whose primary land use is wildlife utilization. The expansion of the conservation area has translated into several practical matters, including expansion of the area for non-hunting activities or photographic areas. The livelihoods of local communities of the Okavango delta who depended on fishing, hunter-gathering, livestock rearing, rain-fed agriculture and flood recession farming have been negatively affected by the expansion of conservation and tourism in the delta. The livelihoods alternatives in the form of Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) and tourism have not provided substitutes for the people as the communities are still reliant on the same old livelihood sources as in the past, albeit within smaller and restricted areas. This paper explores the ownership of the natural resources within the Okavango Delta. It asks and attempts to answer the following questions: Who owns and controls the use of the land? Who has access to other resources there in? Who makes the decisions on how the delta resources should be managed and used? Who benefits from the delta resources? We argue firstly that ownership of the delta as defined by legal parameters and demonstrated in natural resource management practice is vested on government. Secondly , government, after assuming ownership of the delta continues to sell its stake to the international community, at the expense of local ownership and access to resources. We conclude that in the process the ability of local communities to source a livelihood out of the delta as they previously used to, is compromised. This we argue works against the goal of sustainable development for improved livelihoods as proclaimed in government policy documents.","doi":"10.1016/j.pce.2009.07.011","journal":null,"aid":448}

It focuses on two areas of importance to the local impacts of PES and REDD+ schemes: (i) whether tenure and wealth filter access to schemes by local resource users and managers and (ii) how the design of contracts and the configuration of payments and other benefits impact local livelihoods and the sustainability of schemes. The PES schemes reviewed occurred on land falling under diverse tenure arrangements. Full ownership rights were not a prerequisite for PES agreements, but the criteria for selecting the location and participants for schemes were important access determinants. The schemes did provide some benefits to participants, generating a small amount of additional income to participating households and investments in community infrastructure and services where payments were made to community bodies. However, payments were often well below the opportunity costs faced by participants over the life of the scheme, which could diminish positive impacts on local livelihoods and ultimately undermine the sustainability of such schemes. Passing on transaction and monitoring costs from intermediaries to participants also reduced the flow of benefits to local actors. In addition, payment schedules often did not cover the full duration of the PES contract, which diminished the likely sustainability and conditionality of the schemes. Such factors will have to be clearly addressed in the design of REDD+ schemes.","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.10.009","journal":{"name":"Land Use Policy","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":450}

K. and Shackleton C. M.","dAbstract":"STUDY AREA AND CONTEXT The tropical regions of eastern India, comprising the states of Orissa, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh, are forest rich but are amongst the poorest states in India. The study area was spread over 24 villages in four districts of Orissa (17° 31񮽙񮽙E to 22° 29񮽙񮽙N) and Jharkhand (23° 45񮽙 N to 85° 30񮽙񮽙E). They are characterized by a predominantly monsoon climate, with mean annual rainfall varying from 850 mm in the north to 1,350 mm in the east, distributed across 35–45 days per year. Inter-and intra-seasonal drought is frequent, occurring every 3–4 years. Major land uses include 40% under cultivation, 30% under forest and the remaining 24% under grazing and other minor land uses (GoO, 2008 ). The region is characterized by low rates of urbanization and industrialization, and agriculture is the main source of livelihood providing employment to 75% of the working population. The high incidence of poverty in these states is deemed to be a consequence of the low agricultural productivity resulting from fragmented holdings (0.36 ha per capita compared to the national average of 1.06 ha) and low-input, single-crop, rainfed farming, with paddy rice as the primary crop (Mishra 2009). Crop failure on account of drought or pests is common (Planning Commission 2007). By Indian standards the human population density is relatively low at around 236 people km −2 . Approximately one-fifth (21%) of these are remote rural tribal communities, for whom the degree of economic deprivation is acute due to their remoteness, low formal skills and only limited links to the formal economy. The per capita annual income for Orissa and Jharkhand states averages Rs 14,000 (US$ 311) with a high poverty ratio (45%) compared to the national average of 28% (Planning Commission 2007). The 2001 census records literacy levels of approximately 49%. Due to limited employment opportunities and the relatively high abundance of forest areas, the intensity of forest use for subsistence and income generation is high compared to neighbouring states. There are approximately 29,000 villages located within 5 km of the forest edge (OFD, 2001). Three forest vegetation types (dry decid uous, moist deciduous and peninsular Sal) contribute about 80% of the total forest cover (Kishwan, 2007). The remaining 20% consists of semi-evergreen, littoral and tidal swamp forests. The states earn annual forest revenue of approximately INR 1 billion constituting a substantial non-tax revenue for the region. The majority (80%) of this comes from non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Investment in forestry development is about 1.5% of the state budget. The declining trend in timber production in Orissa and Jharkhand reflects the overall poor forest productivity of dry forests of the region. The reliance on self employment by way of sale of natural products provides important economic opportunities for many. For example, Mitchell et al. (2003) estimated that 65% of households in villages close to forests traded in at least one NTFP.Table 1). Two of these are value added products, namely Lac and Bidi. The products are mostly sold in weekly rural village markets (hat) and nearby towns, except for Sal leaf, which is stored in village centres close to the collection areas for direct transport to leaf-plate manufacturing enterprises located at cities such as Calcutta, Raipur and Ranchi (Sal leaves plucked from Shorea robusta are hand processed into 'leaf plates' and 'leaf cups' for use in small restaurants and are transported all over India from Orissa, Bengal and Jharkhand). The rolling of Bidi cigarettes (from Tendu leaf) has become a specialized enterprise in the region that requires skills and the ability to purchase raw materials, including tobacco and thread. Lac rearing is confined to villages scattered in Keonjhar and West Singbhum. Surveyed households included those in which collectors sold one or more of the six target NTFPs regularly in the weekly market (hat) or to the manufacturers' agents over the last five years, as well as households who regularly traded such NTFPs and earned at least INR 100 (US$ 3) a year. All reported incomes are sums of annual cash obtained through the sale of one or more of the six NTFPs. The products consumed within the household were not included in the income calculations. Non-farm income included earning from permanent employment and from self-generated income activities. Crop income was the sale value of all agricultural and horticultural crops. Income from off-farm employment was the value of earnings (cash and subsistence) through hiring-out of labour. Forest income was calculated earned from trade in local markets for each of the six most commonly traded NTFPs, summed per household. In order to compare the characteristics of seller households with that of the overall population of the region, data collected for a separate study by Mahapatra (2002) from randomly selected 250 households in two sample districts (Angul and Keonjhar) were taken as a socio-economic attributes of the reference population. Both quantitative (e.g. repeated semi-structured interviews ) and qualitative (participatory exercises, key informant discussions) methods were used to collect data on individual choice and household profiles. Because many respondents did not keep written records, monthly collection of data was done to limit any potential problems due to poor recall. Cash income obtained from the sale of agricultural, livestock, and forest products was computed taking the retail rate prevalent at the local market of the district. Net cash income from product sales was calculated separately for each product, but was determined on local price and deduction of direct costs incurred during harvesting, processing and sale. The costs of own labour was not considered in estimating net cash income from product sale or any other livelihood activity other than wage labour. The value of NTFP consumed in households was excluded from income estimation. Respondents were also asked the number of days and distance migrated to earn wage income. Income of members living away from home was excluded from household annual total income. Considering the social and economic heterogeneity amongst rural communities and between income regimes across products, we examined the possible influence of household characteristic on the difference in capital accumulation and livelihood diversification. A multiple stepwise regression was run between total household income and various asset and resource attributes of the household.

This study presents and discusses data that describe the contribution of NTFPs to cash income in the dry deciduous forests of Orissa and Jharkhand, India. In its focus on cash income, this study sheds light on how the sale of NTFPs and products that use NTFPs as inputs contribute to the rural economy. From analysis of a unique data set that was collected over the course of a year, the study finds that the contribution of NTFPs to cash income varies across ecological settings, seasons, income level, and caste. Such variation should inform where and when to apply NTFP forest access and management policies.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-003-8203-9","journal":null,"aid":451}

Expedition/mountaineering and tourism, as a livelihood option for the people living in the buffer zone areas of NDBR, was important, next to animal husbandry and agriculture. Until 1960, Bhotiya people in the buffer zone of NDBR and adjoining areas had a good trade relationship with Tibet. Closure of Indo-Tibetan trade due to the Indo-Chinawar of 1962, followed by imposition of conservation policies due to creation of Nanda Devi National Park in 1982 and Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in 1988, caused all consumptive uses and expedition/ mountaineering to be banned in the core zone, which has not only affected the local economy to a large extent but also created conflict between local people and reserve authorities. The ban on tourism is the most severe concern of the local people as it provided significant income. Of the three complementary functions of a biosphere reserve, viz. conservation, development and logistic support (research and education), the management is biased towards achieving conservation by legal protection which may not be sustainable in the long term. People have started raising a voice against the ban on expedition/tourism in the core zone but have not yet damaged the core zone area. This paper deals with the history of expeditions and the impact on the local economy, identification of model ecotrekking/expedition routes and potential sites, and designing appropriate strategies/action plans for sustainable ecotourism. This will not only help to resolve the local people-policy conflicts and improve the local economy but will also help to achieve the biodiversity conservation goal.","doi":"10.1080/13504500009470052","journal":{"name":"Znt.

People's perceptions were discerned through participatory discussions covering 419 households distributed in 10 villages in the buffer zone. Traditional uncodified rights of local people were substantially reduced through policy interventions set in since 1860s. Local people as well as tourists were excluded from the core zone covering an area of 625 km 2 since 1982. Deterioration of rural economy due to damage to crop and livestock by wildlife and, termination of opportunities of income from wild medicinal plant resources and tourism in the core zone were the key negative impacts of conservation policy felt by more than 90% of respondents. Mean annual economic loss per household was estimated as Rs 1285, Rs 1195 and Rs 156 due to damage caused by wildlife to food crops, fruit trees and beehives, respectively, Rs 1587 due to ban on collection of wild medicinal plants for marketing and Rs 7904 due to ban on tourism in the core zone. Reserve authority granted compensation of livestock killed by wildlife but it was hardly 5% of the market value of killed livestock as assessed by the people. People did not appreciate much the present benefits from the reserve management in the form of wages for carrying out afforestation work, partial compensation of livestock depredation and availability of solar power devices, wool, and spinning devices. Approximately 95% respondents identified empowerment of local people in respect of realising income from timber from deadrdiseased trees in community forests, income from medicinal plants in buffer zone and opening of core zone for tourism as potential development options.

B.","dAbstract":"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been hailed worldwide as vehicles toward sustainable development (SD) in coastal zones. The prominent model by which MPAs operate is through a comanagement approach, a shift from traditional top-down management. This paradigm shift must be reviewed continuously to evaluate its social and ecological impacts, thereby allowing adaptive management. We evaluated the perceived impacts of the Cogtong Bay Mangrove Rehabilitation Project (CBMRP; Philippines) by using 12 perception indicators categorized into 3 coman-agement impact criteria (equity, efficiency, and sustainability). We also collected 16 contextual attributes of each respondent to determine the correlates of perceived impacts. Our results showed that there were significant improvements in all indicators under the efficiency criterion but mixed impacts in the equity and sustainability criteria. Access to resource and household income (equity) and fisheries abundance (sustainability) were perceived to have decreased during the last 15 years and were not expected to improve in the future. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the asymmetries of the perceived impacts of the CBMRP were principally caused by disparities in perceptions by gender and by location (Candijay and Mabini). This highlighted the importance of cross-scale institutional linkages between Cogtong Bay municipalities to systematically address baywide management issues. Our results further demonstrated the necessity of integrating gender issues into the evaluation of MPA impacts to ensure a robust evaluation. Finally, we recommend that a rigorous evaluation of MPAs using a common set of impact indicators should be encouraged to allow comparison of studies both spatially and temporally.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-007-9021-2","journal":null,"aid":455}
{"filename":"Malla 1999","year":1999,"title":"Tree management and household strategies in a changing rural economy: Beyond the use of direct incentives","authors":"Malla Y.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Forestry projects often make provisions for diverse direct incentives (e.g. subsidies, grants, food for work, free inputs such as seedlings and fertilisers) as well as training and awareness raising to encourage farmers to plant trees. However, reports on the effectiveness of these measures have been mixed (Smith, 1994; Pretty and Shah, 1994; Arnold, 1995a). There is little understanding of the role of trees in farming systems and the criteria that farmers use for managing trees (Arnold, 1991; 1995a). Studies in different parts of the world have documented farmers' initiatives towards regenerating tree resources on their private farm land (Carter and Gilmour, 1989; Rusten, 1989; Chambers et al., 1989; Robinson, 1990; Gilmour and Nurse, 1991; Carter, 1992; Thapa, 1994; Arnold, 1995b; Dewees, 1995; Saxena, 1995a, 1995b; Dove, 1995; Gilmour, 1995; Jodha, 1995; Scherr, 1995; Warner, 1995). In Nepal, a whole array of developments and policy changes over a forty year period have created a more amenable environment for growing trees and supported a switch from labour intensive to labour extensive farming with important environmental side effects. This paper looks at farmers' initiatives to grow trees in a changing rural economy and draws upon a case study of a Nepali hill district, Kabhre Palanchok (Malla, 1992) -generally referred to in short as Kabhre (Figure 1). People of Kabhre district have been experiencing a process of rapid transformation from a relatively closed subsistence agriculture-based economy to one that is more open and market oriented. It provides evidence of some major changes that have taken place in the district and describes how farmers have responded to them. It then attempts to determine factors that influence farmers' decisions on tree growing, discusses policy implications and assesses the role of incentives in stimulating tree growing.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":456}

A total of 240 households were selected from twelve villages using a stratified random sampling procedure. Half of the villages represented samples closer to the park and the other half, represented samples farther away. Whether the farmer owned or rented plots on which crops were grown as well as the distance to the park from the plots were the primary factors significantly (P < 0.05) influencing crop damage by elephants in the area. Time of the elephants visiting the agricultural plots was significantly (P < 0.05) higher at night. In a ranking exercise, among seven species considered , Elephants were ranked second in importance after Warthogs for crop destruction in villages close to the park but last in villages farther away. In the latter area, the most problematic animal was the Warthog followed by the Crested Porcupine. In the former areas where elephants' damage to crops was more frequent, farmers ranked fire as the most effective way of controlling the invasion. The study concludes that bringing the community to the discussion on elephant crop damage, increasing the time of keeping vigil during the night; improving the extension services and training in awareness creation and additional research's should be undertaken to evaluate in monetary terms the value of crop damage.

This assessment is based on a research project with the following objectives: (1) analyse the biophysical and socioeconomic condition of the river as a basis for future planning; (2) identify current activities which contribute waste or pollution to the river; (3) assess the status and level of pollution in the river; (4) analyse community participation related to all stages of river management; and (5) identify future river management needs and opportunities. Due to the increasing population in Bau-Bau city, considerable new land is required for housing, roads, agriculture, social facilities, etc. Development in the city and elsewhere has increased runoff and erosion, as well as sedimentation in the river. In addition, household activities are generating more solid and domestic waste that causes organic pollution in the river. The research results show that the water quality in the upper river system is still good, whilst the quality of water in the vicinity of Bau-Bau city, from the mid-point of the watershed to the estuary, is not good, being contaminated with heavy metals (Cd and Pb) and organic pollutants. However, the levels of those pollutants are still below regulatory standards. The main reasons for pollution in the river are mainly lack of management for both liquid and solid wastes, as well as lack of community participation in river management. The government of Bau-Bau city and the community are developing a participatory approach for planning to restore and conserve the Bau-Bau River as well as the entire catchment. The activities of this project are: (1) forming institutional arrangements to support river conservation; (2) implementing extension initiatives to empower the community; (3) identifying a specific location to establish an urban forest; (4) implementing demonstration projects for liquid system management; (5) promoting coordination amongst the different organisations and agencies in the catchment; (6) improving domestic waste transportation; and (7) recycling waste to create compost material to become an income source for the community.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":970}

The overall objective of this study was to determine how to improve the utilization of forest products and rural livelihoods through CF. The analysis was carried out through a household survey, using a random sampling, along with formal and informal discussions with concerned parties. The results showed that CF was effective in improving sustainable forest resources for rural livelihoods. CF income comes from forestry and non-forestry sources, and it is invested in various activities such as community development and forest management. These activities also improve rural people's livelihood and foster social development.","doi":"10.1080/21580103.2013.801170","journal":null,"aid":458}

The lake is threatened by a variety of causes, including industrial and agricultural pollution. To support its sustainable management and conservation, the lake's recreational value is estimated using an individual travel cost model. Randomly selected visitors are interviewed during peak season about their recreational travel behavior and perception of lake conditions. Key issues in travel cost modeling are addressed, including the opportunity cost of time, group travel, substitution and income effects, and endogenous stratification and truncation due to on-site sampling. Poisson and negative binomial regression models produce similar results. We find significant over-dispersion, and therefore, use the more conservative truncated negative binomial model results to estimate consumer surplus. The value of this assessment method for resource managers is illustrated by comparing the consumer surplus with existing pricing and budgeting mechanisms. The annual flow of benefits from lake recreation appears to be almost 50 times higher than the average entrance fee paid by the predominantly higher-income segments visiting the lake, suggesting scope for increasing fees and reallocating government budgets to finance the necessary lake protection measures.","doi":"10.1080/09669582.2012.708040","journal":{"name":"Journal of Sustainable Tourism","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":459}

Therefore, a specific framework is developed here to allow an in-depth analysis of participation for the case studies presented. Two different approaches are used to distinguish participatory initiatives: First, two distinct perspectives for participatory approaches exist (Cleaver 1999; Diamond 2002): . As a means to improve the efficiency of management interventions, resulting in changes that are sustainable and approved by a larger number of people. . As an end, seen as necessary for equity and empowerment of suppressed groups. Participation is thought to facilitate social change to the advantage of marginalized groups. While these perspectives are often mixed and not easily distinguished from each other, (Cleaver 2004), it is important to bear them in mind when analyzing participatory approaches, as they can signify different goals pursued by the distinct stakeholders. Second, there are different levels of participation along a continuum (Figure 1), from simple sharing of information to transfer of power and responsibilities Borrini-Feyerabend (1996), Pretty (1997), Mattes (1998), and Diamond (2002).","doi":"10.1080/08941920701618039","journal":{"name":"Society & Natural Resources: An International Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":460}

Among EDPA strategies, WTO highlights small enterprise development, stressing government support in such development. Tourism in Kenya is foreign owned, so economic benefits leak from the local economy. It emphasizes safari/ coastal products and exploits the southern and coastal regions in an anachronistic and colonial model of tourism development. A new, postcolonial model of tourism development involving small indigenous enterprises and promoting cultural products to new markets would seem an obvious vehicle for EDPA in Kenya. Thus, Kenya's capacity to promote the development of indigenous enterprises is of interest. This study of 12 indigenously owned Kenyan tourism enterprises and six support organizations explores the challenges to tourism entrepreneurship in Kenya. The 12 enterprises fall into three categories: community-based enterprises (CBEs), and formal and informal individually owned enterprises (IOEs). Formal IOE managers had independent means and were well educated and appropriately experienced through public sector careers to deal with bureaucracy. CBEs (community initiatives offering products/services based on the natural environment) employed competent managers to address skills gaps. CBEs provide paths for skills development while raising community tourism awareness. However, community tourism development is externally driven, often by nongovernmental organizations, and can be regarded as a form of neocolo-nialism. Kenya's draft National Tourism Policy favors the development of CBEs as a way to enhance linkage. This article concludes that formalizing tourism enterprises in Kenya would require significant government investment in support mechanisms to provide sustainable tourism development opportunities for Kenyan communities.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Culture & Communication","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":461}

This qualitative study examined the political ecology of the Kapukupuku and Waya areas of the Lukanga wetlands in Zambia, designated a Ramsar site. This designation has given rise to competing 'narratives' by politicians and local community leaders over how Lukanga should be managed and used, and the resulting conflict is threatening its sustainability.

Relevant questions explored community demo-graphics, socioeconomic status, and local perceptions of the parks. The principal finding is that while a majority of people living in the peripheral zones do find conservation a valuable goal, they see it as a luxury they cannot afford. Despite their efforts and innovation, conservation and development projects have had a minimal impact on socioeconomic or associational life in the Ranomafana and Andohahela peripheral zones, and a significant but modest impact in the Masoala peripheral zone, by providing economic alternatives to destructive resource use. As a result, they are limited in their success at promoting conservation outcomes.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Human Ecology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":464}

People receiving indirect benefits from the programme expressed positive attitudes towards W. salutaris for cultural, aesthetic and ecological reasons; those receiving direct benefits cited positive impacts on their household welfare. If the reintro-duction programme for W. salutaris is to play a part in sustainable development in Tanganda Halt then inequalities in the distribution of benefits need to be addressed.

J.","dAbstract":"Considerable attention is now being given to the role and importance of education and learning implications of participatory resource and environmental governance. The contention is that such learning has the potential to transform behaviour, and in the case of resource management , may help change current patterns in resource use towards a more sustainable socialeecological system. Our purpose is to establish the opportunities for learning afforded to those participating in local level resource management committees in two Cambodian fishing communities and consider the learning outcomes from such opportunities. Our approach was qualitative and used a case study design. The findings establish a wide range of committee resource management activities that resulted in both instrumental (e.g., learning about administrative procedures) and communicative (e.g., insights into the need to conserve mangroves) learning. It was revealed that such learning can lead to changes in behaviour at the community level (e.g., managing local waste). Our findings also indicated a number of motivators and enablers of learning such as opportunities for dialogue, leadership and the presence of declining resources.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.08.012","journal":null,"aid":469}

Looking at sustainability issues through the lens of two local resource management committees , and using a triangulation of social science research methods, this paper examines the roles and responsibilities of these groups and how they grapple with resource degradation and related activities. The committees have experimented with a range of resource management strategies, from creating fishing sanctuaries to resolving fishing gear theft. The results indicate that one reason villagers are willing to engage in community-based management is when they believe that they can improve livelihoods within their community. Community-based management is being carried out in the absence of formal legislation ; it is recognized through government policy and administrative approvals. In this regard, local-level support and leadership has been key, and the current arrangement has created the political space for experimentation and learning.","doi":"10.1080/13504500509469615","journal":null,"aid":468}

We explore the proposition that resource dependency in the Egyptian Red Sea can act as a barrier to conservation. We administered face-to-face surveys to 49% of the fishing industry to: (i) identify the level of compliance to the local marine protected area (MPA), (ii) assess the level of dependency on marine resources in the region and (iii) examine the relationship between resource dependency and conservation attitudes. Only 11.4% of fishers were aware of the MPA. Fishers were mostly limited in their social flexibility and livelihood options. Results suggest that resource dependency is highly and negatively correlated with conservation attitudes suggesting that management efforts need to seriously focus on reducing dependency if conservation goals are to be met.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":470}

Exploring local and global perspectives in a payments for ecosystem services scheme in Rwanda","authors":"Martin A. and ⇑. and Gross-Camp N. and Kebede B. and Mcguire S. and Munyarukaza J.","dAbstract":"Distribution and procedure, two core social justice concepts, are central concerns for the design and practice of payments for ecosystem services (PESs). This paper explores the relationship between local conceptions of justice and the more globally referenced justice principles embedded in the design of PES schemes. The importance of this is that perceptions of justness are powerful determinants of human behaviour and, consequently, many environmental conflicts arise from contested visions of what constitutes 'just' environmental management. With that in mind we propose that PES schemes built on conceptions of justice that broadly align with those of prospective service providers will be better received than those that do not. In order to explore differences in justice conceptions, we specify three commonly defined dimensions of environmental justice: distribution, procedure and recognition. We predict that there will be differences in the importance different actors place on these different dimensions of justice and also differences in how each particular dimension is conceived. We interview 80 randomly selected respondents from a PES case in Rwanda and relate their views about justice to the design of the PES. Our findings challenge the implicit universalism in many market-based conservation interventions: that imposed framings of justice will resonate with local ones. They also challenge the assumption that different dimensions of justice are always mutually supporting – the fallacy of the rising tide that lifts all boats. We also conclude that an environmental justice framing provides a fruitful new analytical approach for research into global forest conservation efforts.","doi":"10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.02.006","journal":null,"aid":471}

Aren or sugar palm (Arenga pinnata (Wurmb) Merr.) is a multipurpose tree that provides livelihoods for local people and food for other biota in the landscape. However, its domestication is still limited in many places, such as in Batang Toru Forest Block, an area of high conservation value, including habitat for the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii). Options for aren management were prioritized as part of a landscape-scale conservation study by comparing domestication levels in the area. Data on economic indicators and ecological knowledge were gathered through interviews with key farmers, focus groups and transect walks. Four representative villages were selected for the study, that is, (i) two villages with no domestication of aren; and (ii) two villages with aren cultivation in rubber-based land-use systems. Costbenefit analyses suggested that in a rich biodiversity area, such as Batang Toru, although aren was one of the sources of local livelihoods, additional investment for domestica-tion beyond cultivation was not an option considered by farmers. Farmers still perceived wildlife as an efficient mode of aren regeneration, supported by the coexistence of people and other biota in the area. It appears the value of aren for local people's livelihoods and conservation can be enhanced by increasing its stocking density. There is also scope for improving market access and share of end-user value received by farmers.","doi":"10.1007/s10457-011-9441-0","journal":null,"aid":472}

For the evaluation-as an alternative to the comprehensive criteria and indicators on sustainable community forestry-, we propose an approach based on the core policy objectives of the program. In fact, community forestry is very much connected to the following three objectives of: 1) alleviating the poverty of forest users, 2) empowering them, and 3) improving the condition of the forests. Based on field tests in two community forests in Indonesia, the focus on the core policy objectives appears to provide a more practical approach than the use of complex criteria and indicators.

The empirical evidence for level of participation as a function of social status is obtained by using an ordered probit and two-stage least-squares model. The model also estimates the marginal effects of socioeconomic factors on different levels of participation suggesting how per unit change in such socioeconomic characters affects the level of participation. Empirical results from the model also verify that participation in forest management determines the quantity and type of benefits received from the community forest. The research findings of the study suggest that participation in community forest management is based on the socioeconomic profile of an individual and the level of participation is determined by the benefits obtained from the common forest resources. Lack of participation in community forest management excludes the disadvantaged groups from decision-making in product distribution. Consequently, the disadvantaged groups get less benefit from the community forest.

It compares the impacts on households near PFM forests (PFM zones) with those near forests with no participatory management (non-PFM zones). The study questions were: does conservation of the Arabuko-Sokoke forest result in net household incomes?; does PFM increase net household benefits?; and are household benefits uniformly distributed within the 5 km PFM intervention zone? The hypotheses tested were: forest conservation benefits exceed forest conservation costs; PFM zones have higher household benefits than non-PFM zones; and benefits and costs reduce with distance from forest edge. In the year 2009, we collected data on household benefits and costs in PFM and non-PFM zones. Data were collected along 10 km transects at 1 km intervals, sampling 600 households up to 5 km away from the forest. The results show varied household dependence on the Arabuko-Sokoke forest. The forest benefits exceed costs in PFM zones but the forest is a cost in non-PFM zones, and costs and benefits reduce with distance from forest edge. The study concludes that, though not cheap, PFM is a tool that can help the Arabuko-Sokoke forest win the support of the adjacent local communities.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Conservation and Society","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":476}

The present study, based on an empirical analysis of the Joint Forest Management program in Tamil Nadu, India, explores the variation in the perceptions of collective action among community members, and analyzes the factors influencing perceptions of its performance. The results underline the need for a shared understanding of the collective action among community members for the joint venture's success and sustainability. Further, the analysis highlights the role of costs and benefits entailed in collective action in influencing the perceptions of its performance.

Drawing on field research and guided by a sustainable rural livelihoods framework, the paper provides an overview of key institutional interventions – in particular the setting up of the Moremi Game Reserve, Wildlife Conservation Policy, Tourism Policy, Agricultural Development Policy and the erection of veterinary fences – that have served to privilege a foreign-owned and dominated commercialized wildlife and nature tourism sector and the export-oriented beef industry in the OD. The officially sanctioned barriers to customary and usufructory rights and access, and the non-recognition of historically embedded traditional land uses have decimated already marginalized resource-based subsistence livelihoods, and precipitated inter-group conflicts over preferential rights and access to resources and opportunities, notably wildlife, non-timber veld products, agriculture and community-based tourism schemes. Such outcomes, moreover, will have consequences for the longer-term sustainability of the OD both as a socioeconomic resource base and as a natural ecosystem.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9493.2008.00332.x","journal":null,"aid":481}

Results of long-term surveys and in-depth interviews indicate that the three communities have forgone traditional livelihood activities such as hunting and gathering, livestock and crop farming to participate in tourism through CBNRM. Livelihoods in these villages have been improved as a result. Basic needs such as shelter, employment and income and social services like water supply systems, transportation, scholarships and payment of funeral expenses are now provided to community members and funded with income from CBNRM.

The Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program is an example of government authorities and local communities seeking to collaborate. Blaikie (2006) calls it an established policy goal of rural development in Africa that has been promoted by most major international funding institutions since the early 1990s. Our objective here is to describe how local communities in the Okavango Delta (Figure 1) are collaborating with the government and the private sector to manage wildlife. Collaboration is a step toward effective co-management, for without basic communication and agreement on larger goals, people cannot work together to achieve conservation. We identify three factors that have served as foundations for such collaboration: (1) policies designating certain lands for local management and control; (2) the presence and strength of local institutions to manage wildlife tourism; and (3) the generation of locally significant benefits. We close with recommendations for improving these foundations of collaboration for conservation action.

E.","dAbstract":"The Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program in Botswana aims at achieving conservation and rural development. In the Okavango Delta, some communities are involved in tourism through CBNRM to improve their livelihoods. However, research has not adequately analyzed changes caused by CBNRM on traditional livelihood activities and lifestyles. This study, therefore, uses modernization theory to analyze changes on traditional livelihood activities and lifestyles caused by CBNRM at Sankoyo, Mababe and Khwai villages in the Okavango Delta. Using primary and secondary data sources, results indicate that CBNRM is causing a decline in traditional livelihood activities like subsistence hunting, gathering, crop and livestock farming. As a result, a modern cash economy has emerged. New livelihood activities done by communities include: employment in CBNRM projects, the sale of crafts to tourists and thatching grass to tourism lodges. Income derived from CBNRM affords households to build modern houses, buy foreign foods and household equipment like: four-burner gas stoves, kitchen utensils, and satellite televisions. Conversely, this causes a decline in the consumption of traditional foods and the use of huts and household utensils. CBNRM is thus a modernization tool since it is causing a transformation of traditional livelihood activities and lifestyles. However, even though changes in livelihood activities and lifestyles may be an indication of the dynamism of culture in study villages, sudden change and modernization may increase livelihood insecurity. As such, tourism planning should ensure that modernization is sensitive to traditional economic systems and the need for rural livelihood sustainability.","doi":"10.1016/j.tourman.2010.09.002","journal":null,"aid":479}

Using ethnographic field research methods supplemented by secondary data sources, results indicate that CBNRM has achieved the following: increased social capital between the CBNRM stakeholders; the formation of local conservation institutions and co-management of resources; and development of conservation practices such as suspension of hunting of declining species, selective hunting and harvesting of thatching grass in the dry season, resource monitoring and policing by communities. These practices contribute to low cases of illegal hunting in the CBNRM areas and increasing populations of giraffes and sable antelopes. Based on these findings, CBNRM can be used as a tool to achieve sustainability in natural resource use in rich biodiversity tourism destinations.","doi":"10.1080/13683500.2011.555525","journal":null,"aid":478}

In Botswana, Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) was adopted to address this challenge. CBNRM links rural development and conservation. However, the impact of CBNRM on changes of resident attitudes towards conservation and tourism is not adequately researched. This paper, therefore, assesses the impacts of CBNRM on resident attitudes towards tourism development and conservation in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The study purposively sampled villages of Khwai, Mababe and Sankoyo. Household data using variables like: economic benefits from CBNRM; level of satisfaction with CBNRM; co-management of natural resources between resident communities and government agencies; and collective action was collected. This data was supplemented by secondary and ethnographic data. Using qualitative and quantitative analysis, results indicate changes in resident attitudes from being negative to positive towards tourism and conservation. These changes are triggered by economic benefits residents derived from CBNRM, co-management in resource management; and, collective action of communities in CBNRM development. Positive attitudes towards conservation and tourism are the first building blocks towards achieving conservation in nature-based tourism destinations. As a result, decision-makers should give priority to CBNRM and use it as a tool to achieve conservation and improved livelihoods in nature-based tourism destinations of developing countries.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.03.009","journal":null,"aid":483}

Vleis are wetlands, which provide numerous resources for the communities that access and benefit from them. For a long time vleis use and sustainable management has been a topical issue amongst academics and policy makers in Zimbabwe. The following study tools were used in data collection; questionnaires, focus group discussions, trend analysis, observations, mapping and interviews. Data collected show that cultivation of Zungwi vlei started before colonisation and has continued to date. Community perceived that the state of natural resources is declining rapidly especially after 1980. Zungwi vlei was endowed with numerous resource units such as trees, swamps, springs, land, grass and reed beds. Majority (68%) of the 34 non-scheme member's interviews said they benefited from the vlei resources. The study also found that although everyone in Mazvihwa had access rights but not all those with rights to access Zungwi vlei did so. Power relations were pivotal in vlei access and use. The study identified 12 institutions, which were involved with Zungwi vlei. Customary institutions regulated access and use of resources in the vlei. Although different state agents implemented the preservative government policy on vlei utilisation and use, the study found out that they operated at a distance and were ranked lowly by peasants. Sixty percent of 76 respondents thought traditional institutions are better managers of natural resources, while 33% thought government departments should manage natural resources. Traditional institutions use customary law and mythical fences in managing natural resources. These mythical fences are threatened by modernisation. The paper concludes that traditional institutions should be empowered to be able to manage natural resources.","doi":"10.1016/j.pce.2007.07.038","journal":null,"aid":485}

Governments faced with increasing biodiversity loss as a result of human activities have resorted to the creation of protected areas as a strategy to both slow down habitat loss and/or degradation and eventually mitigate species extension and reduction rates. However, the creation of a protected area can have strong implications on the livelihoods of people inhabiting the forest and depending on it, especially those caught within its borders. The involvement of such inhabitants in the management process of the protected area can be profitable. This paper discusses the case of the Korup National Park, Cameroon, considered in the late 1980s by some to be a flagship of conservation and development efforts, and later on in the late 1990s by others as a catastrophic failure as an example of integrated conservation and development. As a means of updating the program's management information base, an in-depth participatory and socio-ecological survey was conducted by some of the program's technical staff. This study aimed at appraising the extent to which the Park's human community of 4200 inhabitants continued to relate to its resources and depend on them for their livelihood. The aim was to evaluate the potential links between the communities' livelihood and the long-term management and survival of the Park as the important biodiversity conservation zone it had been found to be. Results indicate that the successful management of a Park like Korup may well depend on the involvement of the local communities; and that successful management through approaches that minimize the potential contributions and aspirations of the local people is difficult to achieve. q","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2005.01.009","journal":null,"aid":486}

Opinions were sought about gears that sustained fish catch, gears discouraged by the government and traditional leaders, and the benefits of area management were sought. There was good agreement among most groups and traditional leaders about the gears discouraged by government, with beach seines and spear guns the most commonly listed. This indicates good agreement between government and traditions, promoted by recent government legislation, but compliance was poor since nearly two-thirds of fishers used these recently prohibited gears. This was due, in part, to lesser agreement concerning gears that promote a sustainable fishery, with spear guns and beach seines scaled low, but moderately supported in this respect by those fishers that use these gears. These gears persist because of the lack of shared evidence about the yields and sustainability of the various gears and social and economic aspects, such as increased competitiveness and decreased costs of the gears. There is evidence that beach seines lower yields but this gear persists because it is more competitive and has lower costs to the user than the other gears. Spear guns also persist because young and poor fishermen, who cannot afford costs associated with other gears, use them. Government employees scaled the benefits of area, and particularly closed area, management, higher than fishers, which is an issue of conflict but, nonetheless, has good compliance because of the long history of closed area management. For both types of management, shared perceptions alone were insufficient to achieve high compliance, and active enabling and enforcement by managers is needed.

The strongest factor was employment, with fishers having significantly less positive perceptions towards areas closed to fishing than government managers, although all groups agreed area management benefited the nation. Government personnel thought that fishers and their communities benefited from area management, while most fishers did not share this view. Increasing wealth or community participation were not significant factors, but secondary education was associated with more positive perceptions of area management. Fishers adjacent to the oldest MPA held significantly more positive perceptions than fishers living adjacent to the newest MPA, although only a slight majority agreed that they and their communities benefited. The results point to a need for patience in expecting change in resource users' perceptions, adopting an approach in which there is more communication between fishers and managers, so that both are more aware of MPA functions, particularly closed areas and the indirect benefits.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892904001791","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":494}

G. and Unruh J. D.","dAbstract":"The potential for off-farm employment (OFE) to contribute significantly to forest conservation in the tropics is a widely held logic among donors, governments, and social scientists. While an aggregate level examination of OFE cases can support this logic, there is disagreement as to the operative aspects of specific linkages and assumptions. This study examines the case of the tea industry in western Uganda, and uses a combination of fieldwork and remote sensing to pursue a more nuanced examination of the role of migration and non-monetary aspects of OFE on forest conservation in both a national park and unprotected forest contexts. Results indicate that the tea industry does serve as an off-farm employer to a limited number of local smallholders but these benefits are offset by the industry's overwhelming dependence on migrant labor which sees OFE as temporary, then seeks to settle locally. There is also evidence that the tea industry is contributing to conservation efforts of Kibale National Park by unintentionally serving as a physical buffer zone, which inhibits both human encroachment on the park and wildlife encroachment on smallholder crops. The latter represents a site-specific phenomenon that holds much potential for future management plans of the area and exemplifies the importance of considering the site-specific circumstances associated with OFE development. q","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.02.002","journal":null,"aid":1001}

Introduction The knowledge systems underlying the management of natural resources by indigenous people have been studied for many years, primarily by social scientists whose work is well-represented in the anthropological literature. In recent years, natural scientists have also looked at local or indigenous knowledge in an effort to find ways to manage natural resources with minimal environmental degradation . In certain cases, as noted by Peluso (1992) in her powerful book ''Rich Forests, Poor People: Resource Control and Resistance in Java'', local resistance to forest conservation emerged due to the ''state theft'' that criminalized customary rights over land and resources. Nonetheless, there is now increasing recognition that indigenous knowledge and systems are a key to sustainable development (Crevello, 2004) and that local environmental knowledge should be an important basis for a sustainable natural resource management in many developing countries. There are vigorous debates ongoing in the literature on the nature, role, validity and politics of indigenous people and their knowledge. Dove (2006) argues that while modernity has helped popularise indigenous knowledge and practices, it can also hamper progress and development of this indigeneity. Discussing the politics of indigeneity, the author advocates rethinking this issue and for new approaches to deal with conservation and development initiatives through better understanding of the co-evolution of science, society and environment. In the literature of local knowledge (synonymous to indigenous knowledge for the purpose of this paper), one usually finds strong advocacy for its preservation as if it were a historical artifact. However, there is growing evidence that such knowledge is far from being static (Zhihong, 2003). As local knowledge has been popularized in the modern world, this has, in some ways, also hampered its development or evolution (Dove, 2006). Zhihong (2003) notes that although local knowledge is associated with specific local environments, it is also flexible and varied, develops and evolves to suit changing conditions and situations. He argues against the dichotomy of local knowledge and modern science, considering them to be supplementary to each other and, under certain circumstances, even transferable. Sivalee (2003) provides interesting examples of how local knowledge about forest, land, and water have become integral parts of local culture and social functions in Thailand. In the same conference proceedings, Thu (2003) provides examples from Among the Dayak people in East Kalimantan, simpukng (''forest gardens'') are an important component of their traditional farming systems. Simpukng is managed secondary forests in which selected species of fruits, rattan, bamboo, timber and other plants are planted. While most are owned by families and passed down from one generation to the next, some are managed on a communal basis. Complex customary Dayak rules exist that control the use and inheritance of these forests that help to avoid over-exploitation of resources. There is clear gender division of labour among Dayak in the management of simpukng that provide a range of products – for household consumption and sale and for customary rituals – fruits, vegetables, medicines, fire wood, honey, rattan, bamboos, and timber. Local knowledge about the more highly valued species are discussed. These indigenous forest garden systems are currently under threat from large-scale mining and logging activities; conflicts between local and external agencies are unfortunately frequent. This paper examines the development and management of simpukng in four Dayak villages in East Kalimantan and their implications on sustainable management of natural resources, with particular emphasis on the role of local knowledge of some of the more highly valued species and the current challenges faced by these communities in maintaining their traditional agroforest management practices. northern Vietnam about how local rice farmers have maintained their traditional techniques while incorporating selected, tested, technologies into the traditional system. Dayak, meaning ''people of the upstream'', are the indigenous non-Malay people in Borneo (Kalimantan in Indonesia, and in Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo). These indigenous inhabitants prefer to be identified by their Dayak term with specific tribal names such as Kayan, Kenyah, Benuaq, Merab, Lun Dayeh, and Punan. The Dayak communities have been studied by many anthropologists (c.f. Lawrence et al., 1995; Dove, 2000 Dove, , 2006 Gonner, 2002; Crevello, 2004). As part of his PhD dissertation, Gonner (2002) studied the Benuaq communities in Lempunah village in East Kalimantan, focusing mainly on the local resource use and forest management and the threat posed by increasing commercial interests of the state and external investors. Traditionally, Dayak communities lived in communal longhouses (lamin) in which many families of a clan lived together under a single roof. Every longhouse had a customary chief who managed and regulated community owned resources including Bengkar or forest reserves and simpukng (forest gardens). Dayak communities have complex social structures and strata. However, in the modern era these social structures have undergone major changes due to socio-political interventions, trading and development activities. Originally Dayak Benuaq people were hunters; forest resources have always been an inseparable component of Benuaq livelihood. Most Dayak now practice swidden agriculture, traditionally involving long and complex rotations of crops and trees on various patches of land. In many Dayak communities, there is a deliberate development of fruit gardens in preference or in addition to gathering foods from the more distant, primary forest (Lawrence et al., 1995). Variations in cropping systems have long existed among different Dayak groups. Some groups such as the Kenyah historically inhabited swampy sites where they grew taro and non-irrigated rice (Sellato, 2001). The logging and mining industries have brought rapid and irreversible changes to their traditional land use systems. To date the Dayak remain active in hunting, collecting honey, wax, scented woods, nuts and bird's nests; gathering of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is still considered an important activity. The Dayak believe that natural resources, including forests, are important for human existence. That ''land and people are interdependent'' is the basic philosophy of the Dayak communities. Lati tana, or forest land, is a concept of land use management related to many aspects of human life—religion, kinship, social and economy. Communities are aware of their dependence on their natural resources and the vital need to conserve. It is well recognized that degradation of resources can lead to serious negative consequences , mostly upon succeeding generations. Simpukng is an important part of Dayak culture. Technically these are forest gardens or secondary forests enriched by planting additional species of economic value, typically fruit species, honey trees, medicinal and other useful species. Harvested products from simpukng are usually an important income source for the household. In addition to their being a source of income these forest gardens also provide food, firewood, timber and medicinal plants for household use, as well as indigenous plants of cultural and religious significance that are protected and actively managed. Reviewing examples from South-east Asia and Africa, Michon et al. (2007) report the existence and importance of ''planted forests'' that are similar to natural forests, in their vegetation structure and composition as well as economic traits and ecosystem services. The authors propose the ''domestic forest'' paradigm for the integration into forest science of a new concept of land management. In earlier papers Michon and de Foresta (1997, 1999), Michon et al. (2000) and Wiersum (2004 provide examples where agroforests represent an important stage in the 'domestication of forests'. Other authors (including Momberg, 1993; de Jong, 1994) provide examples from Kalimantan. The simpukng system in East Kalimantan is another example where the indigenous Dayak communities, through a stage of agriculture intensification, domesticate their forests. The role and functions of simpukng have been studied by other researchers (Lawrence et al., 1995; Basuki, 1999; Gonner, 2000; Sardjono, 1990) and some anecdotal information about medicinal plants in forests and simpukng in this region can be found in the gray literature. To date, Dayak people's local knowledge about medicinal plants and their management in simpukng systems has not yet been studied. The present study describes these traditional agroforest management systems utilized by the Benuaq and Bentian Dayak people in selected villages in eastern Kalimantan with a special focus on their role in the production of medicinal plants and other non-timber forest products.","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.042","journal":null,"aid":554}

J. and Sudha P. and Sangeetha G. and Murthy I. K. and Ravindranath N. H. and Indu M. and Murthy K.","dAbstract":"A decade after initiating Joint Forest Management (JFM) in India, many states have conducted evaluations of the JFM program to address weaknesses, if any, during the process of implementation and to adopt strategies to implement the program effectively. The analysis indicates that evaluation was mostly donor driven and therefore only the donor concerns were highlighted in most reports. In this paper we highlight the major issues raised by the reports reviewed. Tremendous progress has been made in terms of the number of Forest Protection Committees formed (nearly 62,900) since its inception. They cover an area of over 14 million ha. Apart from 53% open forests that can be brought under JFM, there is a lot of cultivable wasteland that could be potentially included under JFM. Though JFM has been implemented and FPC formed, their functioning is a cause for concern. Various reports indicate that the number of FPCs functioning is very low and if FPCs are to be effective, a lot of effort is needed. Lack of community participation, ineffective leadership, lack of statutory institutional support, and tenurial security are the major concerns that need to be addressed to make JFM effective. Awareness among the community about their roles and responsibilities, and capacity building is another issue that needs strengthening. A lack of proper planning, management of village resources and community involvement in the process of planning are other gaps in of the JFM program. Inadequate participation of forest dependent communities in JFM, such as landless artisans and women is a drawback in the JFM. Adequate measures to improve their participation and the means to improve their livelihood would give them a reason to help in the cause. However, the implementation of JFM has not achieved these goals to a sufficient degree. On the other hand the women's credit cooperatives started as a part of JFM, to emancipate women from financial constraints have succeeded, indicating that given the right environment JFM still could succeed. The evaluation reports have shown a huge potential for generating employment in the JFM program which in turn will reduce seasonal migration of landless labour. However, the income generating activity in JFM has not improved to the expected level, perhaps due to the poor links between produce availability and market channels. Ultimately JFM has a presence in the country and has spread throughout states at least in some pockets of India To spread the concept effectively, the Government may want to adopt a strategy that is more efficient and involves 20 K.S. Murali et al. less investment, as the external support is declining. Therefore, there is a need to undertake intensive analysis involving all stakeholders, NGOs and academics to develop an implementation strategy and create a proper environment for JFM to be implemented in a meaningful manner.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Int.

W.","dAbstract":"Originally prepared as a keynote address for the 2008 La Tapoa Workshop on Natural Resource Management (NRM) and Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM), this paper examines the Southern African experience in CBNRM over the past 20 years. From this experience the paper draws lessons on when and where CBNRM is appropriate, what can make it work, and what can make it work better. These lessons are discussed under the three categories of benefit, conservation and empowerment. Benefit is usually conceptualized in terms of financial revenue, and using a Zimbabwean case study the paper shows how in unusual circumstances this can be substantial. Normally , however, natural resource production can only supplement inputs from agriculture and other modes of production, and the paper warns against regarding CBNRM as a panacea for rural poverty. Benefit should also be understood in non-pecuniary terms, and when economic benefit is linked with authority and responsibility large increments in social capital can result. The conservation interests of donors are often perceived as being at odds with local perspectives, a perception which fails to take into consideration means-end-sequencing. A socially constructed stalemate often occurs when external agencies impose their agendas upon local populations, a stalemate which can be broken when communities are given the authority and responsibility necessary to create internally legitimate regimes. A new science which combines professional and civil inputs is required to achieve CBNRM's goal—empowered and dynamic local regimes integrated into larger scale systems of conservation and development.","doi":"10.1007/s10531-009-9644-0","journal":{"name":"Biodivers Conserv","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":557}

The ideas and practices of participatory approaches have gained acceptance in forestry: Participatory Forest Management (PFM) allows local people to participate in forest management and conservation and to contribute to their local economy and livelihoods (Oksanen et al., 2003). Wily (2002) claims that donor supported PFM pilot projects are opening the way to innovation and learning by doing. In Asia and Africa, where pilot projects have stimulated change in policy and law, the benefits have been significant (Brown et a/., 2002 and Wily, 2002). Several researchers and actors in development have recorded a dramatic increase in the formal opportunities for communities to play a responsible role in forest management: at least thirty countries in Africa have revised their forest laws (Wily 2003); in Asia, eleven national governments have revised or are in the process of revising their forest polices (Malia, 2003). Unfortunately in poor countries such as Tanzania and Mozambique PFM initiatives persist with a high level of donor dependence. While donor support clearly has a useful role to play in promoting and supporting new approaches, the critical question is what happens to PFM initiatives after the end of external funding. The title of this paper refers to Robert Chambers' ideas of \"handing over the stick\" -meaning that participation is about building partnership and ownership from the bottom up. In PFM an important question is how can the local government or local organizations take over the \"facilitation stick\" and carry out the extension work related to PFM needed for success, especially in poor counties such as Tanzania and Mozambique. Little attention has been given to the sustainability of PFM projects where \"the stick has been handed over\" and external support has withdrawn. The objectives of the present paper are to define the PFM approach and then describe the two cases in order to discuss the impacts and future opportunities for and threats to PFM. In the first case the communities are co-managers of a National Forest Reserve, whereas in the second case villages both own and manage the forest themselves. This study is not a simple assessment of the impact of PFM activities on local communities, but is an attempt to analyze the relationships between the local communities, local governments, the national government and external funding agencies.","doi":"10.1080/14728028.2006.9752553","journal":null,"aid":559}

In Tanzania the REDD+ mechanism is still under development and pilot projects are at an early stage. In this paper, we seek to understand how local priorities and needs could be met in REDD+ implementation and how these expectations match with global mitigation benefits. We examine the local priorities and needs in the use of land and forest resources in the Angai Villages Land Forest Reserve (AVLFR) in the Liwale District of Lindi Region in Tanzania. Primary data was collected in two villages, Mihumo and Lilombe, using semistructured key informant interviews and participatory rural appraisal methods. In addition, the key informant interviews were conducted with other village, district, and national level actors, as well as international donors. Findings show that in the two communities REDD+ is seen as something new and is generating new expectations among communities. However, the Angai villagers highlight three key priorities that have yet to be integrated into the design of REDD+: water scarcity, rural development, and food security. At the local level improved forest governance and sustainable management of forest resources have been identified as one way to achieve livelihood diversification. Although the national goals of REDD+ include poverty reduction, these goals are not necessarily conducive to the goals of these communities. There exist both structural and cultural limits to the ability of the Angai villages to implement these goals and to improve forestry governance. Given the vulnerability to current and future climate variability and change it will be important to consider how the AVLFR will be managed and for whose benefit?","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1004}

To increase the contribution of agroforestry, there is urgent need to test the technological robustness of agro forestry through on-farm testing with farmers as a principle step in up-scaling the adoption of the technologies. A survey of 229 households was conducted in Mubende, Kaynga and Luwero districts in the Lake Victoria Crescent (LVC) of to determine the level of awareness of the various agro forestry technologies for livelihood improvement, assess opinions of farmers about the usefulness of agroforestry technologies and evaluate their choice of planting pattern and willingness to adopt new technologies if introduced. We found that the level of awareness of agroforestry technologies was generally low with only about 30% of the farmers having been exposed to at least one improved agroforestry technology. A large proportion of farmers were willing to adopt if the technologies were introduced although several constraints such as land shortage, limited access to planning materials labour intensiveness and lack of market may limit them. The most important socioeconomic determinant is exposure to the technology. Training and sensitization are highly recommended approaches for promoting adoption of technologies that the National agricultural Advisory services should include as an integral ingredient of the advisory role.

Climate change may also exacerbate beach erosion and accretion. Natural scientists are concerned with the sustainability of species dependent on the beach ecosystem. Policymakers are preoccupied with the economic sustainability of coastal communities should species decline and prolonged beach loss occur. The aim of this paper is to explore the linkage between science and policy by reporting the findings of a study of coastal change impacts on leatherback turtle nesting and analysing the socioeconomic and adaptation implications of these changes for coastal communities. Grande Riviere, Trini-dad, was used as a case study. Primary fieldwork investigated unsustainable coastal management practices. A questionnaire was administered to examine livelihoods, including ecotourism based on leatherback turtle nesting, and knowledge and awareness of climate change. One key finding of the study was that the community's livelihoods were natural resources dependent, and that natural beach dynamics and unsustainable coastal management practices posed major threats to natural resource and economic sustainability. Another key finding was that, despite these impacts, community knowledge and awareness of climate change in general was low, and there was a perception of state responsibility for climate change adaptation. The research findings have global applicability for coastal communities at risk of exposure and that are highly vulnerable to natural resources damage arising from anthro-pogenic stress and potential climate change. These communities require policy reforms to strengthen current coastal management practices and adaptation responses aimed at ensuring long-term sustainability.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1009}

M.","dAbstract":"Most of Rwanda's wetlands are being reclaimed under government schemes with the aim of growing rice as the main crop. In the present study, information on farmers' knowledge and perceptions of agricultural wetland management was collected in Cyabayaga and Rugeramigozi wetlands. The two wetlands were selected as representatives for typical reclaimed wetland agriculture in Rwanda. They provide contrasts in both environmental and social terms. Three tools were used to investigate farmers' knowledge and perception of agricultural wetland management: (i) household survey; (ii) focus group discussions; and (iii) transect walk. The major constraints identified by farmers in the two wetlands were water shortage and lack of availability of improved seeds and high prices of fertilisers. The primary benefits from wetlands for farmers are income generation in Cyabayaga and food security in Rugeramigozi. The most commonly reported concern about the wetlands in the Cyabayaga and Rugerameragozi was that they are a source of malaria. Rice is an important crop in both wetlands, whereas farmers in Cyabahaga wish to continue cultivating rice, Rugeramigozi farmers prefer to grow rice only after it has been tested for its adaptability. Farmers have sufficient knowledge on the causes and the potential solutions to overcome most constraints. They know that soil suitability is closely related to relief. They classify soils by a number of criteria and choose crops accordingly. Any programme designed to address wetland management in the region will have to take account of farmers' knowledge and adopt a holistic view of wetland management.","doi":"10.1002/ldr.1133","journal":null,"aid":564}

In Nepal, we focus on three categories of state-initiated programs: community forestry, the parks' buffer zone program, and leasehold forestry. In the southern Indian state of Karnataka, we study the state-initiated Joint Forest Planning and Management program along with older institutions of leaf manure forests (Soppina betta) and historical sacred forests (Kans). We conclude that state-initiated approaches to involving communities have been limited, at best, promote standardized and relatively inflexible management practices, and lead to partial improvement in biodiversity and people's livelihoods. When management is initiated and owned by the community , as in the case of sacred groves in India, and when other conditions are appropriate, communities can have the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for putting effective and adaptive conservation practices in place.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-008-9073-y","journal":null,"aid":1010}

The study area, a portion of the Chitwan valley district of Nepal, represents what may be becoming a common institutional mosaic in many countries of the world who have a population reliant on forest products for their livelihood: (1) a national park; (2) a designated park buffer involving participatory forest management programs; (3) scattered patches of designated community forest; and (4) large areas of adjacent landscape made up of mostly private landholdings under agricultural practices. Utilizing Landsat images from 1989 and 2000, we analyze land cover change in each of these management zones using landscape ecology metrics and quantifying proportional distributions of land cover categories. Our results show significant differences in terms of land cover dynamics and landscape spatial pattern between these land ownership classes. These findings indicate that community-based institutions (participatory management programs in the park buffer and the designated community forests) are capable of halting or even reversing trends in deforestation and forest fragmentation.","doi":"10.1007/s10980-007-9162-y","journal":null,"aid":565}

This paper represents an effort to focus on the larger social–ecological landscapes within which protected areas are embedded, to understand why conservation succeeds and fails in different parts of the landscape. In a wildlife sanctuary in the central plains of India (Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve), we address: (i) how people living within and immediately outside a park differentially impact its resources and (ii) how the park differentially impacts communities living within. Using forest plots, satellite imagery and interviews, we evaluate park conservation by assessing plant diversity, land cover change, forest fragmentation, and attitudes of local communities towards conservation. We find that interior villages have a negative impact on regeneration, but there is a decline in tree species diversity, and increased forest cover change and fragmentation at the park periphery. Interior villages suffer greatly from crop and livestock depredations by wildlife and consider park rules to be unfairly devised. Yet, they affirm the importance of the park for conservation, and are willing to work with park authorities for stricter protection. Park authorities largely focus on resettlement of interior villages , when they should also pay attention to protecting the peripheral areas of the park from severe degradation by surrounding villages. In summary, we find that different parts of the park landscape face different conservation challenges. Taking into account spatial variations in the factors influencing conservation can greatly benefit the management of protected areas.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":566}

The conservation of biodiversity is increasingly justified by claims that human livelihoods are improved through its protection. Nature's ecosystem services do indeed benefit people, but how necessary is a diversity of living things to provide these services? Most studies cited as addressing this question in natural systems do not actually quantify relevant metrics (e.g. species richness) and assess their relationship with services and ⁄ or economic benefits. On the other hand, numerous small-scale experimental studies have demonstrated that more diverse systems do indeed tend to function better, but the relevance of these results to much larger, more complex socio-ecological systems is unclear. 2. Here, we investigate how biodiversity affects the gains from two ecosystem services, trophy hunting and ecotourism, in communal conservancies of Namibia, an arid country in southern Africa. We used statistical methods to explicitly control for confounding variables so that the effect of biodiversity per se on financial benefits to local communities was isolated. 3. Our results show that biodiversity exerts a positive effect on the economic benefits generated from these two ecosystem services produced on communal lands in Namibia. The richness of large wildlife species is positively related to income derived from ecotourism and trophy hunting after statistically controlling for potentially confounding variables such as a conservancy's geographic characteristics and human population size. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that the conservation of biodiversity can indeed generate increased services from real-world ecosystems, in this case for the benefit of impoverished rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. More such studies are needed from various ecological and socioeconomic contexts in order to boost the evidence base for positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem services.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1011}

This paper analyzes primary data on time allocation to livelihood activities by forest communities in the Indian Himalayas to investigate this question. Estimation results are consistent with the hypothesis that forest access regimes affect both forest extraction behavior and other livelihood strategies. Residents of sanctuary forests, experiencing higher restrictions on forest use, decrease the proportion of time allocated to forest extraction and livestock activities, but compensate by increasing their time allocation to agriculture in comparison to residents of state-controlled protected forests. However, wealthy residents of the wildlife sanctuary expend a higher proportion of their time in managing livestock and extracting forest resources in comparison to its less affluent residents. Thus wealth enables circumvention of access restrictions despite legalization of exclusion. Findings of this study have implications for design of biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration policies.","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.02.001","journal":null,"aid":567}

To investigate the implementation of co-management in 11 subsistence fisheries within seven rural communities in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, perceptions of the responsible authorities and the fishing communities were surveyed. Of 16 conditions often considered important for the success of co-management, only nine were correlated with perceived success, the most strongly correlated being (1) benefits of co-management must exceed costs of participation, (2) training and empowerment, and (3) existence of a long-term 'champion' to drive the process. The perceptions of the authorities concurred with those of the communities with regards to the attainment of conditions, but views on the success of co-management differed significantly owing to disagreements that were specific to three particular fisheries. Both groups agreed that co-management is a viable improvement on top-down authoritarian imposition of regulations. However, it takes time to become effective; perceived success was directly correlated with how long individual programmes had been operating. Failure to devolve power from national government to local institutions, and delays in awarding subsistence permits, remain the major stumbling blocks to full realization of co-management.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892905002195","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":568}

Even though the park is a good instrument for biodiversity conservation, ignoring the dependence of local people on park resources created conflicts between local communities and the park authority. Prohibition on the extraction of forest products from the park, and restriction on use of park roads to enter adjacent forests make the livelihoods of surrounding villagers vulnerable.

H.","dAbstract":"The potentialities of agroforestry are generally investigated through their biophysiological phenomena, cost–benefit analysis, and possible impact upon poverty reduction. There have been inadequate studies on the actual impacts of agroforestry intervention on small landholders and of farmers' attitudes toward these agroforestry programs. Drawing upon the findings of an empirical study, this article explores the effects of small-scale agroforestry on upland community development in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh. More specifically, the study clarifies the merits and demerits of different agroforestry systems as perceived by farmers, their impacts on the rural economy and the environment, farmers' attitudes toward the adoption of agroforestry, and impacts of various government policies. Field data were collected by administering questions to 90 randomly selected smallholders of the Upland Settlement Project (USP), as well as from project staff. The research tools employed were semistructured interviews, group discussions, and uncontrolled observations. The results indicated that the agroforestry interventions have in fact increased farmers' income through employment and the selling of farm products, as well as by improving the ecological conditions of these areas through reduction of soil erosion, increasing tree coverage, and maintaining soil fertility. The adoption of different agroforestry systems was governed mainly by the farmers' interests in following these techniques, their ability to cultivate the land in the prescribed manner, and the market demand for their products. The major obstacles that prevented increased agroforestry improvements included lack of confidence in new land-use systems, inappropriate project design (e.g., top-down innovation approach), and policy issues regarding land tenure. Recommendations are proposed to strengthen social capital in local organizations to enhance the livelihoods of the upland communities.","doi":"10.1007/s10310-005-0171-x","journal":null,"aid":1013}
{"filename":"Nath Inoue 2009b","year":2009,"title":"Forest-Based Settlement Project and Its Impacts on Community Livelihood in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh","authors":"Nath T. K. and Inoue M.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), which comprises of Bandarban, Rangamati, and Khagrachari hill districts, cover 10% of the country's total land area and represent nearly 50% of the total national forest area (FMP 1992). The CHT are inhabited by 11 ethnic communities, which draw their livelihood from hill forest resources. More than 90% of the region's people depend upon subsistence agriculture, and the majority is involved in shifting cultivation (jhum) (Nath et al. 2005a). Construction of Kaptai hydroelectric dam in 1960 submerged 40% of the region's productive arable land, caused heavy environmental, socioeconomic, and ecological damage, and displaced about 100 000 ethnic people (van Schendel et al. 2001). Tens of thousands of those who were displaced could not find a new niche in the CHT and had to seek refuge in India and Myanmar (van Schendel et al. 2001). Side by side, government policies on the expansion of forest reserves that declared almost all of the CHT as 'Government Forest,' state-sponsored forest exploitation (van Schendel et al. 2001), and indiscriminate illegal logging have restricted the area for jhum, which forced farmers to change the fallow period from the previous 15 to 20 years, to the current 2 to 3 years. Although for centuries jhum worked effectively and people were self-sufficient in food (Haque 2000), nowadays jhumias (shifting cultivators) face a food shortage two to six months in a year (Nath at al. 2005b). In order to resettle the displaced jhumias and to improve their livelihood, the government undertook a number of settlement projects in the CHT (Table 1). Most of these projects failed to live up to stated goals and expectations. The lack of success in previous projects was partly due to the lack of experience and expertise on the part of officials, misappropriation of funds by corrupt officials, and a lack of experience among farmers themselves, who were not used to planting and tending fruit trees on a commercial scale (AITPN 2000; Roy 2002). Other reasons were bad road networks that created marketing problems and the lack of credit and storage facilities (ibid.). Based on lessons learned from the previous projects, the government of Bangladesh undertook a participatory forestry (PF) project known as the Upland Settlement Project (USP) in the early 1980s in degraded forest areas of the CHT (CHTDB 2001). The USP has rehabilitated landless jhumias, through a number of agroforestry and social development functions including capacity-building and infrastructure development (Khan et al. 2003). The Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board (CHTDB), a premier government agency that conducts most CHT development projects, had implemented the USP in two phases. The ADB funded the first USP phase, running from 1985 to 1993, by settling 2000 ethnic families (hereafter participants), and establishing 1620 ha of homestead agroforestry and 3240 ha of rubber plantations in 39 project villages in the Khagrachari district. Considering the success of the first phase, the second phase of the USP was formulated with the following objectives (CHTDB 2001, Khisa and Hossain 2002): 񮽙񮽙 Settlement of landless jhumias in suitable areas in Khagrachari and Bandarban districts, 񮽙񮽙 Development of suitable upland areas, which are currently unused or used for jhum, for diversified cropping with horticulture, agroforestry, and rubber plantations, and 񮽙񮽙 Long-term socioeconomic development of target groups The specific objective of the et al. (2003) reported the land use patterns and poverty impacts of PF on upland ethnic communities. They found that after joining the PF projects, beneficiaries were motivated to initiate agroforestry practices and to give up jhum, whereupon their household income level increased. An evaluation report on the forestry sector project concluded that project beneficiaries, including ethnic people in the CHT, seemed to have increased their average annual savings, and raised their accumulated assets and social status thanks to joining in the forestry projects. Additionally, tree cover had increased in project areas (ADB 2005). Hossain (1998) mentioned that due to the nomadic nature of ethnic people and to ignorance of their culture and religious values by the project authority, most of the jhumia rehabilitation projects were unsustainable. Although these studies reported, through focus group discussions, ethnography, and informal interviews, some aspects of PF project livelihood impacts in CHT communities, the authors did not follow any livelihood framework in examining participants' livelihoods. There were insufficient data to fully understand the project's impacts on community livelihood. The present study was a comprehensive livelihood analyses based on a sustainable livelihood (SL) framework and examined five types of livelihood capitals — namely human, physical, natural, financial, and social capital — of the participants, as well as the factors that underlay success or failure of the settlement project in achieving targeted project's objectives and livelihood diversification strategies.

Systematic monitoring of crop loss to wildlife (mammals larger than 3 kg) and livestock was conducted in six villages around Kibale over a 2-year period. Five wildlife species accounted for 85% of crop damage events: baboons, bushpigs, redtail monkeys, chimpanzees, and elephants. Marked variation in frequency and extent of damage is reported within villages, between villages, and between wildlife species. Fields lying within 500 m of the forest boundary lost 4–7% of crops per season on average, but the distribution of damage was highly skewed such that maize and cassava fields were on occasion completely destroyed. Multivariate analysis was used to test predictors of damage, including human population density, guarding, hunting, sight distance, and distance from the forest. Tests were performed at two levels of analysis, field and village. Distance from the forest edge explained the greatest amount of variation in crop damage, although hunting also influenced the extent of crop damage. Elephants inflicted catastrophic damage to farms but their forays were rare and highly localized. Livestock caused considerable damage to crops but farmers seldom complained because they had institutionalized modes of restitution. Although most of the crop damage by wildlife is restricted to a narrow band of farmers living near the forest edge, risk perception among these farmers has been amplified by legal prohibitions on killing wild animals. Elevating local tolerance for wildlife will require diverse approaches, including channeling economic benefits to Kibale's neighbors and providing compensation in limited cases.

Particularly in developing countries the sustainable livelihood of the local perople is difficult if restrictions are imposed on their traditional usufruct rights over the natural resources. Based on the extensive field work and analysis of satellite imagery in the selected localities of the Indian Himalaya, we found that if the people are having the alternate avenue (profitable options) for earning, their dependencies on the existing resources (only to meet the subsistence needs, not for commercial purpose) will become much lower.

The transhumant pastoralist societies inhabiting the high Indian Himalaya exploit the seasonal abundance of grazing resources. The Tolchha subcommunity of Bhotiyas (an Indomongoloid ethnic group), who inhabit the settlements forming the buffer zone villages of the Chamoli part of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) (Fig- ure 1 ), are undergoing rapid assimilation into the sedentary population (Khasa ethnic group, Garhwali population ). Although such changes are also reported for other transhumant communities in the region (Shashi 1979; Brower 1991; Farooquee and Nautiyal 1996; Farooquee 1998; Saberwal 1999) and elsewhere (Meir 1987; Casimir 1991; Kuznar 1991; Cincotta et al 1992), the impact of changing land-use policies on livestock populations and the transhumant way of life has not been fully assessed. Nomadic pastoralism and transhumance are based on efficient use of seasonally abundant resources in marginal environments without degradation. They thus require the support of local policies to continue within carrying-capacity limits. The present article examines the impact of conservation policies on livestock husbandry , population fluctuations over a period of 3 decades, and changes in ownership structures in a representative high-altitude village with transhumant pastoralist households (Dronagiri) and a representative low-altitude village where households are undergoing rapid sedentarization (Lata), in the Chamoli part of the buffer zone of the NDBR.

The forests of the Congo Basin are exploited by rural communities and timber companies at different scales to meet various conflicting interests. The forest contributes in several ways to rural livelihoods, but the growing importance of timber exploitation poses a threat to this livelihood's fabric and to the conservation of biodiversity.

Schwarzmeier. 2003. Access to natural resources in Mainland Southeast Asia and implications for sustaining rural livelihoods – The case of Thailand. Quarterly Journal of International Agriculture 42 (3) Summary Drawing on various case studies, this article presents evidence of the failure of the state paradigm in the management of natural resources, such as forests and agricultural land in protected areas, and discusses the ambiguous achievements of the land reform process in the most poverty-stricken regions of North and Northeast Thailand. Results suggest that local communities and ethnic minorities have reacted to top-down planning, corruptive land allocation and repressive forest policies by initiating their own reforestation activities – often supported by NGOs – with local management and control structures, by initiating resource protection measures, such as planting of fruit trees, and by reviving religious traditions of sacred forests. Thus, rural communities try to demonstrate that the conventional paradigm of the Royal Forest Department of \" forest without people \" is alien to their local concepts of natural resource management. Recently, desperate attempts of reclaiming rural people's lands from speculators in North Thailand have resulted in massive public pressure forcing the government to reconsider its resource policies. While some promising attempts of decentralisation of natural resource management have been initiated, the nature of these policies remains highly controversial and ambiguous. The authors conclude that the reluctance of government agencies to devolve control over natural resources to local communities seriously jeopardise their strive for food security and sustainable livelihoods.

S. and Leposo A. and Loure E. and Peterson D. and Peterson M. and Peterson T. and Sachedina H. and Williams A.","dAbstract":"Payments for ecosystem services (PES) are an increasingly promoted approach to conservation. These approaches seek to develop financial mechanisms that create economic incentives for the maintenance of ecosystems and associated biodiversity by rewarding those who are responsible for provision of ecological services. There are, however, few cases in which such schemes have been used as a strategy for conserving wildlife in developing countries and very few operational examples of such schemes of any sort in sub-Saharan Africa. In savannah ecosystems, large mammal populations generally depend on seasonal use of extensive areas and are widely declining as a result of habitat loss, overexploitation, and policies that limit local benefits from wildlife. Community-based conservation strategies seek to create local incentives for conserving wildlife, but often have limited impact as a result of persistent institutional barriers that limit local rights and economic benefits. In northern Tanzania, a consortium of tourism operators is attempting to address these challenges through an agreement with a village that possesses part of a key wildlife dispersal area outside Tarangire National Park. The operators pay the community to enforce voluntary restrictions on agricultural cultivation and permanent settlement in a defined area of land. The initiative represents a potentially cost-effective framework for community-based conservation in an ecologically important area and is helping to reconcile historically conflicting local and national interests relative to land tenure, pastoralist livelihoods, and conservation. Wider adaptation of payments for ecosystem services approaches to settings where sustaining wildlife populations depends on local stewardship may help address current challenges facing conservation outside state-protected areas in savannah ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world. Pago de los Servicios Ecosistémicos como Marco de Referencia para la Conservación Basada en Comunidades en el Norte de Tanzania Resumen: Los pagos de servicios ecosistémicos son un enfoque cada vez más promovido para la conser-vación.

A survey of 189 households conducted between October and December 2004 examined local residents' perceived benefits, their attitudes toward park management, and perception of linkages between conservation and livelihoods. Linkage perceptions were measured by a scale compared with a respondent's recognition of benefits to determine whether IBPs establish a connection between benefits and livelihoods. An attitude scale was also created to compare attitudes toward park management with perceptions of benefits and linkage to determine if IBPs led to positive attitudes, and if the recognition of a direct tie between livelihoods and natural resources made attitudes more favorable. Research results indicate that as acknowledgement of benefit increases, so does the perception of linkage between the resource and livelihoods. Similarly, when perceived benefit increases, so too does attitude towards management. Positive attitude towards park management is influenced more by perception of livelihood dependence on resources than on benefits received from the park. However, overwhelming positive support voiced for conservation did not coincide with conduct. In spite of the positive attitudes and high perception of linkage, people did not necessarily behave in a way compatible with conservation. This suggests that while benefits alone can lead to positive attitudes, without clear linkages to conservation, the IBP may lose persuasion when alternative options—conflicting with conservation objectives—arise promising to provide greater economic benefit.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-011-9631-6","journal":null,"aid":580}

E.","dAbstract":"/ This paper analyzes five major causes of park-people conflicts that have occurred in Nepal's Royal Chitwan National Park. The causes include illlegal transactions of forest products from the park, livestock grazing in the park, illegal hunting and fishing, crop damage, and threats to human and animat life caused by wild animals from the park. The conflicts indicate a reciprocal relationship between the park and local people. They reflect the attitudes of local people and representatives of the park authority whose priorities and objectives largely diverge. The results show that people settled adjacent to the park are heavily dependent on its resources. Even in places where some, albeit few alternative sources exist, local people continue to trespass the park boundary as these sources are inadequate to ensure the fulfillment of local people's resource needs. Illegal transactions of resources continue throughout the year; however, they are less intense during summer due to flooding caused by the Rapti River, which forms the park boundary towards the northern section where this study is conducted. The frequency of local people's visits to the park is mainly determined by their age, distance between homesteads and park, and volume of crop loss caused by wild animals. Crop damage is the function of size of landholding, distance, and frequency of crop raid. Local people claim that they have no intention of letting their livestock graze in the park; however, the dense vegetation of the park attracts livestock grazing on riverbanks just outside the open park boundary. Many head of livestock are killed by carnivores of the park. Human casualties are mainly caused by sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), tiger (Panthera tigris), wild pig (Sug scrofa), and rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). There had been some earlier attempts to reconcile the conflicts by offering local people different kinds of compensations; however, these were unsuccessful measures. An integrated approach is essential if efforts to resolve the park-people conflicts are to succeed. The government is in the process of launching a project that aims to resolve the inherent problems with such an approach. Suggestions are made to incorporate some key elements, such as maintaining effective communication between various parties and the potential for wildlife conservation among local people. Parks and protected areas in the developing countries , particularly in Asia, were established beginning in the second quarter of this century (Mishra, 1991). The earlier establishments were largely derived from the North American model, which envisioned parks as representatives of \"the vignette of primitive America,\" laying emphasis on setting aside certain special places to protect them from the ravages of ordinary use (Hales 1989). This concept is ill suited to the needs of the developing countries where the socioeconomic and political conditions are very different.

This has raised concern over sustainability of the hill farming system. There is growing evidence that agroforestry can be a potential solution to above problems. However, the development of agroforestry as a viable alternative for farmers in diverse ecological and socioeconomic conditions has become a very challenging issue. The objective of this paper was to identify factors influencing the adoption of agroforestry by subsistence farmers in the hills, with reference to an agroforestry project initiated by Nepal Agroforestry Foundation (NAF). Necessary information for this study came from a survey of 223 households (82 project and 141 non-project) from Kumpur, Nalang, and Salang villages in Dhading district in 1998. The results showed that male membership in local NGOs, female education level, livestock population, and farmer's positive perception towards agroforestry have significantly positive effects, while the number of children below 5 years of age, number of males aged 10–59 years, male education, female's Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) membership, and respondents' age had significantly negative effects on adoption of agroforestry among project households. Among non-project households, those with more livestock and male membership to local NGOs were found more likely to adopt, while the households headed by males were less likely to adopt agroforestry. #","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Agricultural Systems","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":582}

S. and Endo W. and Peres C. A.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction Tropical forest biomes harbour the highest levels of terrestrial biodiversity on Earth, provide key environmental services, and support the livelihoods of millions of rural people (Chhatre and Agrawal, 2009). However, tropical forest loss continues—driven by a multitude of factors including human-induced land-use change and forest degradation (Rudel et al., 2009). In the last two decades, emissions from tropical deforestation have contributed 15–23% of the annual global carbon emissions, particularly if subsequent land-use is considered (van der Werf et al., 2009). To stem future losses of forest cover, government and non-governmental agencies are increasingly embracing the implementation of payments for environmental services (PES) programmes (Farley and Costanza, 2010). Environmental services (ES) are aspects of ecosystems used to produce human wellbeing, either actively or passively (Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007; Fisher et al., 2009). PES programmes provide a variety of mechanisms by which the values of these services can be converted into financial incentives for conservation (Shelley, 2011). As economic decision-making often fails to fully account for environmental service provision (Liu et al., 2010), direct or market-based incentives such as PES seek to transfer funds from those that benefit from environmental services to those that contribute to their production or conservation by inducing benign land-use practices (Wunder, 2005; Sommerville et al., 2009; Shelley, 2011). PES have been defined as ''(1) a voluntary transaction where (2) a well-defined ES (or corresponding land use) is (3) being 'bought' by a (minimum one) ES buyer (4) from a (minimum one) ES provider (5) if and only if ES provision is secured (conditionality)'' (Wunder, 2005, p. 3). Recently, attempts to Global Environmental Change 22 (2012) 127–136 A R T I C L E I N F O Article history: A B S T R A C T Primary tropical forests provide crucial environmental services, including carbon storage and hydrological regulation. Options for promoting forest conservation include payments for environmental services (PES) programmes that provide financial incentives to local actors, in exchange for reduced forest clearance. The success of voluntary PES (defined in terms of avoided primary forest conversion) is contingent upon behavioural changes in enrolled actors. As both the degree of enrolment and likelihood of sustained behavioural change depend upon how PES compensation structures interact with existing actor economies, local heterogeneity in livelihood strategies may play a strong role in the ultimate success of PES programmes, particularly when compensation is not differentiated with respect to opportunity costs. We examined the influence of livelihood heterogeneity on the potential success of a deforestation-reduction PES with an undifferentiated reward structure. We collected socioeconomic and demographic data at the household and community levels across two large Amazonian extractive reserves where a spatially extensive PES programme (Bolsa Floresta) operates. We show that demographic and socioeconomic status varies widely across households and communities, and found that both households and communities that are most and least likely to convert primary forest receive similar financial incentives. Those households most engaged in manioc agriculture (the primary driver of local primary forest conversion) both benefitted from the highest annual incomes and incurred the greatest opportunity costs. We show that avoided primary forest conversion could be greatly increased with differentiated payment structures adjusted for local differences in opportunity costs and livelihood strategies, and present two metrics that could help to achieve that goal. ß 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. describe PES programmes in practice have embraced more pragmatic definitions of ''PES-like'' initiatives that are broadly compliant with the concept of reward or compensation for altered land management practices (Muradian et al., 2010), even if they fail to meet one or more of the criteria above (e.g. strictly voluntary participation, e.g. Vatn, 2010). There is a growing demand to understand the extent to which PES programmes contribute to concrete environmental gains (Redford and Adams, 2009;). The overall success of any given PES programme can be measured in terms of enrolment, conditionality, additionality, permanence, and leakage (Engel et al., 2008). Firstly, potential service providers must be voluntarily attracted to enrol in the programme, and to remain enrolled over time to secure long-term gains in ES provision. Secondly, the granting of compensation must be conditional on compliance with ES provision. This requires not only adequate compensation for enrolled providers but also a monitoring system and penalty structures that can influence continued production and continued voluntary enrolment (Meijerink, 2008). Thirdly, enrolment and compliance must jointly produce additionality; a change in land-use (and therefore ES provision) beyond what would have happened in the absence of the programme (Engel et al., 2008). Finally, whether additionality can be expected to persist over time (permanence) and whether gains in additionality come at the cost of displacing ecologically perverse land-use practices to areas outside the project boundaries (leakage) are important additional metrics of success for any PES programme. Fundamental to enrolment, compliance, and ensuing additionality is the underlying payment structure of a PES programme (). Many programmes compensate enrolled participants according to the opportunity cost incurred during the transition to a PES-compliant land use. To estimate appropriate payment amounts, PES programmes use various metrics to assess the degree of behavioural change entailed or the relative value of the land involved. Programmes with such differentiated payments are more often seen in user-financed (rather than governmentsponsored ) programmes implemented across small spatial scales (). Examples of PES structures involving some degree of differentiation include the Pago de Servicios Ambientales Hidrológicos (PSAH) in Mexico (Muñ Piñ a et al., 2008), the Vittel watershed protection programme in France (Perrot-MaıˆtreMaıˆtre, 2006), and the Pimampiro programme in Ecuador (Wunder and Albá n, 2008). The degree of refinement of differentiated payment schemes varies greatly; from broad categories of land type (e.g. the PSAH pays a higher rate to landowners protecting cloud forest), to custom pricing for individual plots within landholdings (e.g. the Vittel PES). In contrast, other programmes uniformly distribute benefits across all enrolled ES providers, regardless of variance in individual opportunity costs (i.e. undifferentiated payments). Such programmes include many government-financed schemes and pay undifferentiated rates per unit land area. This flat-rate reward structure is often necessary as a consequence of vast spatial extents, equity concerns or intractable transaction costs. Examples of undifferentiated payments programmes include Socio Bosque in Ecuador (de Koning et al., 2011) and Los Negros in Bolivia (Asquith et al., 2008). Finally, some PES programmes have payments that are neither differentiated by opportunity cost nor by the extent of land area committed, including the Simanjiro PES agreement in Tanzania (Nelson et al., 2010) and Bolsa Floresta in Brazil (Viana, 2008). Although the development and poverty alleviation goals of PES programmes are usually considered secondary to their environmental aims (Engel et al., 2008), PES are often implemented in poor areas, where perceived or actual financial, development or social benefits may influence both the initial commitment and subsequent adherence to programme requirements by individual actors (Kosoy et al., 2008; Vatn, 2010). Given that payments in PES programmes are often targeted at both the actor (households) and community levels, an understanding of local economic or livelihood factors that influence enrolment or compliance at both levels of organisation will have strong implications for ultimate programme success (Wunder, 2007). However, few data are available to explicitly link local livelihood strategies to the effect size of alternative PES payment structures. The rural livelihood strategies of individual households and communities within legally occupied Amazonian reserves (hereafter , extractive reserves) tend to be very heterogeneous, with variable engagement with agricultural and extractive activities and consequential reliance on different forest types (Takasaki et al., 2001; Long, 2010). Households show strong congruence in livelihood strategy within any given community, but accessibility to alternative forest types results in strong inter-community variation in both livelihood strategy and the degree to which local economies rely upon forest conversion into agricultural land (Newton et al., in press). Households and communities enrolled in a PES programme designed to avoid small-scale deforestation will therefore incur variable opportunity costs, depending on the extent to which their behaviour must change in order to ensure PES compliance. Here we consider how local heterogeneity in economic or livelihood factors affects the effectiveness of undifferentiated payment structures in a PES programme designed to reduce rates of primary forest conversion. As a case study, we examined the Bolsa Floresta (Forest Conservation Allowance), an extensive PES programme established across extractive reserves within Amazonas , the largest Brazilian state. Bolsa Floresta (BF) began in 2007 and provides compensation to traditional populations for ES flowing from primary forest retention, in the form of cash payments and developmental support. The BF programme explicitly suppresses clearance of primary forest areas, limiting agricultural expansion to the extent of previously available swidden fields (roçados) and secondary forest (capoeira). With 7971 households enrolled across 15 reserves to date, and an ambitious projected expansion into other reserves, BF represents one of the largest-scale PES programmes implemented in a tropical forest region (FAS, 2011a). Like many PES in developing countries, BF is a hybrid programme, mixing government and user financing (via international agencies, private investors and NGOs) with local, NGO-based administration. Heterogeneity in the livelihood strategies of actors voluntarily enrolled in PES programmes with undifferentiated payment structures may result in reduced social and environmental benefit, when payments do not adequately exceed opportunity costs, or are inefficiently spent on areas with low expected additionality. Within agricultural communities, the opportunity costs of prohibited primary forest conversion depend heavily on the availability of existing swidden fields (roçados) and secondaryforest patches (capoeiras). For example, compared to newly established communities, older communities may have a greater pool of surrounding secondary-forest to draw upon as a result of previous cycles of swidden/fallow agriculture. Conversely, the largest communities may have saturated all of the forest (primary and secondary) within a viable travel distance. Each of these scenarios would lessen the likelihood of primary forest clearance in the absence of PES payments, with a lower associated opportunity cost of foregone primary forest conversion. We assessed the potential scope of BF payments based on pre- PES livelihoods and incomes, using data obtained across two large extractive reserves in western Brazilian Amazonia. We explored the relative economic impact of BF compliance on recipients' incomes, and discuss the likelihood of the programme achieving its goals.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":583}

Managers of extractive reserves need to understand the livelihood strategies adopted by rural Amazonians in order to implement projects that benefit the livelihoods of local residents whilst maintaining forest integrity. Whilst resident populations are often descended from immigrant rubber-tappers, dynamic economic and social conditions have led to a recent diversification of land-use practices. This two-year study in two large contiguous extractive reserves encompassing both unflooded (terra firme) and seasonally flooded (várzea) forest, shows the degree to which local livelihood strategies of different settlements are heterogeneous. Extractive offtake of forest products and fish catches and agricultural activities, together with income from sales, for 82 households in 10 communities were quantified in detail by means of weekly surveys. The survey data were combined with interviews to examine the demographic and wealth profile, and engagement in alternative activities, in 181 households across 27 communities. All households and communities were engaged in all three subsistence activity types, but there was large variation in engagement with income-generating activities. Households within a community showed considerable congruence in their income-generating activity profiles, but there was significant variation between communities. Yields from agriculture and fishing were more temporally stable than extraction of highly-seasonal forest products. Generalized linear mixed models showed that forest type was consistently important in explaining yields of both agrarian and extractive products. Communities with greater access to terra firme forest were inherently more agricultural, and strongly committed to manioc production. Communities with greater access to flooded forest, however, showed a greater dependence on fishing.

{"filename":"Novellino and Dressler 2010","year":2010,"title":"Society & Natural Resources: An International Journal The Role of \" Hybrid \" NGOs in the Conservation and Development of Palawan Island, The Philippines","authors":"Novellino D. and Dressler W. H.","dAbstract":"The Post-Marcos Rise of ''Hybrid'' NGOs on Palawan Island After years of martial law under Marcos, the 1983 murder of Ninoy Aquiño— Marcos's best-known political opponent—set off a wave of social protest culminating in the ''People Power Revolution'' that instated Cory Aquino as President in 1986. These years were characterized by democratic revival leading to the proliferation of diverse NGOs and people's organizations (POs) (Clarke 1998; Eaton 2003). Cory Aquino initially embraced NGOs in political process, assigned human rights lawyers and NGO leaders to government, and with constitutional amendments in 1987, supported the devolution of authority to the subnational level. Tripartite relations between the state, NGOs, and POs soon ran under the Local Government Code (LGC 1992) (Bryant 2005). Pressuring the state to remain a democratic constituency, diverse NGO coalitions soon tapped new Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) policies and the LGC to tackle environment and development ''holistically'' through, for example, facilitating ancestral title and community-based conservation among indigenous uplanders (Dressler et al. 2006; 2009) . Some considered this political outcome as a radical restructuring of the development discourse of the time—a new humanistic, populist consensus had emerged (Brilliantes 1994; Eaton 2003). However, while NGOs were no longer considered a threat to state bureaucracy, new tensions arose as NGO–state relations ebbed and flowed through the presidencies of Ramos, Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. As NGOs tackled the rise in deforestation and poverty, many saw state–civil society relations return to their pre-Aquino status of the traditional elite controlling political process and structure. This engendered what Bryant (2001) has called ''critical engagements'': While NGOs would cooperate, they also reserved the right to disagree with issues that state agencies mishandled. International funders soon supported diverse NGO interventions in socioeconomic development, environmental protection, and poverty alleviation (cf. Hilhorst 2003). As the ''last frontier,'' Palawan's forests and indigenous peoples soon became the twin beacons of conservation and development. For many years Palawan's contiguous tropical forest and endemism were subject to indiscriminate logging by Marcos's cronies. In response, the then ''environment-first'' NGO, the Haribon Foundation, initiated a successful but controversial and divisive campaign for a 25-year moratorium on commercial logging on the island (Vitug 2000; Broad and Cavanaugh 2003). Facilitating the campaign on Palawan in 1989 was the new provincial chapter, Haribon-Palawan, which further pressured the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to accept the proposal for the moratorium (De la Paz et al. 2005); DENR officials resisted vociferously, advocating for selective harvesting and criticizing both Haribon offices. In the process leading up to what proved to be a successful moratorium on commercial logging in 1998, Haribon Palawan staff were labeled ''communists'' and pressured by the Philippine National Police (Bryant 2005). In time, Haribon shifted its focus to social and environmental advocacy, in part, through 168 D. Novellino and W. H. Dressler community-based conservation. As one director noted, ''We previously only dealt with single wildlife management issues, but moved into interrelated environmental and social issues.'' 2 Similarly, as the Palawan chapter focused on both the environmental and human rights challenges of the island, it sought autonomy from the central office in Manila. Citing strategic differences, the Palawan chapter soon became an independent organization pursuing a hybrid agenda of social advocacy and environmental conservation for the ''last frontier'' (De la Paz et al. 2005). Meanwhile, in Puerto Princesa City, various NGOs surfaced from the advocacy networks forged during days of protest and activism at universities in Manila. With offices already located in Luzon or the Visayas, branch offices were established in Puerto Princesa City; these ''extra-local'' NGOs included those with a paralegal ''indigenous rights'' function (PANLIPI—Tanggapan Panligal ng Katutubo Pilipino, Legal Assistance Centre for Indigenous Filipinos); ''environment-first'' agendas (Environmental Legal Assistance Centre [ELAC] and Haribon Palawan); and ''rural farm technology'' initiatives (Palawan Centre for Appropriate Rural Technology [PCART]) (Dressler 2009). Moreover, various local and indigenous NGOs=POs surfaced through the support of church-based networks, including, for example, the Tribal Filipino Apostolate (now the Indigenous Peoples' Apostolate ) and NATRIPAL 3 (the United Tribes of Palawan), respectively (Pinto 1999; Dressler 2009). By the mid-1990s many of these organizations soon realized that diversifying their mandate and organizing themselves as a consortium would enable them to access the DENR's new Departmental Administrative Order no. 2 (1993) and, later, the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (1997) for the preparation of ancestral domain claims (McDermott 2000; Dressler 2009 ). In doing so, the consortium of NATRI- PAL, PANLIPI-Palawan, and the TFA started the initiative ''Community-based Conservation and Enterprise Program (CCEP) for Indigenous Communities in Palawan,'' under a broader multi-layered thematic program strategy: the 4Ks, ''Karapatan, Kabuhayan, Kapaligiran=Kalikasan para sa Katutubo ng Palawan,'' referring to ''Rights, Livelihood, and Environment=Nature for the Indigenous Peoples of Palawan (Pinto 1999). 4 Shifting from specific foci to a hybrid strategy drawing on multiple themes and objectives, the consortium built on the belief that indigenous peoples' (katutubo) empowerment rested in a mélange of tenurial security, resource rights (karapatan), and livelihood opportunities (kabuhayan). The project's overall goals supported the capabilities of NATRIPAL, its federation, and its local associations of indigenous peoples in Cabayugan, Kayasan, Campung-Ulay, and Punta Baja on Palawan (Pinto 1999)—with the former two being the case-study sites of this article. The consortium worked with the provincial DENR to support livelihood enterprise developments, among others, as the basis for delineating ancestral domain claims in Cabayugan and Kayasan (McDermott 2000 ). The CCEP program supported the ancestral domain claims' objectives by assisting indigenous members gain access to and use of nontimber forest products (NTFP), enhance NTFP commodity values (e.g., rattan), and curb the encroachment of migrants upon ancestral lands. Unfortunately, however, despite extensive networks and technical expertise, adding value to harvests and improving the terms of trade for indigenous NTFP collectors was one of several market-based interventions that had failed due to insufficient attention paid to local political relations and, in other cases, the importance of swidden (Dressler 2009; Novellino 2007). The Role of ''Hybrid'' NGOsAs NGOs and government networks expanded, certain NGOs and government officials adopted and exercised strong conservationist ideologies in Puerto Princesa City (Novellino 1999Novellino , 2000Novellino , 2003). The lingering notoriety of Palawan politicians, who were no strangers to logging, was now attached to the green principles of certain NGOs. Environmentalists, policymakers, and even business people soon all embraced the paradigm of ''sustainable development,'' often crafting ''personal NGOs'' to pursue ''their'' cause (Bryant 2002b). In time, while state actors often co-opted NGOs to implement and support their own forest protection policies, other NGOs often needed the tacit approval of government legitimacy to carry forward objectives without excessive ''friction'' (Bryant 2001;). NGOs soon expedited project design and delivery by taking advantage of existing political=institutional spaces within=between themselves, government, and donor-driven priorities (Novellino 2007). Whether NGOs opposed or sided with state interests depended on their relationship with politicians and the potential outcomes of policies and projects. Such ''networked'' collaborations ensured NGOs and state objectives converged in implementing local and ''extra-local'' agendas, where project design was (and still is) based on preconceived notions of what indigenous livelihoods are, or should become, through ''development.'' This has been particularly the case with community-based conservation, where planners have often targeted indigenous livelihoods on the assumption they needed to be intensified. Hence, livelihood interventions have been geared toward sedentarizing agriculture to produce ''more with less'' for emerging markets supported by NGOs and=or provincial agencies. Most projects have ''outcome-based'' priorities, where objectives and funding conditions assumed ''tangible results'' in support of intensification. As Mosse (2005) notes, such ''official'' strategies and judgments have given authorized meaning to project outcomes as intended success, which, in our case, has been linked to ''addressing'' notions of shifting cultivators being impoverished, uneducated, and resource degrading. Related to the frequently misaligned practices of many NGOs is the morass of government-defined and donor-conditioned legislation that has negatively affected project implementation—laws that have influenced the discursive strategies of NGOs. Designing and implementing creative laws for indigenous rights and conservation—the Strategic Environmental Plan (SEP Act 1992), National Integrated Protected Areas Strategy (NIPAS 1992), and IPRA (1997), for example—have connected with the assumed legitimacy and popularity of certain management approaches at the national and international level. As we show next, ''hybrid'' NGOs and state agencies charged with implementing overlapping laws, zones, and projects have added to an atmosphere of total confusion. Indigenous communities have had to make sense of new laws, multiple programs, and projects with objectives that often conflict with their lifeways (cf. Resurreccion 2006).","doi":"10.1080/08941920902756141","journal":{"name":"Society & Natural Resources: An International Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1029}

Here, we assess the performance of a revolving fund, established by Fauna & Flora International (FFI), in delivering sustainable and equitable benefits to coastal community livelihood groups and individuals while ensuring that it did no apparent harm to the environment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 103 loan recipients to determine changes in attitude, perception and behaviour. After a 9 month preparation phase the project succeeded in changing a community view towards the fund from being overwhelmingly pessimistic to overwhelmingly optimistic and then loaned IDR 602,977,400 (USD 66,261), with near perfect repayment rates thereafter (indicating financial sustainability). Most (92%) respondents thought that the fund had been a success, mainly (56%) because it had increased their perceived daily income. Even though most (59%) of the loan recipients met with FFI staff at least once per month on average during the project, the linkages between conservation and development were only understood by some (40%). Nevertheless, understanding was highest amongst the project's main target group, fishermen. Furthermore, nearly half of all respondents said they now acted if they found people fishing with spear guns or throwing litter into the sea (a violation of customary law), indicating a positive change in behaviour. Although this study cannot unambiguously demonstrate that this change was purely due to the fund, as FFI was conducting other conservation activities, it helped to develop a strong relationship with the community and create an enabling environment for implementing this broader set of activities.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605312000622","journal":null,"aid":588}

Introduction South Africa has often received praise for its relative success in transitioning from apartheid to democracy. In addition to avoiding a full-scale civil war, the country has formulated policies, and passed legislation, that seek to redress past racial imbalances. Given that land dispossession was central to colonialism and apartheid, the land reform programme has become one of the central avenues through which post-apartheid policies and legislation can be put into practice, to improve the lives of previously disenfranchised black people, many of whom are living in poverty. The rights-based land reform programme seeks to deal with land-related injustices and improve livelihoods, through land redistribution, land tenure reform and land restitution (Cousins, 1997). However, throughout the last 15 years of the implementation of the land reform programme , researchers have either highlighted the difficulty of converting land rights into reality (Cousins, 1997; Kepe, 2004; Ntsebeza, 2007) or have forthrightly concluded that these rights have not resulted in a better quality of life for millions of the formerly marginalised population in the country (Parker, 2004). While the land reform programme in general has come under criticism for not meeting its original targets of redistributing about 30 per cent of agricultural land within the first 5 years of the programme (Hall, 2004 gained through the land claims process as the main problem (Magome & Murombedzi, 2003; Kepe, 2004). Despite all these criticisms, and recent studies such as Hall (2009), there is still a need for more studies that examine the failure of post-settlement land rights to improve land-based local livelihoods. Using the well-known case of the 'successful' Dwesa-Cwebe Nature Reserve land claim in the Eastern Cape Province, which was one of the earliest land claim cases affecting protected areas, this paper draws from the environmental entitlements framework (Leach et al., 1999) to explore the issue of rights to resources, as compared with the actual livelihood benefits received by members of the local community following the signing of the community forest agreement as part of the land claim settlement in 2001. The paper is based on long-term fieldwork, lasting between 1992 and 2008, as well as on analysis of secondary material, including official government documents. Two of the authors have closely observed the unfolding of the land claim process in Dwesa- Cwebe as part of their duties as employees of the Transkei Land Services Organisation (TRALSO), while the other two have spent much shorter research visits between 2000 and 2007. TRALSO, a land rights non-governmental organisation, helped the local communities to organise themselves and eventually lodge the land claim in 1996. Following the request to TRALSO by the villagers to assist with their fight for land rights and access to forest, grazing and marine resources within the Reserve in 1992, observations that constitute fieldwork for this paper began in earnest through monitoring the land claim settlement ceremony on of the land claim and the progress of the post-settlement support for the claim's beneficiaries. Another informal visit was undertaken to monitor the success of the claim. In all these cases, observations were made and semistructured interviews were conducted with villagers, focusing on various aspects of their livelihoods or political activities in the area. Leach et al. (1999), drawing on an entitlement analysis framework first developed by Amartya Sen (1981), attempt to explain why it is that rights that individual people or groups hold are not sufficient to yield livelihood benefits from natural resources. According to their framework, which they named 'environmental entitlements', the rights to resources, or resources that people may own (such as land), are endowments that may or may not eventually translate into tangible benefits for the people who own them. They argue that a range of formal and informal institutions mediate the conversion of these endowments into environmental entitlements, which can be understood as legitimate effective command over alternative commodity bundles or sets of utilities. Leach et al. (1999), later supported by others such as Ribot & Peluso (2003), thus encourage a view of rights not as the ultimate goal but rather as one of many steps to obtaining a benefit. More specifically, the environmental entitlements framework points to the importance of the strength or weakness of a range of institutions (such as legislation, organisations, local rules and ethics) for either enhancing or restricting people's benefit from a resource. It is in this light that the case of the 'successful' Dwesa-Cwebe land claim is examined. The paper has two main sections: first, a background description of the Dwesa-Cwebe area, including local livelihoods and the history of the land claim; and, second, a discussion of the disjuncture between the land claim settlement agreement and what is happening in practice. 2. The case of Dwesa-Cwebe's 'successful' land claim The Dwesa-Cwebe Nature Reserve is located on the 300-kilometre Wild Coast, Eastern Cape Province. It falls within the boundaries of the Transkei former Bantustan. It is made up of two forest reserves, covering about 5700 hectares, that were established in the 1890s under the Cape Colony's Forest Act of 1888, and a marine reserve (Fay, 2007a). These were consolidated into one nature reserve in 1975. Between the 1890s and the 1930s African residents were forcibly removed from the demarcated forests and were settled a few kilometres from the Reserve. These displaced residents, occupying seven villages and numbering about 14 720 people in 2382 households in 2006 (SDC, 2006), were only allowed to make use of resources within the forest through the use of permits (Palmer et al., 2002; Fay, 2007b). In 1978 the Transkei Bantustan government declared the reserved forests the Dwesa-Cwebe Nature Reserve. Thus the forests were fenced off, wild animals brought in and all use of the area by local African people, including grazing and harvesting of natural resources, was prohibited. The area in and around the Reserve has a mean annual rainfall of approximately 1200 mm and is dominated by extensive grasslands and interspersed with woodland and forest patches (Timmermans, 2004). The marine and terrestrial environments are considered highly productive and contain high levels of biodiversity, which is important to local livelihoods (Shackleton et al., 2007 ). Additionally, the Reserve is a tourist attraction , with a hotel in Cwebe and chalets in Dwesa.","doi":"10.1080/0376835X.2010.498942","journal":{"name":"Development Southern Africa","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1031}

Inland capture fisheries depend mainly on two freshwater systems, the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, with 60% of fish caught in Tonle Sap Lake (Try and Chambers 2006). Khy (2005) found that the fishing industry contributes 3.6% of gross domestic product to Cambodia's economy. In order to generate income, approximately 1 million people within eight provinces (Kampong Cham, Phnom Penh, Kandal, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Battambang, Pursat, Siem Reap provinces) rely on fishing, at least partially. Moreover, most of the people living in the floodplain engage in harvesting aquatic plants and organisms from seasonally flooded areas for a supplementary income (Department of Fisheries 2004). Due to abundant fishery resources, the Government of Cambodia has been trying to find ways to manage these resources through reforming fisheries policies and developing sub-decrees on community fisheries. In the late 2000s, according to an announcement from Prime Minister Hun Sen, about half of the total number of fishing lots was released to local people for the purpose of reducing the number and size of fishing lots. This eased tensions and mitigated conflicts among small-, medium-and large-scale fisheries. Fisheries experts have frequently recommended the establishment of community-based natural resource management institutions as a means to mitigate fisheries conflicts (Delaney 2006). Try (2003) reported that in 2000, community fisheries had been established in some villages * Corresponding author. Email: vannanuon@yahoo.com within the Ramsar site in order to tackle problems within these areas and to manage the resources. However, at that time there were no formal legal documents that officially recognised the community fisheries. About 538,522 ha of leased fishing lot areas (more than 56%) have been provided to local users and are managed by local communities (Department of Fisheries 2006). On 21 February 2004, the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries established a new office, the Community Fisheries Development Office, within the Department of Fisheries. This office, working closely with the civil society , is in charge of supporting communities to manage the fishing lots and encourage people to participate in managing fishery resources throughout the country by building capacity within the communities (Department of Fisheries 2004). According to the Department of Fisheries (2006), the ratified 2005 Sub-Decree on Community Fisheries outlines clear roles and responsibilities for the various actors involved in community fisheries to work together for the enforcement of the fisheries regulations. Delaney (2006) noted that 404 community fisheries have been established in order to enforce and build local capacities on sustainable fishing practices as an initial step. Due to the sub-decree, community fisheries plans are being developed for fishery resource conservation and management. In 2006, the National Assembly approved the new Fishery Law, which outlines a comprehensive legal framework for the establishment and management of community fisheries. However, the population is continuing to increase, and so is the demand for fish, resulting in great pressure on Cambodia's fishery resources. To keep up with demand, fishers are using both legal and illegal methods to catch fish. Illegal methods include poisoning, bomb-fishing and electrofishing , which can have effects on rural livelihoods, both socially and financially. Similarly, Timmins (2006) showed that migratory fish species are threatened by overfishing when they return to the Mekong from some tributaries. Overfishing and the significant increase in the number of gillnets also pose a potential threat to other wildlife including crocodiles, turtles and the Masked Finfoot. Moreover, poisons are applied in some areas and isolated pools within the Mekong Channel, and explosive fishing still takes place throughout the Ramsar site. This affects the fishing communities and other aquatic animals and wildlife. This paper aims to assess the outcomes in Krala Peah village community fishery management. To do so, evaluation of management performance and the objectives of the fishers were assessed. Since baseline data were not available for Krala Peah village community fishery, measurement of management performance primarily depended on the perception of the fisher households, and also in order for this research to be more empirical, the qualitative statements were converted into a numeric scores (0 = no increase, 1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high), although the scoring varied according to indicator.","doi":"10.1080/13504509.2011.584199","journal":null,"aid":591}

These parks, therefore, have a definite socioeconomic impact on adjacent communities, although little is known about this impact. The main aim of this study was to determine the socioeconomic impact of Africa's oldest marine park, namely Tsitsikamma National Park, which forms part of the newly created Garden Route National Park. This was done by conducting three surveys during April 2008: a visitor's survey (156 respondents), a community survey (132 respondents) and a business survey (11 respondents). We found that the park has a positive economic impact on the surrounding area and that the community exhibits a favourable attitude towards Tsitsikamma National Park. The results also differed when compared to similar studies conducted at other national parks in South Arica and one of the main reasons for this was that the park is located in a touristic area. For a greater impact however, the park should expand its marine activities, while communication with the local community could also be improved. Conservation implications: Good community relations and ecotourism activities are important components of good conservation practices. This research indicates that tourism activities not only generated funds for conservation, but also benefited the local communities of Tsitsikamma National Park. The positive attitude of local communities makes conservation of biodiversity more sustainable.","doi":"10.4102/koedoe.v52i1.879","journal":null,"aid":593}

However, the forest estate of Nigeria is being depleted at an unsustainable annual rate of 3.5% and the Sahara Desert is encroaching southward by about one kilometre each year. The Nigerian state-led forest management structure has failed to check this trend; hence the introduction of forest management committees (FMCs), representing a participatory (including the government) forest management structure led by the owner community. This study examines the performance of FMCs in Cross River state. Information was obtained through oral interviews with officials and a questionnaire survey of other respondents. The results of the data analysis show that the intensity of forest management practices was significantly higher in communities with FMCs than in those without. In communities without FMCs, household income from forestry was derived mainly from timber products and was significantly higher than in communities with FMCs, where forestry income was mainly from non-wood forest products. This shows the level of forestry restriction and regulation obtainable in communities with FMCs. Among the factors identified as influencing respondents' perceptions about the use of FMCs, five were positive and statistically significant: age, level of education, level of household income from forestry, regular harvest of forest products and presence of an erosion problem in the community. The Likert scale rating of the constraints encountered by FMCs indicated that the most challenging of these were: lack of commitment of members, change in government policies, financial constraints, inter-and intra-community conflicts, inadequate support from community leadership and a negative attitude on the part of the community to forest conservation.","doi":"10.5367/oa.2010.0020","journal":{"name":"Outlook on AGRICULTURE","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":595}

V.","dAbstract":"Human–wildlife conflict (HWC) is a growing problem for communities located at the borders of protected areas. Such conflicts commonly take place as crop-raiding events and as attack by wild animals, among other forms. This paper uses a feminist political ecology approach to examine these two problems in an agricultural village located at the border of Rajaji National Park in Uttarakhand (formerly Uttaranchal), India. Specifically, it investigates the following three questions: What are the ''visible \" and ''hidden \" costs of such conflict with wildlife? To what extent are these costs differentially borne by men and women? How do villagers perceive any such differ-ences? Survey and interview data were collected from over 100 individuals in the study site over a period of 9 months in 2003–2004. It was found that for participants in this study, costs of HWC included decreased food security, changes to workload, decreased physical and psychological wellbeing, economic hardship, and at times an increase in illegal or dangerous activities. The research also showed that although women in the study area bore a disproportionate burden of these effects, roughly half of survey respondents perceived that men and women were equally affected. A possible explanation for this gap considers the relationships between gendered uses of space, work, status, and identity. The findings illustrate the importance of addressing both visible and hidden costs of HWC for members of park communities and support a call for increased gender-sensitivity in HWC research.","doi":"10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.12.004","journal":null,"aid":598}

In this paper, in-depth interview and questionnaire data about resolution of HWC in Uttarakhand, India are examined from both qualitative and quantitative approaches (n=70). Responses are differentiated between and within three subgroups: gender, literacy status, and relative wealth. Overall, the plurality of respondents said that fencing is the best solution, that the Forest Department should take leadership, and that villagers would be willing to participate in a cooperative management institution. However, cooperative action was only actively supported by 27.4% of respondents, suggesting that comanagement of this protected area will require significant capacity building and trust building activities. Intragroup differences show that all three factors are significant, and underscore the importance of addressing gender differences in attitudes about HWC in particular. Women were less likely than men to support compensation, more likely to prefer that the village take leadership, and less willing to participate in a cooperative management institution. The study illustrates the value of mixed-method research, and suggests a number of specific entry points for action.","doi":"10.1007/s10745-009-9222-9","journal":null,"aid":596}

V.","dAbstract":"Many international agreements, such as the 1992 UN Convention on Biological Diversity, posit that successful community-oriented (community-based) wildlife conservation depends on partnerships with stakeholders of different class, ethnicity, and gender. Gender is of particular interest because it often relates to environmental use, attitudes, and knowledge and operates across other key categories. This study uses fieldwork, interviews, and a survey of 52 project heads in India to address two research questions: (1) How are gender issues viewed by supervisors of community-based wildlife conservation projects, in relation to their work? (2) What types of resources would be most useful to project heads seeking to promote gender equity through their conservation work? The results suggest that while there is widespread support for integrating gender equity issues into community-oriented wildlife conservation, many believe that gender may be a potentially distracting and secondary issue. Several reasons for the variation in views were identified including the following: the dearth of relevant empirical research about gender issues in wildlife conservation; ambiguities about the concept of gender itself; and a lack of opportunities to critically discuss the role of gender equity issues for conservation. These factors may contribute to a disconnection between international rhetoric and on-the-ground practice as it relates to gender and community-oriented wildlife conservation. Increased opportunities for professional capacity building among project supervisors and staff members, coupled with increased collaboration between social and natural scientists, will be important for strengthening the links between international conservation policy and on-the-ground practice.

A.","dAbstract":"This paper presents the impact of ecotourism 1 on livelihood and natural resource management in the periphery of Amboseli Biosphere Reserve in Kenya. Ecotourism initiatives that have been introduced by Porini Ecotourism, a private investor, are benefiting Eselenkei Group Ranch in terms of income, improved infrastructure, employment opportunities and exposure. Over US$5000 is received annually as land rent, gate fee and bed charges. Twenty-six Maasai men are employed for the upkeep of project facilities. The community's capacity to facilitate resource-related conflicts has improved following support from development institutions. An expanding livelihood base is reducing local vulnerability to disaster and people–wildlife conflicts. The numbers of resident wildlife species in the conservation area have increased due to regeneration of woody species and reduced frequency of livestock. Despite the achievements, ecotourism is threatened by cultivation. The latter is jeopardizing conservation efforts, as the area frequented by wildlife is being lost and people–wildlife conflicts intensified. Another dilemma is that the Eselenkei community is not effectively participating in ecotourism a situation that is associated with inadequate management and negotiation skills in the group ranch committee. The latter requires leadership and microenterprise management skills if earnings from ecotourism are to be effectively invested in alternative sources of livelihood, to reduce current and potential conflicts. There is also need to build the community's capacity for the promotion of activities that compliment ecotourism. Frequent breakdown of community boreholes lead to dependence on the conservation area for water during prolonged drought, intensifying conflicts between livestock and wildlife.","doi":"10.1002/ldr.502","journal":null,"aid":599}

But irrigated agriculture in the group ranch is leading to increased conflicts and competition for land and other critical resources. This study used semi – structured interviews with group ranch members on their interactions with wildlife, resource use and access, land use changes and livelihoods. Most group ranch members practiced agriculture as opposed to pastoralism. The community noted that critical resources such as water, pasture, plant resources and space were declining, and mostly available further from their homes. Members identified agriculture expansion and human development as the main land use changes. Most members also supported agriculture expansion as well as group ranch subdivision. Even most members supported wildlife use of their land, they were unhappy about the lack of compensation for losses. Most members wanted communal wildlife sanctuaries managed by the local community rather than a foreign investor. The competition for land and its resources due to increasing human population and land use changes is limiting wildlife use of the group ranch, and hence insularizing Amboseli Park. Potential solution is to have a negotiated land use plan that harmonizing environmental conservation and local livelihoods, while diversifying people's socio–economic opportunities to reduce poverty and dependence on natural resources.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"The Open Conservation Biology Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1035}

The objectives were to examine the contributions of home garden and community forestry to the rural development, and to investigate the plant species diversity of community forests established in the watershed areas. Rapid rural appraisal (RRA) and forest inventory were used as the main methodologies of the study. The average fi nancial value of forest products annually collected and utilized from community forests by a household of Letpanbin and Myaing were 355,500 Kyats (US$ 444) and 363,000 Kyats (US$ 454), respectively. On the other hand, the annual contribution by community forests amounted to about 33 percent of the total farming income, which is a major source of income, for each family in both villages. The species richness of Letpanbin and Myaing community forests (CF) were 75.72±5.88 and 101.20±13.29 whereas the Shannon's species diversity indices were 3.93 and 3.99, respectively. Shannon's evenness of Letpanbin and Myaing CFs were 93% and 91%, respectively. There were 3,336 (±850.83) and 3,661 (±734.15) seedlings per ha while 2,588 (±682.54) and 3,208.13 (±777.91) saplings per ha in Letpanbin and Myaing CFs, respectively.

Over a seven-month period, 156 interviews were conducted in 17 communities. Residents identified existing taboos on use of natural resources in the sacred groves, consequences of breaking the taboos, and the frequency and types of rituals associated with the sacred groves. Results show that numerous factors contribute to pressures on sacred groves, including cultural change and natural resource demands. In Meghalaya, the frequency of rituals conducted in association with the sacred groves is declining. In both Meghalaya and Karnataka, there is economic pressure to extract resources from sacred groves or to reduce the sacred grove size, particularly for coffee production in Kodagu in Karnataka. Support for traditional ceremonies, existing local community resource management, and comprehensive education programs associated with the sacred groves is recommended.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.115722","journal":{"name":"Conservation and Society","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":603}

(2) How do residents of communities on the periphery of the Park perceive and interact with Park staff, and what factors influence interactions and perceptions? A multi-method qualitative research approach was taken, including individual and focus group interviews, participant observation, archival research, and an environmental education and communication workshop. From July to December 2001, 119 semi-structured individual and group interviews were conducted with a total of 181 Masoala National Park staff, employees of non-governmental conservation organizations and community residents, focusing on two villages on the periphery of Masoala National Park. Factors found to influence the perceptions of the Park held by residents living in the Park periphery included the history of Park management, the degree of awareness of Park existence, types of interactions with Park staff and actual or potential benefits received from the Park. Inconsistency in past and present Park management goals has led to community confusion regarding the Park programme. Residents were largely aware of the Park's existence but were unfamiliar with its goals. Pressures on Park natural resources came from a variety of sources and occurred across a range of spatial and temporal scales, some of which were outside the control of Park managers.

The assessment makes use of a set of livelihoods indicators. The granting and exercise of new community rights, namely, management rights and market rights, are not synonymous with improved livelihoods, despite initial predictions and expectations. The resource base has not changed; it is more and more threatened by poor local level institutional arrangements and social and bio-physical management strategies, in addition to the weak central level regulation and monitoring actions. Similarly, the rights-based reform and community forestry are not improving basic assets and means at the household level. Nevertheless, this paper suggests that this experiment should not be judged hastily, since fi fteen years are not enough to judge social and institutional processes like those in progress in Cameroon.

This heterogeneity forms the basis of social groups, which differ in their needs, priorities and perceptions regarding community forestry implementation processes. This paper explores the dynamics of three community forestry processes—users' participation, institutional development, and decision-making and benefit-sharing— among forest user groups as perceived by three social groups of forest users—elite, women and disadvantaged—from eight community forests of Dhading district, Nepal, using qualitative and quantitative techniques. It is found that social groups have differing levels of perception about community forestry processes occurring in their user groups. In particular, social elites differ from women and disadvantaged members of the group in users' participation in community forestry activities and institutional development of forest user groups. An important policy implication of the findings is that social inclusiveness is central to the effective implementation of community forestry processes, not only to safeguard its past successes but also to internalize the economic opportunities it poses through reducing deforestation and forest degradation in the future.","doi":"10.1007/s11842-010-9136-9","journal":{"name":"Small-scale Forestry","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1045}

Introduction Forest management in Asia was largely controlled by the state and its forest service in a centralized (e.g. top-down) approach to implement 'modern' scientifically-based forest management during the mid 20th century (Arnold, 1992; Guha, 2000). By the late 1960s and early 1970s, this approach was challenged as it became clear that state control of forest resources was often ineffective in maintaining forest production and environmental quality, and that forest areas were rapidly declining due to increased demand of fuel wood and other forest products from rural populations (Fisher et al., 2007). In late 1970s, community forestry (CF) was evolved as a way to involve rural population in forest management to reverse, or at least arrest, the trend of forests decline in response to the call of state governments and international donors to address the problems of deforestation and adverse ecological effects of top-down approach of forest management (FAO, 1978; World Bank, 1978). Some of the earliest examples of CF in Asia were from Nepal, the Philippines, and India (Arnold, 1992). CF is now being practiced across the globe to engage local community in forest management and environmental conservation in context specific forms (Brosius et al., 2005; Glasmeier and Farrigan, 2005) and include a broad range of practices with respect to forest ownership, responsibility, and management authority (Edmunds and Wollenberg, 2003; Ribot et al., 2006). In Nepal, the centralized forest governance practiced after forest nationalization in 1957 and the enforcement of strict forest rules and regulations in 1960s abruptly ended the traditional forestry practices that had prevailed in the hills for generations, where local users have protected and utilized the nearby forests in a responsible manner based on local norms and values. Increased government control in forest resource management through regulatory means created distrust among local users towards the government's approach (Shrestha and McManus, 2007; Pandit and Bevilacqua, 2011). Coupled with this distrust was a heavy dependency of increasing population on nearby forests for timber, fodder, and fuel wood requirements. Collectively, this situation led to deterioration of forest conditions in the hills in the form of accelerated forest encroachment, illegal logging, and continuing deforestation (Mahat et al., 1986; Arnold, 1992). Government efforts to control these activities failed due to limited work force to enforce the rules and lack of proper forest product supply provisions to local users. Consequently, the total forest area in Nepal reduced from 42.7% (38% forest and 4.7% shrubs) in 1979 to 39.6% (29% forest and 10.6% shrubs) in (DFRS, 1999). Rampant deforestation and forest degradation in the hills under centralized forest governance created several environmental problems within and beyond Nepal's territorial boundary, including: denudation of the hill slopes, soil erosion, landslides, downstream flooding, and reduced water flow in streams and creeks (Eckholm, 1975).

Tropical forests may contribute to the well-being of local people by providing a form of \"natural insurance.\" We draw on microeco-nomic theory to conceptualize a model relating agricultural risks to collection of non-timber forest products. Forest collection trips are positively correlated with both agricultural shocks and expected agricultural risks in an event-count model of survey data from the Brazilian Amazon. This suggests that households rely on forests to mitigate agricultural risk.

For over 25 years, the Brazilian Sea Turtle Conservation Programme (TAMAR) has used ecotourism to protect sea turtles in the fishing village of Praia do Forte. The village beaches are prime nesting sites for endangered marine turtles, traditionally harvested on a regular basis, despite federal bans. Seventy-seven residents, including 25 TAMAR workers, were interviewed. Results indicate an overall support for TAMAR, turtle conservation, and implementation of ecotourism initiatives. Both TAMAR workers and non-workers were equally likely to support turtle conservation for the economic role that turtles play in the local economy, with variations in perceptions about their intrinsic or ecological values. Changes in use and values are positive indicators that education and economic benefits from ecotourism can generate support for conservation. However, such outcomes are not necessarily a result of greater stewardship but rather of changes in the social, cultural, and economic dynamics of the village. A better understanding of the factors that drive people to support conservation initiatives, both in terms of values and behaviours, are essential if conservation efforts are to succeed.","doi":"10.1080/14724049.2013.831099","journal":null,"aid":611}

Here, we focus on forest commons in human-dominated landscapes and their role in biodiversity conservation at the same time as they provide livelihood benefits to users. Using a dataset of 59 forest commons located in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, we estimated tree species richness from plot vegetation data collected in each forest, and drew on interview data to calculate a livelihoods index indicating the overall contribution of each forest to villager livelihoods for firewood, fodder, and timber. We found that tree species richness and livelihoods were positively and significantly correlated (rho = .41, p < 0.001, N = 59). This relationship held regardless of forest type or country, though significance varied somewhat across these two factors. Further, both benefits were similarly associated with several drivers of social-ecological change (e.g., occupational diversity of forest users, total number of users, and forest size), suggesting identification of potential synergies and complexes of causal mechanisms for future attention. Our analysis shows that forest commons in South Asia, explicitly managed to provide livelihoods for local populations, also provide biodiversity benefits. More broadly, our findings suggest that although strict protected areas are effective tools for biodiversity conservation, a singular focus on them risks ignoring other resource governance approaches that can fruitfully complement existing conservation regimes.","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2010.03.003","journal":null,"aid":1053}

In the case of tourism, people using protected areas can differ in many ways, including their personal characteristics and perception about the recreation environment. This research addresses the general problem of tourist perception in a marine protected area (MPA), focusing on tourists' awareness of being in a MPA, tourists' opinion on management activities, the importance of natural attractiveness components, tourists' satisfaction with recreational experience and willingness to come back, and on tourists' awareness of their environmental impacts. Data were collected by means of questionnaires, and statistical analyses were performed according to four main variables: awareness to be in a MPA, gender, education level, and place of residence. Answers, and consequently, perceptions were highly dependent on education level and the place of residence, and surprisingly the unaware tourists came from neighbouring municipalities, in particular from the province of Brindisi where the MPA is located. This research put in evidence that a different perception can be due to environmental and park related attitudes, but also to the profile of visitors who frequent protected areas. In this respect, we stress the importance of a better identification of visitors' profile, for a better management of tourism development in a MPA.","doi":"10.1016/j.landurbplan.2006.02.017","journal":{"name":"Landscape and Urban Planning","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1055}

In all five areas, forest cover (outside of protected areas) continues to decrease despite local people's recognition of the importance of forest products and services. After forest conversion, agroforestry systems and fallows provide multiple functions and valued products, and retain significant biodiversity. But there are indications that such land use is transitory, with gradual simplification and loss of complex agroforests and fallows as land use becomes increasingly individualistic and profit driven. In Indonesia and Tanzania, farmers favor monocultures (rubber and oil palm, and sugarcane, respectively) for their high financial returns, with these systems replacing existing complex ag-roforests. In the study sites in Madagascar and Laos, investments in agroforests and new crops remain rare, despite government attempts to eradicate swidden systems and their multifunctional fallows. We discuss approaches to assessing local values related to landscape cover and associated goods and services. We highlight discrepancies between individual and collective responses in characterizing land use tendencies, and discuss the effects of accessibility on land management. We conclude that a combination of social, economic, and spatially explicit assessment methods is necessary to inform land use planning. Furthermore, any efforts to modify current trends will require clear incentives, such as through carbon finance. We speculate on the nature of such incentive schemes and the possibility of rewarding the provision of ecosystem services at a landscape scale and in a socially equitable manner.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-011-9689-1","journal":null,"aid":615}

Generally, more people (68%) participated in joint forestry management meetings than in forestry activities, such as forest patrol and prescribed early burning, and the size of the household significantly influenced the involvement of community members in JFM activities. The results also showed that the social status of the local community members played a significant role in their participation in JFM activities, with the forest committee member group being the most involved (57–61%). The perception of most members of the community was that there were neither monetary benefits derived from JFM nor any significant improvement in their livelihood following JFM. Although there were high regeneration levels (10 000 saplings ha −1) for all of the species, among the selected commercial trees Pterocarpus angolensis, Baikiaea plurijuga and Colophospermum mopane had natural regeneration consisting of 118, 72 and 67 saplings ha −1 , respectively. Overall, 89% of the stems for the selected commercial species were less than 30 cm DBH, rendering them unsuitable for harvesting.

Since the end of the 1980s, there has been a popular belief in Vietnam that biological resources have been rapidly degraded. The forestry sector has produced a notable account of biological loss as a result of the reduction of forest cover from more than 40% in the 1940s to less than 30% in the 1980s [3]. In 1991, supported by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the government released an important report highlighting forest loss. The report argued that 'the most important issue in Vietnam is protection' [4], and that 'without effective support from external sources Vietnam will not be able to maintain a sufficient base for the threatened species or its natural habitat'.

{"filename":"Pinyopusarerk 2014","year":2014,"title":"Making community forest management work in northern Vietnam by pioneering participatory action","authors":"Pinyopusarerk K. and Thu T. and Tran H. and Tran V. D.","dAbstract":"Introduction The practice of community forest management (CFM) has evolved and been applied for more than two decades in many developing countries, its main purpose being the alleviation of poverty amongst local forest communities (Chandran, 2012; Dangi, 2012; Rasul et al., 2011; Duthy and Bolo-Duthy, 2003 ). Past failures of state-controlled resource management has led to changes in government policies and strategies to better involve people living in and near forests in the decision-making process (Castren, 2005; Nath and Inoue, 2010). The implementation of CFM may vary according to the needs and aspirations of the individual community . Its success, however, depends on whether community forest development targets community objectives and delivers community benefits (Roberts and Gautam, 2003). One of the most significant current policy trends associated with land reform is forest devolution, which transfers forest use rights and tenure to local communities receiving land-use certificates (Wollenberg et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2012). In Vietnam, forest management was under the direct control of the State until 1990. A series of laws and decrees, starting with the Forest Protection and Development Law 1991, have provided a new framework for greater local participation in forest management through allocation of forest land to individual households. The government anticipated that the livelihoods of local people would be improved as a result of an increase in income from agriculture and forestry activities whilst the remaining forest would be better protected. By 1999, private households had largely replaced State Forest Enterprises in managing the country's forest land with up to 10 million households, mostly in lowland areas, receiving land use certificates (Huynh, 2002). Similar practices have been adopted in Laos (Manivong and Sophathilath, 2009) and the Philippines (Guiang and Castillo, 2006), though on a much smaller scale. In Vietnam, these laws also enable individual households to exercise rights of transfer, lease, mortgage and even rights of inheritance. The Land Law 2003 and the Forest Protection and Development Law 2004 strengthened people's rights over forest land by recognizing the legal status of village communities in land tenure and forest management, thereby providing the opportunity for CFM. Right of use is confirmed by two forms of land-use certificate: the Green Book and the Red Book (NAoV, 1993). The Green Book provides limited use rights. The Red Book legalizes full use rights for 50 years for forest land and 30 years for agricultural land. Land with a clearly defined boundary is required to obtain a Red Book Certificate. As a result, much forest land remains covered by a Green Book only because of unresolved disputes over the land boundaries (IUCN, 2011; Tran, 2007 ). Difficulties in ensuring accuracy of boundaries have sometimes resulted in allocation doing little to promote security of tenure; the value of inaccurate certificates is placed in some doubt and in many areas land disputes continue (Smith, 1997). Allocation of forest land to individual households has been implemented in Vietnam since the 1990s (IUCN, 2011; Tan and Sikor, 2011; Nguyen et al., 2008; Sikor and Tran, 2007; Hoang, 2006; Smith, 1997). However, allocation of forest land is often inequitable with over-allocation to better-off households and employees of State Forest Enterprises (Le, 2008; Smith, 1997) and no allocation to some households (Tran, 2007). Ethnic minority communities in the remote mountainous provinces in the north, who are among the poorest in the country with limited access to agricultural land, health facilities, markets and infrastructure, have been particularly disadvantaged in these programs (Tran, 2007). Lack of awareness and understanding by households in these poorer communities of user rights, forest laws and regulations, and rights of participation in forest land allocation have contributed to this discrimination in the allocation of forest areas, reinforcing their poverty. Although the Land Law 2003 recognized the legal status of village communities in land tenure, to date there has been no evidence of allocation of forest land to groups of households as community entities with joint ownership (IUCN, 2011); as a result many unallocated forests in the northern upland provinces remain subject to uncontrolled and illegal exploitation. Empowering village communities to access and utilize unallocated community forests should therefore improve livelihoods of poor and landless households, at the same time leading to better forest protection and management. CFM implies equity in benefit sharing among stakeholders (Tassa et al., 2010; Gerrard, 2007; Phalla, 2007; Nguyen, 2007). Benefits can be in monetary (e.g. sharing income from sale of forest products) and non-monetary (e.g. access to subsistence resources and participation in capacity building programs) forms. There are also opportunities for communities to share benefit distribution in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) scheme (Lofts, 2012; Mohammed, 2011 ). In practice, benefit sharing is influenced by community conditions including the differing power, interests, capacities, responsibilities, and relationships between individuals and groups in the community (Yasmi and Guernier, 2008; Mahanty and Nurse, 2007). As a result, inequality in the distribution of benefits often occurs and the less-educated and poor households tend to benefit less than the better-off. The study reported here developed mechanisms for CFM in mountainous northern Vietnam. Ethnic minority people in four villages were empowered to manage community forest land under joint ownership. This was achieved through strengthening their capacity in participatory forest land-use planning and land allocation , and the development and implementation of CFM plans. This paper describes the processes by which, for the first time in Vietnam , forest villagers secured joint ownership of community forest land for exclusive-use rights, and developed plans for its sustainable management and benefit sharing. The impacts arising from this change in land management and the lessons drawn for the wider applicability of this approach are reported in the context of opportunities to improve the livelihoods of disadvantaged households by providing equitable access to community forest land.","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2013.11.019","journal":{"name":"Land Use Policy","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":618}

The Government of India introduced a non-market community-based institution, known as Joint Forest Management (JFM), for forest management and protection in 1990. JFM is a sharing mechanism for forest planning and management based on sharing of rights and duties, control and decision-making authority over forestlands, between forest departments and local user groups. By 2001, 42 000 Village Forest Committees established under JFM were managing over 11.5 million ha forestland. These institutions have proved very useful, and have contributed to forest management as well as four aspects of sustainable human development (SHD) – ecological output, income generation, village infrastructure development, and community empowerment.

The causes for this phenomenon lie in increasing rural poverty, ineffective policies to regulate hunting, as well as a ready market for many wildlife products in the Chinese medicine markets of east Asia. It is now accepted that biodiversity is ultimately lost or conserved at the local level and it is therefore imperative that the perspectives of the local people are better understood if wildlife management programmes are to be sustainable. This research uses a 'grounded theory' approach to investigate local community attitudes to wildlife utilisation and to explore what local people consider as a sustainable wildlife management strategy in remoter regions of Mongolia. The findings clearly suggest that the current situation is not conducive to sustainability either of wildlife populations or human livelihoods. Important changes are needed if sustainability is to be achieved, including alterations to property rights, greater government support, and improved marketing skills and employment opportunities from wildlife. Linked to all of the above points is the need to address the serious information deficit experienced in rural Mongolia to enable local people to examine critically the issues at hand and to participate actively in solutions.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":623}

This paper examines local perspectives on sustainability, and evaluates their similarities and differences. A systematic procedure based on criteria of proximity, pre-existing rights, dependency, knowledge of forest management, forestry spirit, daily activity, and legal rights was used to identify a small group of relevant stakeholders representing different groups, institutions, and organizations. Using participatory action research (PAR), stakeholders were asked to identify relevant indicators of sustainable forest management. The indicators identified by each stakeholder were then compared to a consolidated list assembled by field facilitators with respect to whether relevant indicators are present or not. Based on the resulting presence/absence matrix, a statistical tool called the simple matching coefficient was used to estimate the similarity measures among the stakeholders' perspectives. In addition, cluster analysis was used to classify groups of stakeholders depending on their similarities to each other. Finally, hypotheses related to the 'closeness' of perspectives among local communities, non-governmental organizations, a timber company, and government organizations, as revealed by their selection of indicators, were tested. Results show that: (a) local communities have different perceptions in terms of what they consider to be important indicators compared to the NGOs, (b) there are significantly different perceptions between the government and the timber companies, and (c) there are also different perceptions between urban and field-based personnel of the same organization. q","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.08.013","journal":null,"aid":1059}

A. and Chavez J. and Maldonado P. and De Dios M. and P.","dAbstract":"The certification of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was introduced in the early 2000s as a means of promoting sustainable community forestry and smallholders' access to profitable niche markets. Several studies have been carried out to analyze the success of smallholder certification, with a focus on its feasibility, compliance with sustainability standards and livelihoods effects. Much less attention has been given to certification as a process that promotes the empowerment and inclusion of small producers in natural resource management. Based on a study of three Amazon nut (Bertholletia excelsa) certifications (Forest Stewardship Council, organic and Fairtrade) carried out in Madre de Dios, Peru, in 2008 and 2010 this paper aims to fill part of the gap by assessing five empowerment outcomes of Amazon nut certification schemes nearly a decade after their introduction. The findings show that certification enhances producers' political empowerment (having a voice based on representation and social organization and increased self-confidence in one's ability to effect change) by increasing their organizational capacity and managerial know-how. However, limited demand, monetary benefits and economic viability are major constraints on their economic empowerment (increased assets and capabilities that enable them to benefit from new opportunities and freedom to make economic decisions). The authors argue that only stronger social organization will enable certification to break the hierarchical economic structures that disadvantage producers and prevent their replacement with new dependencies on donor and NGO support.","doi":"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2013.10.004","journal":null,"aid":624}

T. and Duc Vien T.","dAbstract":"Community-based resource management has become the latest magic bullet employed by development planners in the uplands of Southeast Asia. It is assumed that devolving power to local communities to manage natural resources will produce better results than continuing to rely on agencies of central governments. This policy has enjoyed remarkable success when applied in areas where indigenous communities are cohesive and endowed with abundant social capital. But not all ethnic minority settlements are well-endowed with social capital or able to successfully mobilize their inhabitants for collective action. Tat hamlet, a Da Bac Tay settlement in Hoa Binh Province in Vietnams northwestern mountains, is such a community, characterized by scarcity of social capital, lack of social cohesion, and limited ability to collectively manage its natural resources. In this case study, the historical background of social organization in Tat hamlet is described, and the implications of social organization for management of natural resources explored. In recent years the concept of community-based resource management has gained great popularity among governments, NGOs, and international development assistance agencies as a solution to the problems of environmental degradation [Ford Foundation 1997]. Devolving power to manage natural resources from central government agencies to local communities has become the latest in a long series of magic bullets employed by development planners working in Southeast Asias uplands. As Agrawal and Gibson [1999] have pointed out, however, remarkably little attention has been paid to the question of how the internal social organization of villages constrains their capabilities for effectively managing natural resources that are entrusted to them. The prevalent assumption seems to be that rural villages are inherently endowed with the institutional capacity to organize successful collective action to use resources in an equitable and sustainable manner. Social solidarity, that most problematic of social science concepts, is simply assumed to exist, providing the necessary basis for cooperative management of community resources.

This paper assesses the importance of farmers' forest values and the potential associations between farmers' forest values and their compliance with the tree-felling rule in Ghana. The results are derived from a survey with farmers, inhabiting fringes of forest reserves in the High Forest Zone of Ghana. With the exception of the forest value for future generations, forest values that contribute to immediate subsistence and livelihoods are perceived as the most important (i.e. environmental, subsistence and economic forest values). These values provide, among others, wide variety of foods, such as wild crops and bushmeat, farming land, medicinal plants, household items such as ropes, lianas and mats, firewood and shelter. Aesthetic and religion-related forest values are considered to be the least important. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis suggests that farmers' forest values may to some extent influence their compliance with the tree-felling rule. Economic, religion-related and learning forest values are likely to encourage compliance with the tree-felling rule.","doi":"10.1007/s11842-012-9209-z","journal":null,"aid":627}

Demand for wildlife products has resulted in unsustainable exploitation of commercially valuable species resulting in local extirpation of vulnerable species. Camera trap, track and sign, and questionnaire-based surveys were used to examine (a) wildlife species targeted by hunters, (b) the importance of wild meat for household consumption, and (c) the significance of hunting as a livelihood activity for resident villages. Certain commercially valuable species highly preferred by hunters were either completely absent from hunt records (tiger, musk deer and otter) or infrequently obtained during actual hunts (bear, pangolin). Species obtained by hunters were commonly occurring species such as muntjacs with low commercial value and not highly preferred by hunters. Fifty eight percent of respondents (n = 84) indicated trade, 27% listed subsistence use and 14% listed human-wildlife conflict as the main reason for hunting (n = 84). Average amount of wild meat consumed per month is not significantly higher during the hunting season compared to the planting season (paired t-test, P [ 0.05). Throughout the year, the average amount of fish consumed per month was higher than livestock or wild meat (Friedman test, P \\ 0.0001). Hunting is driven largely by trade and wild meat, while not a critical source of food for a large number of families could potentially be an important, indirect source of access to food for hunting families. Findings and trends from this study are potentially useful in helping design effective conservation strategies to address globally prevalent problems of declining wildlife populations and dependent human communities. The study provides recommendations to reduce illegal hunting and protect vulnerable species by strengthening park management through enforcement, increasing the opportunity costs of poaching, establishing no-take zones and research to determine the economic significance of hunting for livelihoods.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-010-9519-x","journal":null,"aid":631}

H. and Kollmair M.","dAbstract":"Introduction Despite attractive economic growth in some countries in South Asia, poverty remains a major development challenge, particularly in the Hindu Kush–Himalaya (HKH) region, for several biophysical and socioeconomic reasons (Hunzai et al 2011). Earning a livelihood in mountain areas is considerably more complex and difficult because of inaccessibility, fragility, and vulnerability arising from topographical complexity, altitudinal gradient, and poor physical and socioeconomic infrastructure (Jodha 2005; Rasul and Kollmair 2010). Rural mountain people in developing countries seem to be prone to poverty (Wymann von Dach et al 2006). Of the 210 million people in the HKH region, 66 million live in poverty and are highly vulnerable to climate and other global changes (Hunzai et al 2011). An overwhelming majority of the poor in the HKH live in rural areas and depend heavily on nature-based goods and services, including forests and non-timber forest products (NTFPs). In India alone, 270 million people depend directly or indirectly on NTFPs, including medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs), for their livelihoods (Rasul et al 2008). Thus, the livelihood security of rural mountain people depends greatly on the status and condition of the natural resources available in the forests and their optimum utilization through enterprise development (Tiwari and Campbell 1997; Saxena 2003; Mahapatra et al 2005). Realizing the importance of NTFPs for rural livelihoods, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has undertaken a number of projects for the sustainable use and management of locally available and commercially valuable natural resources, including NTFPs, to enhance the livelihood options of the rural poor in the HKH region. One of these projects focused on the communitybased management and sustainable use of MAPs and was implemented at 3 project sites in Nepal and India by national partners from 2005 to 2009. The objective of this project was to enhance livelihood options and reduce poverty in poor rural communities. A growing body of literature (Edwards 1996; Olsen 1998; Acharya 2005; Antinori and Bray 2005; Belcher and Ruiz-Perez 2005; Donovan et al 2006; Rasul et al 2008) suggests that MAPs can help sustain and improve rural livelihoods through sustainable harvesting, improved market access, and value chain development. Diverse economic actors are involved in value chain activities such as collecting, domesticating, harvesting, trading, processing, and marketing MAPs. The sustenance and Mountain Research and Development (MRD) An international, peer-reviewed open access journal published by the International Mountain Society (IMS) www.mrd-journal.org livelihoods of these actors depend directly and indirectly on MAPs (Acharya 2005; Olsen and Bhattarai 2005). Despite growing interest in the potential role of MAPs in enhancing the livelihoods of poor mountain communities, empirical evidence based on primary data is limited, and most claims are based on anecdotal evidence (Paumgarten 2005). It is, therefore, important to examine the extent to which ICIMOD's MAPs project has contributed to the alleviation of poverty and to draw lessons from it for the design of future programs and projects for livelihood improvement and poverty alleviation. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to N Assess the impact of the MAPs project on poverty and the livelihoods of the target beneficiaries and N Draw lessons and make recommendations for the design of future projects and programs in the sector for NTFPs in the HKH region. The scope of the MAPs project was much broader than the objectives of the present study, encompassing the in situ and ex situ conservation of MAPs and promotion of the sustainable use of NTFPs. However, the focus of this study is the project's impact on poverty. While poverty has many dimensions—economic, social, political, and environmental—this study focused solely on income poverty. Although the study was conducted in India and Nepal, the lessons learned should be relevant to other mountain regions where rural people depend on naturebased goods and services for their livelihoods.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":632}

G. and Galab S. and Soussan J. and Springate-Baginski O.","dAbstract":"The purpose of this article is to assess the impact of policy interventions through watershed development (WD) on the livelihoods of the rural communities. This is done by assessing the programme in the context of a sustainable rural livelihoods framework, that is, looking at its impact on the five types of capital assets and strategies required for the means of living. The article also examines the vulnerability and stability of these capital assets, as well as analysing which people participate in the programme and enhance their livelihoods through sharing its benefits. In the light of the analysis, it is argued that watershed development holds the potential for enhanced livelihood security even in geo-climatic conditions where the watershed cannot bring direct irrigation benefits on a large scale. In such fragile environments, however, watershed development is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for sustaining rural livelihoods. While the focus of watershed development is primarily on strengthening the ecological base such as water bodies (including traditional tanks), grazing lands and wastelands, it should be complemented with other programmes which focus on landless poor households in order to make it pro-poor. In the context of low rainfall regions where improvement in irrigation facilities is slow, agriculture alone cannot support the communities. Policies and programmes should aim at creating an environment for diverse livelihood activities, which are the choice of the household rather than distress activities.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":635}

Two contrasting protected areas in Honduras, a Biosphere Reserve of high biodiversity rainforest , and a cloud forest providing essential environmental services to the capital city, are analyzed in terms of their management problems and the strategies used for their protection. The response at the national level to the issues raised in these case studies is then assessed, focusing on the impact of government policies, legal changes affecting land tenure and use, and the role of state institutions in protected area management. The case studies indicate that while the non-government organizations (NGOs) have tried to promote a more participatory approach to conservation (with mixed success), the Honduras Government has tried to follow a more regulatory approach but without the resources and political will to implement it effectively. Opportunities have been missed to provide positive incentives for protection, for example in the area of eco-tourism and community-based natural forest management in situations where this would appear to be a viable option. The participatory approach has also been complicated by policies and land legislation which have sent out negative or ambiguous signals to local communities.

This case study, undertaken in two villages in the Central Himalayan foot hills in Nepal, documents the absolute and relative importance of commercial NTFPs to rural household economies. Data were collected in a one-year period and included interviews with 250 households using a semi-structured questionnaire and monthly interviews with four sub-local NTFP traders, two local traders and two central wholesalers. The conservative estimate of NTFP-derived cash income showed this to be a cornerstone in poorer household livelihood strategies and thus in poverty prevention. An annual average of 578 kg of commercial NTFPs was collected in the wild per household, providing poorer households with a cash income share of 44–78%. Better off households are not NTFP dependent but rely on income from crop production and livestock. Based on a net marketing margin analysis, showing that harvesters capture a large share of the Indian wholesaler price, it is argued that there is scope for pursuing NTFP-based strategies for poverty reduction through leasehold forestry and agroforestry. Both these options are compatible with conserving forest cover and forest corridor functions and may thus present a win–win scenario for livelihood improvement and conservation.","doi":"10.1007/s10668-010-9252-x","journal":{"name":"Environ Dev Sustain","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1069}

J. and E. S.","dAbstract":"New forest policies in South Africa seek to reconcile conservation and development objectives by devolving some responsibility for forest management from the state to local communities. Community participation in forest management aims to protect forest-based subsistence livelihoods by incorporating the interests of resource users, while simultaneously diffusing threats to biodiversity by managing resource use. To date, participatory forest management (PFM) has had mixed success in South Africa because the transfer of rights to users has not accompanied changes in policy. A questionnaire survey of 60 households (43%) revealed the attitudes of users toward current management and conservation options for iGxalingenwa forest. Users chose participatory forest management (52%) over community (25%) or state-dominated forest management (2%) structures. User choice was motivated by the desire to secure rights of access to, and ensure equitable benefit from, a dwindling resource base, rather than the conservation of these resources to sustain future yields. Users were unwilling to reduce resource use and compromise usufruct rights to achieve conservation goals, even to improve the availability of the resource stock. Current user needs compromise biodiversity conservation goals, and users regard state conservation practices as protectionist and obstructing their rights of access to resources. While the National Forests Act of 1998 seeks to conserve resources by limiting access to them and is based on principles of sustainable use, it is nevertheless perceived to offer few incentives to users to participate in forest management and conservation. Ideally, an institutional and legal framework that allocates user rights and managerial responsibilities to households is required, but clearly suitable alternatives to forest products are also vital for successful management. Greater trust between the provincial parks authority and users is needed, but is complicated by weak traditional leadership and poor community representation. Ultimately, users preferred PFM because, while recognizing that harvest rates are unsustainable, user dependence upon forest resources and weak traditional leadership means they can protect usufruct rights only by participation. Changes to any of these factors may create demands for a new management system. PFM allows the greatest flexibility for responding to changes in demands as well as the environment.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892905001979","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":642}

L.","dAbstract":"Mangroves are severely threatened ecosystems, with loss rates exceeding those of rainforests and coral reefs, stressing the need for large-scale rehabilitation programmes. Not only are ecological evaluations of such planting efforts scarce, but studies of local stakeholders' perceptions and valuation of planted areas are also virtually non-existent. This paper assesses how resource users value natural versus planted mangroves and how they perceive plantation initiatives. Semi-structured interviews with 48 resource users from two Kenyan villages show marked mangrove dependence. Respondents identified 24 ecosystem goods, and ranked a variety of food items, traditional medicine, fuel and construction materials as very important resources. Natural mangroves (11.1 ± 2.5) were rated more highly than plantations (4.8 ± 2.7) in terms of the number and quality of products, except for mangrove poles. Nine ecosystem services were acknowledged, with significant differences between natural (5.2 ± 1.1) and planted (4.1 ± 1.6) mangroves. Most respondents (71%) were positive towards the plantations, and negative attitudes were entirely based on the perception of limited information given to the community prior to planting. Multivariate analyses show distinct patterns among user groups (based on gender, occupation and locality) with respect to recognized goods and services, knowledge of mangrove species and plantations, and attitudes towards threats, community management and existing plantations. Homogeneity of responses within defined user groups accounts for these patterns. Perspectives of local users were analysed in relation to information from interviews with six managers and researchers responsible for existing plantations, as well as scientific studies on the return of ecosystem functions in planted mangroves of the area. Findings are discussed in the context of ecological knowledge, learning within social groups, village setting and history, and primary economic activity. Communication of plantation goals may be fundamental to project success and sustainability, and community participation should take into account the heterogeneous nature of stakeholder groups, in terms of perceptions and valuations of ecosystem goods and services, to avoid conflicts in future plantation use.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892907004225","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":644}

National and international demand for teak timber exceeds the sustainable yield from natural forests and plantations. High demand creates opportunities for enterprising farmers. Teak is now grown in smallholder agroforestry systems in many tropical countries. These systems enable farmers to diversify production, reduce farm risk, contribute to food security, and generate much-needed income. They also meet commercial needs for timber and improve environmental conditions. This paper reports the contributions of teak systems to smallholders' livelihoods in Indonesia, where farmers have been producing teak for over 50 years. Indonesian farmers cultivate teak as one component in integrated multispecies agroforestry systems. Annual cropping is an important aspect of these systems, producing commodities for both household consumption and market sale. Besides supplying food for households, smallholder teak systems provide 40% of household income from agricultural and timber crops. Teak and other tree crops allow households to re-allocate labor to off-farm employment when those opportunities are lucrative. However, farmers suffer from limited resources, labor, and access to information, which constrain the productivity of their teak systems. Specific recommendations are provided regarding how smallholders can adopt improved silvicultural and marketing management. Roles for government, support agencies, and industry that would provide benefits to all parties are outlined. Policy changes that would motivate smallholders to improve the management of their teak systems are identified. Conclusions and recommendations are applicable to smallholder teak systems across the tropics.","doi":"10.1080/14728028.2013.855150","journal":null,"aid":645}

Development of nature-based tourism, believed to be more environmentally benign than traditional agricultural systems, has been encouraged by governments and national park managers in the hope of providing alternative livelihoods for local people. This paper examines the extent to which indigenous peoples resettled from within one Vietnamese national park have engaged with the nascent tourism industry, thereby providing a perspective on the success of their resettlement, through the eyes of those communities affected. The perspectives of resettled peoples are contrasted with those of villagers who have continued to reside within the national park, using traditional means of survival, along with new initiatives designed to supplement their livelihoods and to reduce their dependence on national park resources for survival. Resettled villagers are unable to survive on agricultural activity alone, tourism has done little to provide an alternate livelihood and the park environment is still threatened by the use of park resources by resettled communities in their struggle to survive.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Asia Pacific Viewpoint","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1077}

{"filename":"Saayman 2009","year":2009,"title":"THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE KAROO NATIONAL PARK","authors":"Saayman M. and Saayman A. and Ferreira M.","dAbstract":"intRoDuction National parks in South Africa have three fundamental spheres: fi rstly, to conserve the biodiversity of the country; secondly, to maintain a relationship of community upliftment and capacity building with people living in the areas in and around the parks; and, lastly, to provide a recreational outlet for people to experience and enjoy the wonders of the parks (Saayman & Saayman 2006a). While the main emphasis of national parks has traditionally been on conservation, there has been a shift towards economic sustainability and the upliftment of local communities (Myburgh & Saayman 2002). It is the latter that provides the rationale for this research and, although South Africa has some of the greatest protected areas in the world, little is known about the socio-economic impact of these parks. Socio-economics is the study of the relationship between economic activity and social life (Van der Merwe 2008). The goal of a socio-economic study is generally to assess socio-economic development, usually in terms of improvements in metrics such as gross domestic product (GDP), life expectancy, literacy and levels of employment (Van der Merwe 2008), with the aim of enhancing the benefi ts received by the society. A socio-economic impact study therefore goes beyond assessing income generated by the park, and also involves the contribution of the park to the quality of life of the community (Saayman & Saayman 2006a). Eadington and Redman (1991, cited by Walpole & Goodwin 2000) state that tourism, as a development tool, holds many potential economic benefi ts for host communities, including increased employment opportunities, improved socio-economic conditions and greater market stability than are provided by traditional commodity exports. The magnitude of the economic benefi ts is dependent on the amount that remains in the area. Adding to this, Saayman and Saayman (2004) express their concern about leakages, both in the form of imported goods and imported skills, which will reduce the benefi t for the local community because most national parks are situated in rural areas. Page (2007) identifi ed four economic benefi ts of tourism, namely the generation of income for the local community; the creation of new employment opportunities; improvements to the structure and balance of economic activities in the locality; and the encouragement of entrepreneurial activity. The attitudes of residents towards tourism represent an important way in which participants contribute to policy and public support for, or dissent towards, tourism (Page 2007). Studies that were conducted on socio-economic and economic impacts include those of Loader (1994) and Pelser (2003), who argue that social involvement is an integral part of conservation in South Africa. Macleod (2001) and Fauzi and Buchary (2002) suggest that the alleviation of poverty and marginality in the case of residents of the Kepulauan Seribu Marine Park, Del Este in the Dominican Republic, should receive priority, and that park management should be based on consensus building and participation by all stakeholders. Therefore, the community should play an important role in maximising the local socio-economic benefi ts (Govender et al. 2005). An example of how the local community has focused efforts on maximising benefi ts from tourism activity as the result of a national park can be found in Mpumalanga Province. There, towns adjacent to the Kruger National Park have started to focus on offering additional tourism products, which contribute to income and employment and thereby increase the impact of the Park in the region (Saayman & Saayman 2006b).","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1078}

Every conceptualization mirrors a certain world view or belief system, i.e. the way in which we perceive and systematize 'nature'. This diversity of perceptions of nature creates favourable conditions for the growth of different, even conflicting, approaches towards assuring conservation of the natural environment. Experiences and perceptions of nature and conservation, as seen from rural populations' perspective have often been omitted in conservation policy and practice, though rural populations are closely linked to the land (Goméz-Pompa & Kaus 1992). They have first-hand understanding of their natural environment, as well as being most directly affected by policy decisions regarding land and resource use. Decision makers and conservationists in the past often tended to perceive nature as uninhabited wilderness, needing protection from human interference. Even though the IUCN (World Conservation Union) and others now have incorporated local peoples' resource use in their schemes, implementation on the ground can lag behind. Podocarpus National Park (PNP), Ecuador, is a protected area where numerous stakeholders have rather diverging perceptions of and interests in the same piece of land (Fig. 1). Since the creation of the park, various conflicts regarding land and resource use have arisen between conservationists, commercial interests and local residents. Such different groups impute and perceive different values in the natural environment; accordingly, the nature of PNP depends on the eye of the beholder.","doi":"10.1080/00291950410002430","journal":null,"aid":651}

However, a growing number of critics argue that CBNRM is susceptible to elite capture. This paper contributes to the debate on elite capture under CBNRM by studying joint forest management (JFM) in Andhra Pradesh (India) and, in particular, the case of Mohammed Nagar village. The paper addresses the following four questions: (1) How has the Indian Government formally addressed the risk of elite capture? (2) What actually happened over time when formal structures of JFM interacted with the pre-existing social structure in Mohammed Nagar? (3) When JFM results in elite capture, is this owing to the formal structures and/or the pre-existing social structure? (4) How can CBNRM be designed to avoid or minimize elite capture? Based on a reading of official government documents, the Indian Government has addressed the risk of elite capture, by ensuring representation of different social groups in the decision making bodies, regular elections, collective action in rule making and implementation, and transparency in record keeping. Nevertheless, during Mohammed Nagar's 10 years of JFM history elite capture did occur. This confirms that elite capture is a possible outcome of CBNRM. Yet, the subsequent fall of elite capture in the village also indicates that this is not necessarily a permanent outcome, and that CBNRM may in fact promote democratic and equitable resource management in the long-term. In Mohammed Nagar elite capture was largely owing to pre-existing social structures and to weaknesses in the official rules that were meant to safeguard the interests of marginalized groups. Accordingly, in CBNRM project design and implementation, pre-existing social structures' potential promotion of elite","doi":"10.1017/S0376892910000664","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1081}

An in-depth semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 161 fishers' households. The findings of the study showed that most fishers had an annual income from fishing only (80%) that was below the poverty line. Based on the fishers' perceptions, the aquatic resources were declining due to the deterioration of water quality, increased aquatic weed growth, declining fish stock, and sometimes fish death which all affected their fishing income. The fishers were highly appreciative of the role of the Department of Fisheries and local government units in fisheries management but they had a negative perception of farmers who use chemicals in agriculture because these chemicals were washed into the river, causing fish deaths. They agreed with some activities and measures such as not fishing during the spawning season and in spawning grounds, and not using illegal gear, but they disagreed with some measures such as controlling the quantity of fish caught and ruling on the number of fishers and times for fishing because these would affect their fishing income.

Information on willingness-to-pay, socioeconomic characteristics, and attitudes of participating farmers toward TFF were obtained from interviews with 581 participating farmers. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the dominant factors that might influence participating farmers' willingness-to-pay for the TFF. The results showed that participating farmers' willingness-to-pay was significantly affected by (i) family income; (ii) education level; (iii) confidence that his aspired benefits will be received; (iv) agreement with the statement that 'PFM is sustainable under the present state of management'; (v) agreement with the statement that 'PFM is a good strategy for forest conservation'; and (vi) knowledge of PFM strategies. Thus, participating farmers with a higher level of education, higher income and positive attitudes toward TFF tended to express more willingness-to-pay. Establishment of TFF could be an effective strategy in implementing sustainable PFM in Bangladesh. For this strategy to succeed, however, active partnership between the participating farmers and Forest Department is required. Participating farmers' attitudes toward TFF should therefore be taken into consideration as should the results of this study, which are important indicators of participating farmers' positive attitudes toward TFF.","doi":"10.1007/s10661-006-1488-4","journal":{"name":"Environmental Monitoring and Assessment","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1085}

Fisheries sector contributes 4.3 % to the agricultural GDP and export earnings are presently valued at over Rs. 6,800 crores from a volume of 4.6 lakh tonnes. In addition, it provides direct and indirect employment and dependency for over seven million people in the country. With an estimated production potential of 8.4 million tonnes, the present level of production in the country is 5.9 million tonnes with almost equal contribution from both the marine and inland fisheries. The estimated fisheries potential from Indian Exclusive Economic Zone was found to be 3.9 million tonnes. But inspite of the increased efforts in fish production, the catch stagnated around 2.9 million tonnes. The stagnation in catches mainly due to the overexploitation of dwindling marine resources forced the government to impart some management measures to regulate the fishery and for the sustenance of the marine resources. The monsoon trawl ban in fisheries was one of the major reforms, which had created a substantial increase in fish production in the past few years. The ban on trawling during monsoon season was introduced in Maharashtra, after a series of studies, from 1992 for a period of 65 days form June 10 to August 15 (or Naralipoornima whichever is earlier). A notable increase in production from the marine sector of the country occurred in the post-ban period. Nevertheless, it had created problems in employment, poverty and income distribution of fishermen during ban period and was always a matter of unrest among mechanized and traditional sector of fishing. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of ban on monsoon trawling in employment pattern, poverty and income distribution of fishermen along the western coast of Maharashtra. The study was conducted at Versova fishing village, Mumbai and provides reflections on the possible impact of monsoon ban on the livelihood and standard of living of the fishermen in the state.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1086}

It involved two communities surrounding the park, namely Pete and Kitogani. Field data were collected using structured questionnaires , key informant interviews and field observations. Questionnaires were administered to 76 households, whereas key informant interviews were conducted with foresters and JCBNP officials. Data analysis was under-taken using standard statistical methods. Findings from the study show that biodiversity management in the JCBNP has improved considerably after the introduction of ecotourism. The number of endemic colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus kirkii) and other rare species has increased. However, this achievement has been attained by restricting surrounding communities from using forest resources without providing alternative sources of livelihood. Findings also show that the benefits from ecotourism do not reach individual households, but the community as whole, in form of various social services. This has caused some resentment among the local people leading to their reluctance to reduce their direct use of ecosystem services available in the JCBNP, claiming that they cannot sustain their livelihood without such services. This has become a major source of conflict between the JCBNP and surrounding communities. Increased awareness and knowledge on biodiversity conservation would be needed for the communities surrounding the park to realize the potential and long-term benefits of ecotourism, and hence the need for their increased involvement in biodiversity management.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":652}

M.","dAbstract":"In the highland ecosystems where actions by some individuals or groups often generate off-site effects among a wide range of social actors and stakeholders, the use and management of natural resources are susceptible to multiple forms of conflicts. This paper examines the hypothesis that conflicts constrain the adoption of agroforestry technologies. Using empirical data from 243 households in Kabale-Uganda, the study identified over 780 different cases of conflicts , and found positive relationships between certain types of conflicts and adoption of agro-forestry technologies. The results of this paper challenge the conventional wisdom that conflicts are pervasive, and that the prevalence of conflicts is a major barrier to the adoption of NRM technologies. On the contrary, they seem to suggest that conflicts may have some positive outcomes; they provide incentives for the adoption of NRM technologies, and can be a potential force for positive social change. Conflicts are an essential feature of NRM in the highland systems and cannot therefore be ignored. What matters is the ways such conflicts are managed and resolved, and transformed into a force for positive change. We found that three dimensions of social capital (collective action, byelaws implementation and linking with local government structures) have increased the ability of communities to manage and transform conflicts into opportunities for collective action. These findings suggest new areas for further investigation to improve understanding of adoption decisions and building local capacity for scaling up the impacts of agroforestry innovations.","doi":"10.1007/s10457-006-9018-5","journal":null,"aid":1089}

It provides a legislative basis to redress the historical injustice forest dwellers in the country, including in Odisha, have been subject to. It thus has major implications for them, both in promising them a more secure basis for their livelihoods and in providing them with legal provisions to defend their rights in the future. The implementation of the FRA in Odisha began without proper sensitisation of the implementing agencies, or proper dissemination of its different aspects among stakeholders at the local level. This has led to confusion among the potential benefi ciaries about the proper procedure for applying to get the benefi ts they are entitled to, and wrong or arbitrary interpretation of different provisions of the Act by the implementing agencies. It is likely to lead to the exclusion of many potential benefi ciaries, given their low levels of literacy and awareness, and their inability to plead their cases with all the supporting documents. There is also the likelihood of the implementing agencies rejecting many genuine claims on fl imsy grounds. For, the state, through the forest bureaucracy, has been controlling forests and forest products for a long time by restricting the rights of forest dwellers. It could be tempted to create obstacles in implementing the different provisions of the Act, especially since it enjoys higher bargaining power vis-à-vis the poor tribals (Reddy et al 2011). The evidence in this paper shows a narrow perspective has governed the implementation of the FRA in Odisha. It has focused more on granting rights to individual claimants, rather than taking a holistic view of the different provisions of the Act. The result has been the exclusion of many potential benefi ciaries, who in turn are unable to apply for their rights because they lack awareness of the provisions of the Act and there has been no state or parastate action to reach out to them. In such a situation, the FRA's objective of reducing the multiple deprivations of forest dwellers is being substantially watered down. The process of implementing the FRA in the study area is discussed in Section 1. Its outcome in terms of coverage and the type of land rights given are discussed in Section 2. The probable benefi ts of the FRA on the livelihood of benefi ciaries are discussed in Section 3.

We have used 38 indicators to measure social capital based on three generic criteria, the number of indicators for productivity, equity and sustainability being 16, 7, and 15 respectively. Earlier, Mukherjee (2002) used 15 indicators in order to measure social capital in the context of four FPCs of the JFMP under three generic criteria – productivity, equity and sustainability with 5, 4 and 6 indicators respectively. She assigned equal weights to all the indicators for the sake of simplicity, though in practice the weights tend to differ across criteria. D'Silva and Pai (2003) used 10 indicators to measure social capital without any categorization in the context of JFMP in two villages and Watershed Development Programme in one village. Mainly, we have followed the indicators under three generic criteria of Mukherjee (2002) and imparted equal weights to all the indicators but the distribution of indicators have been increased to make those indicators simple and conceivable to the respondents. The main criteria related to productivity in the measurement of social capital in this exercise includes: a) Social structure; b) Leadership; c) Group membership and sense of responsibility; d) Group capacity and level of confidence; e) External linkage; f) Status of financial capital base; and g) Technologies and improvement. Two important indicators related to 'social structure' 9 are: 1) Social cohesion – presence or absence of hierarchy: if it is present, how rigid or flexible it is; and 2) Endemic factionalism – factionalism among a particular class/group of people: the less the factionalism exists among a particular class/group of people, the greater the social capital is built. Four indicators of 'leadership' are: 1) Selection of leader – the more the consensus or democratic functioning among the people for selecting leader, the higher is the scope of building social capital; 2) Sense of responsibilities to execute public work – higher sense of responsibility by the leader to perform public work is favorable for building social capital and ensure collective actions; 3) Local network of political leaders and forest officials – higher network influences higher facilitative role in establishing and supporting FPCs; and 4) Leader's presence and accountability in the group meeting – frequent group meeting between leader and general members and his responsibility to fulfill obligation of group activities facilitate higher coordination and trust among them. The indicators related to 'group membership and sense of responsibility' include: 1) Sense of responsibility and role of members to group work – higher responsibilities and active role of members are favorable for building social capital; Active supporting role of officials – active supporting role by forest officials and other public officials along with local panchayet bodies in building action plan for JFMP, financial grant for action plan, raising awareness and social motivation, etc. are the necessary inputs into the process of building social capital. 2) Group-based micro credit programme – high activity of micro-credit programmes among the FPC members is an indicative of higher process of development network among the group members. As an indicator of 'productivity' the 'status of financial capital base' is used to signify that higher financial capital base for FPC ensures higher execution of group action plan and coordinated actions. 'Technologies and improvement' under 'productivity' help to create higher growth of trees (both timber and non-timber) including HYV seeds for the species, advanced technology for new plantation, regular water-supply facilities, etc. influencing coordinated actions among the group. are: 1) Rigidity of functioning FPC (higher flexibility of functioning of FPC by the forest officials may hamper sustainable JFMP); 2) Share of periodical benefit (as per commitment) of timber products; 3) Share of members from non-timber forest products (NTFPs); and 4) Period of collection of NTFPs. If the members receive 100 per cent share of NTFPs and free to collect fuelwood, leaves, fruits and other NTFPs throughout the year, higher is the possibility by the members of forest communities to save the timber products influencing effective conservation and rapid regeneration of forest resources. The indicators relating to 'ability to raise issue and resolve conflict' include: 1) Ability to raise issue in meeting by any member; and 2) Ability of the group to resolve conflict. The indicators for 'maintenance of assets' as a measurement of 'sustainability' relate to: 1) Maintenance of assets created (like fencing wall, planted species, timber); 2) Attempt at soil conservation and protecting soil erosion; 3) Training to the members by officials for maintenance of assets; and 4) Plantation. If there is acute shortage of water for plantation or/and lack of initiative for plantation or/and lack of funds for plantation, it may create adverse impact on the sustainability of forest resources and of JFMP.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":656}

This model treats human societies as being irreducibly integrated with the natural systems in which they are embedded. It argues that any concept of biodiversity necessarily embodies cultural values for it to be operationalized for conservation decisions. It accepts the legitimacy of tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation and other values including human resource development. It prioritizes local control of decisions in regions which are often targeted by Northern conservationists: areas of the South, where cultural choices have led to the persistence of high biodiversity. This model is used to analyze an ongoing dispute over biodiversity conservation and natural resource control in Perú: the conflict over Kandozi territory in the Abanico del Pastaza. What the Kandozi want is more than just a rejection of what has been criticized as the national park/fortress model of conservation. It consists of an assertion of local institutionalized control over traditional lands which goes well beyond the purview of the usual alternative of the fortress model: the biosphere reserve model of external and internal joint control of natural resources. To the remarkable extent that Kandozi resource management practices have succeeded in maintaining biotic richness and variety in spite of multiple encroachments, the empirical evidence demands that today's conservationists pay adequate attention to these practices and the social institutions in which they are embedded. But, beyond such prudential concerns, the social ecology model of habitat conservation accepts the normative claims that resident communities should have control over their lands and livelihoods and that they should be allowed to maintain their habitats as cultural landscapes of their choice.","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2010.03.008","journal":null,"aid":653}

People in northern Bangladesh had somewhat more positive attitudes towards conservation than those in the southeast. The two most important variables explaining respondents' attitudes towards conservation were the distance they lived from protected areas and their monthly income.

E. and Ter Braak J. F.","dAbstract":"Protected forests are sometimes encroached by surrounding communities. But patterns of cover change can vary even within one given setting – understanding these complexities can offer insights into the effective maintenance of forest cover. Using satellite image analyses together with historical information, population census data and interviews with local informants, we analysed the drivers of forest cover change in three periods between 1973 and 2009 on Mt Elgon, Uganda. More than 25% of the forest cover of the Mt Elgon Forest Reserve/National Park was lost in 35 years. In periods when law enforcement was weaker, forest clearing was greatest in areas combining a dense population and people who had become relatively wealthy from coffee production. Once stronger law enforcement was re-established forest recovered in most places. Collaborative management agreements between communities and the park authorities were associated with better forest recovery, but deforestation continued in other areas with persistent conflicts about park boundaries. These conflicts were associated with profitability of annual crops and political interference. The interplay of factors originating at larger scales (government policy, market demand, political agendas and community engagement) resulted in a ''back-and-forth'' of clearing and regrowth. Our study reveals that the context (e.g. law enforcement, collaborative management, political interference) under which drivers such as population, wealth, market access and commodity prices operate, rather than the drivers per se, determines impacts on forest cover. Conservation and development interventions need to recognize and address local factors within the context and conditionalities generated by larger scale external influences.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":657}

These 'local' projects are interlinked with global networks of conservation interests that provide technical expertise and resourcing. In the Jozani-Chawka Bay area, project planners brokered a community governance and benefit sharing agreement that has been lauded as a watershed moment for conservation policy in Zanzibar. Key hurdles for establishing Zanzibar's first national park, the Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park, were limiting community access to customary forest resources, farmer-red colobus monkey conflict, and setting up a supportive institutional arrangement. The conflict resolution and institutional strategies adopted by the conservation planners with the aid of international funding provide insights that help explain why the project has been able to maintain a 'fragile' localised compliance with conservation goals at the Jozani-Pete village. This has been achieved despite lingering resentment over red colobus crop damage claims, and perceptions of insignificant conservation related benefits flowing to individuals and communities. This finding raises broader concerns about whether containment strategies to ground fragile project arrangements are conducive to engendering the longer term support of local communities for new generation Integrated Conservation Development Projects.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.92138","journal":null,"aid":1094}

But population growth and the timber industry have led to severe pressure on natural resources. Caught between external and internal views of use and conservation, mountain communities have found it difficult to determine a sustainable course of action. Conservationists regret that little \" pristine \" environment is left to preserve. However, even in remote places \" Nature \" in Madagascar has co-evolved over centuries with \" Culture \" and vice versa. A strict biodiversity hotspot and protected area focus is therefore incomplete and unrealistic. For developing countries with a colonial history, this \" monotheistic \" approach smacks of paternalism, is often disrespectful to local people, and easily overlooks traditional value systems, indigenous knowledge, and local solutions. Fortunately, in 1996, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, a new law for secure local management, the \" GELOSE \" (Gestion Locale Securisée, No. 96-025), was promulgated, permitting devolution of natural resource management rights, duties, and responsibilities from the state to local communities. This decentralization of power and management capacity officially opened the door to initiating an important change in the relationship between those involved: previously half-hearted stakeholders were encouraged to become serious and committed shareholders; this, in turn, constituted an excellent basis for introducing the approach of Voluntary Protected Areas (VPAs), a concept coined by the IUCN to denote self-help conservation initiatives.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Source: Mountain Research and Development","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":658}

J. and Lassoie J. P. and Schelhas J. and Sherman R. E. and Fahey T. J. and Lassoie J. P.","dAbstract":"National parks have complex relationships with local communities that impact both conservation success and community well-being. Integrated conservation and development projects have been a key approach to managing these relationships, although their effectiveness has been increasingly questioned. Park–people relationships of the Armando Bermudez National Park in the Dominican Republic were studied, focusing on forests, aquatic resources, community well-being and development , and ecotourism. The park, established in 1956, is well respected by the community, based on its long history and its role in protecting water resources that are critical to the community. However, management of riparian vegetation and local fisheries present challenges in terms of finding a balance between conservation and development. Hiking and trekking opportunities attract both national and international tourists to the park, and community members benefit from employment as tour guides and providing mule rentals. At the same time, tourism activities also present continuing challenges related to: (1) the distribution of tourism benefits between local people and outsiders, and within the local community, (2) maintaining the local economic benefits of tourism while protecting park resources, and (3) developing park-or conservation-related economic opportunities to complement tourism. The results highlight the need to develop site-specific strategies to manage park–people relationships through interdisciplinary analysis. of such areas can be accomplished in a number of ways. One strategy is to provide economic opportunities to local communities directly related to the park, such as employment by the park, employment in the tourism industry, sale of food and handicrafts to tourists, provision of services to local communities, and allowing traditional land uses (Zube and Busch, 1990). Another strategy is the development of economic opportunities outside the park that reduce economic dependence on park resources, such as agricultural, agroforestry, forestry, or fisheries projects. Recently, the compatibility of conservation and development has been questioned from several perspectives. Redford and Sanderson (1992) argue that conservation and sustainable development are fundamentally incompatible and that efforts to simultaneously pursue both objectives have had few successes. Brandon (1998) and Langholz (1999) have found that economic development projects in communities adjacent to parks may be successful only in changing the nature of the threats to the park — rather than eliminating them. On the other hand, pragmatic approaches have shown that linkages between conservation and development are complex and sometimes counterintuitive and even intensive agricultural development can be compatible with park protection (Brandon, 1998; Schelhas, 1992).","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Natural Resources Forum Natural Resources Forum","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":659}
{"filename":"Schelhas 2005","year":2005,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"Forest Conservation and Environmentalism in Costa Rica Costa Rican conservation history encompasses rapid deforestation associated with frontier colonization followed by a multi-pronged government response. Forest lands in Costa Rica were long viewed as unused land open to settlement by anyone willing to convert forest to agriculture (Brockett and Gottfried 2002). Deforestation proceeded slowly until the 1950s, increasing rapidly in the 1970s when the humid lowlands were opened up for banana plantations, cattle pasture, and frontier settlement (Carriere 1991, Evans 1999). Rapid deforestation proceeded through the 1980s and was driven by a demand for land and not for timber, with the majority of the timber cut, burned, or left to rot (Brockett and Gottfried 2002). While agriculture and pasture were a part of the frontier dynamic, the rapid rate of deforestation was driven more by a preference for investment in land in a highly inflationary economy and related land speculation than by a need or desire to establish productive land uses (Schelhas 1996Schelhas , 2001 ). Motivated in part by laws that favored cleared land over forests in claiming and titling land as well as to discourage squatters, landholders of all sizes converted forests to agriculture and, most frequently, pasture (Schelhas 1996Schelhas , 2000). Significant conservation efforts began in Costa Rica in the 1960s. The 1969 Forestry Law and subsequent revisions required permits for any tree cutting and a technical study showing that cleared land could be used sustainably after forest clearing (Brockett and Gottfried 2002, Watson 1998). Although this regulatory approach looked good on paper, in practice, underfunded agencies could not enforce the laws, seldom got out into the field, and had a record of bureaucratic delays and corruption (Brockett and Gottfried 2002). At the same time, the difficulty in acquiring permits meant that landowners often had to rely on loggers who had the necessary connections (and sometimes paid bribes) to get permits. Loggers often paid low prices and high-graded timber (Brockett and Gottfried 2002). A second policy approach was to provide incentives for forest conservation. Government fiscal incentives for reforestation began in 1979, incentives for forest management began in the early 1990s, and payments for environmental services from intact forest (e.g. carbon sequestration and watershed protection) began in 1996 (Brockett and Gottfried 2002, Watson et al. 1998). Many of these incentives have favored large landowners and those possessing title to their land, although several programs have sought to make these incentives more widely available to the many small landowners who possess legal rights to land but not title (Thacher, Lee, and Schelhas 1997, Utting 1994, Watson 1998). Creation of national parks and other protected areas is a third important way that forest conservation has been implemented in Costa Rica. Parks and protected areas in Costa Rica date back at least to 1945, but significant establishment and management of parks and reserves began in the 1970s, when a few key individuals led a very successful effort that generated internal political support in Costa Rica at the highest levels, international support from conservation NGOs and international aid agencies, and widespread public promotion of the parks both within and outside of Costa Rica (Brandon, Redford, and Sanderson 1998, Boza 1993, Evans 1999). By the mid-1990s, 11% of the country was in national parks, and additional 13% in biological reserves, national forests, national monuments, and national wildlife refuges. Costa Rica's protected area system was generally considered to be exceptionally well-managed and staffed (Evans 1999). Over the same time period, relationships between national parks and private land owners and neighboring communities have been marked by difficulties. Land or the opportunity to use it was taken away from private landowners when many parks were created, and the owners of large portions of many parks are still awaiting payment for expropriated lands (Brockett and Gottfried 2002, Utting 1994, Watson et al. 1998). Those who had worked in or used forests but had no formal land rights were expelled from protected areas without compensation or assistance in relocation or finding new employment (Schelhas 1991, Utting 1994). Local communities have generally been excluded from processes of establishment and management of protected areas, and neighboring areas have often received few employment benefits while suffering negative impacts on development due to displacement of farmers, outmigration of community members, deterioration of roads and other infrastructure that had been maintained by communities, and land speculation (Utting 1994, Watson et al. 1998). The national parks in Costa Rica have played a key role in the rapidly expanding tourism industry in the country, which has been a leading earner of foreign exchange for the country since in the early 1990s (Campbell 2002, Evans 1979, Watson et al. 1998). The business community and tourism agencies have promoted ecotourism and its link to economic gain, and the view that non-consumptive forest uses could generate both economic and environmental benefits has become wellestablished in Costa Rica (Campbell 2002, Evans 1999). As Costa Rica became an international leader in conservation, it has also served as the site for a number of major international meetings and programs and seen a proliferation of conservation NGOs (Evans 1999). There has been a corresponding attention to the environment in the Costa Rican media and other aspects of society. As a result, environmentalism has become an object of Costa Rican pride and national identity (Evans 1999, Schelhas 2001).","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Human Organization","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1097}

Park managers have tried different approaches to managing relationships with local people, but nearly all include efforts to promote environmental values and behaviors. These efforts have had uneven results, and there is a need to improve our understanding of how environmental values develop, change, and influence behavior. We investigated this question in a study of communities in and adjacent to national parks in Costa Rica and Honduras, using a mental and cultural model approach. We found local people to be fluent in global environmental values, but some common values had limited impact on behavior due to conflicts with livelihood needs. However, new environmental values that integrated conservation and livelihood needs had developed that had a more direct relationship to behavior. We propose a general model of how local environmental values develop in the context of global environmentalism that can be used to guide outreach programs with park neighbors.","doi":"10.1111/j.1755-263X.2009.00079.x","journal":null,"aid":1096}

Sixty per cent of the original tropical rainforest has been destroyed, degraded and/or used for timber exploitation (Treves and Weber 2001). As early as 1898, the powers-that-be established protected areas to counteract this deforestation in Africa. The forest in the southwest corner of the Republic of Cameroon, regarded as one of the oldest of its kind in Africa (Maley 2001), has been protected since 1937 as the Korup Native Administration Forest Reserve. The name of the forest and of its conservation structures (Korup National Park, Korup Project, etc.) arises from the ethnic group who live in the middle of this remote area between Cross River and Mungo. Research has revealed that the Korup Forest is home to more than 3000 species of trees, plants, insects and animals, including 25 per cent of Africa's primate species (Gartlan 1984). Based on the research of Thomas Struhsaker (1970), Stephen Gartlan (1984) and Phil Agland (1981) , the first conservation activities were carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s by the Earthlife Foundation. Starting in 1971, the above-mentioned researchers continuously appealed to the Cameroonian government for the Korup Forest Reserve to be transformed into a National Park (Oates 1999 ). The rising awareness of conservation , and especially the willingness of international donors to support conservation of the tropical rainforest in Cameroon, resulted in the creation of the Korup National Park by presidential decree in 1986 (No. 86/1283, October 30, 1986). The park, which is larger than the former forest reserve (842 km 2 ) and covers an area of 1259 km 2 , soon became famous.

An appreciation for the economic and ecological roles of large carnivores cannot be expected to improve if the correct information is lacking and misconceptions persist. Conservancies are growing in importance in the conservation of Namibia's wildlife outside protected areas and may be important structures for information dissemination and improving wildlife management. This study investigated the role that farming enterprise (livestock and mixed livestock/game farming) and conser-vancy membership played in human–large carnivore conflict on commercial farms in Namibia. Our study found that the attitude towards large carnivores was similar between farming enterprises but that conservancy members within each enterprise were more likely to be tolerant of large carnivores and to use livestock management options to reduce conflict, than non-conservancy members. Cause for concern however, was the high proportion of all farmers, including those belonging to conservancies, which reported removing large carnivores from their farms. This aspect is reflected in the poor content of conservancy management plans with regard to large carnivore management and human–large carnivore conflict mitigation measures. The failure to incorporate guidelines pertaining to human– carnivore conflict management into conservancy management plans reflects the lack of a structured approach to solving this conflict on farmlands.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":661}

U.","dAbstract":"Conservationists in the recent years view local peoples' support for protected areas management as an important element of biodiversity conservation. This is often linked to the direct benefits, which local communities get from the protected areas. These benefits could be in the form of biomass resources, park funds diverted to local villages by state agencies and revenue from wildlife tourism. There are a very few studies which have attempted to study the direct relationship between benefits from wildlife tourism and local support for conservation. In India, wildlife tourism is restricted, and mostly controlled by state and private agencies. Wildlife conservation policy does not view tourism in protected areas as a source of revenue for the local communities. The present study examines the local people's attitudes towards wildlife tourism and the impact of benefits from tourism on the local support for Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), India. STR is a flagship for tourism where protected areas are increasingly being visited and where local support for wildlife tourism has not been studied adequately. Results indicate that two-thirds of the respondents were positive towards tourism and support for conservation. The respondents were aware that more tourism benefits are possible from a well-conserved protected area. There appears to be correlation between benefits obtained by local people from wildlife tourism and other sources, and support for protected area existence, suggesting that benefits impact people's attitudes towards conservation. Some of the main problems are the unequal distribution of tourism benefits, lack of locals' involvement in tourism and development. There is a need to clearly address these issues, so that protected areas may get the support of local people, which may lead to sustainable development. q","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2003.09.002","journal":null,"aid":663}

However, information on the extent of livestock depredation by cheetah and farmers' perceptions of this has been lacking. We interviewed 123 farmers in Ghanzi District, Botswana, to assess problems caused by cheetah depredation of livestock and farmers' attitudes towards cheetah conservation beyond protected areas. Despite livestock losses, farmers generally supported efforts to conserve cheetah, with support increasing with level of education. However, farmers felt that cheetah should not be conserved within farming areas. Land-use practice and culture related to land use played a major role in determining the level of farmers' support for cheetah conservation beyond protected areas: high on private farms, moderate in wildlife management areas, and low on communal lands. Underreporting by farmers led to underestimation by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks of the extent and nature of cheetah conflict with farmers. This study suggests that education and active involvement of farmers in planning and decision-making concerning cheetah management would enhance farmers' positive perception of cheetah conservation beyond protected areas.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605308001154","journal":null,"aid":1105}

R. and Shackleton C. and Timmermans H. and Nongwe N. and Hamer N. and N. and Palmer R.","dAbstract":"It is now widely appreciated internationally that rural communities make extensive use of wild resources, and that this use has significant direct use value. The number of case studies in South Africa that have valued the use of such resources are small, albeit growing. Yet none of them have been from coastal sites, which would include use of marine resources, nor have previous studies included the non-biological resources of sand and clay for building purposes. This paper addresses this gap, through examination of the role and value of wild resources in rural livelihoods of households in the Ntubeni and Cwebe areas of the Transkei Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape. Households used a wide range of resources collected from the surrounding communal lands and the Dwesa Cwebe Nature Reserve. Major differences between the sites were the widespread use of bushmeat, shellfish and building sand at Ntubeni compared with relatively small use of these three resources at Cwebe. These differences resulted in a markedly higher, gross, annual, direct-use value at Ntubeni than at Cwebe. The gross, annual, direct-use value averaged across all resources (excluding medicinal plants) and all households (user and non-users) was over R12 000 at Ntubeni, compared to R4 858 at Cwebe. At Ntubeni over half of the total annual direct-use value was contributed by fish and shellfish, indicating the need for more studies in coastal areas. A similar pattern was not evident at Cwebe, because residents did not have access to a rocky shoreline outside of the marine reserve. Local trade was highly variable, both between resources and between households. Averaging the value of trade across all households (i.e. traders and non-traders), gave a total gross, annual value of R1 660 and R600 at Ntubeni and Cwebe, respectively.","doi":"10.1080/03031853.2007.9523764","journal":null,"aid":664}

In the mountainous region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan (previously known as North West Frontier Province, NWFP) the process of institutional changes in forestry sector was also started in the mid nineties and now participation to local stakeholders has become a significant feature of the forest policy of the province. To confer practical look to the participatory forestry, village level institutions were established in the selected villages for the management of forests and carrying out developmental activities. In this milieu, this paper attempts to assess the net correlation between participation in forest management and livelihood assets of the forest dwellers by using sustainable livelihoods framework. The results showed that there was positive relationship (net correlation) between participation and the access of the respondents to social and natural assets, but other livelihood assets (financial, human and physical) remained unchanged. It is recommended that sustainable management of forest resources necessitates that the forest conservation initiatives should be coupled with the enhancement of financial and human capital of the communities living in or around forest areas.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":665}

Balanced assessments are rare, however, particularly in West Africa. This paper examines the first 10 years of Ghana's Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary using an evaluation framework that considers socioeconomic and ecological outcomes, as well as resilience mechanisms. Building upon traditional taboos against the killing of hippopotami, this initiative has attempted to conserve an imperilled large mammal, protect biodiversity and alleviate abject poverty amidst a bush meat crisis and complex ethnic diversity. Findings show that the Sanctuary has improved local livelihoods by spurring economic diversification and infrastructure development rates 2–8 times higher than in surrounding communities. Simultaneously, threats to biodiversity have subsided, hippopotamus numbers have remained stable and the Sanctuary's riparian habitats now harbour more bird species than comparable areas nearby. Improved social capital, true empowerment, an equitable distribution of benefits, ecological awareness among children and support for the Sanctuary, even amongst community members who were disadvantaged by its creation, speak to good long-term prospects. Risks remain, some of which are beyond the community's control, but evidence of socioecological resilience suggests that capacity exists to buffer risks and foster sustainability. Lessons learnt at Wechiau translate into recommendations for the planning, implementation and evaluation of future community-based conservation initiatives, including greater interdisciplinary integration and the use of adaptive co-management approaches.","doi":"10.1017/S037689291000041X","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":666}

Increasingly, these areas are expected also to contribute to sustainable development and deliver benefits to local communities (Blom, 2010). It has been argued that, to be effective in assisting biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, protected areas need to be integrated within a broad sustainable development planning agenda (Mansourian, Higgins, Dudley, & Stolton, 2008). Conservationists especially in biodiversity-rich countries of the developing world, such as Tanzania, have thus been challenged to design effective biodiversity conservation strategies to meet both conservation and development goals (Bookbinder, Dinerstein, Rijal, Cauley, & Rajouria, 1998). One strategy that has been identified as an ideal mechanism for attaining both # 2013 Taylor & Francis * Corresponding author.

In other words, eco-tourism is considered to be both an economic and conservation strategy, which fosters positive residents' attitudes towards conserving protected areas (Hearne & Santos, 2005). According to Munn (1992), eco-tourism provides a means through which local people can gain economic benefits thereby reducing pressure on the physical environments by abandoning unsustainable resource use practices. Although there are many controversies over an exact definition of eco-tourism, many experts in eco-tourism assert that eco-tourism should have low impact on nature, with a goal of benefiting both conservation and the well-being of local communities (Guangming et al., 2008; Lindberg, Enriquez, & Sproule, 1996 ). With this in mind the International Ecotourism Society defines eco-tourism as 'responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people' (Orams, 1995, p. 5). This definition makes local benefits a prerequisite for tourism to be categorised as eco-tourism (Tisdell, 2003). Also, in order to achieve conservation goals, an appreciable amount of revenue must return to local communities living next to or within conservation areas to encourage offsetting the often substantial costs of protection or conservation (Walpole, Goodwin, & Ward, 2001). Thus, unless natural protected areas make tangible economic sense, local residents will often turn against them and lead to failure in conservation (Lindberg & Huber, 1993). Tanzania is one of the economically poor but amongst the biodiversity-rich countries in Africa (Nelson, 2004). The country has a land area of 945,087 km 2 of which approximately one-third is allocated to natural protected areas (Kweka, Morrisse, & Blake, 2003). Also, Tanzania has been advocating eco-tourism as a means of enhancing conservation of its protected areas and, assisting in efforts to promote the economy and livelihoods of local people. The country's tourism policy recognises the fact that most tourist attractions lie within local communities or in their vicinities, hence it is imperative for communities in or around these areas to be fully involved in the conservation of these natural areas and to get a share of the income generated from tourism activities (Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism [MNRT], 1999). Amani Nature Reserve (ANR) in north-eastern Tanzania is an important natural area for conservation and eco-tourism. Eco-tourism activities such as bird watching, forest walks, hiking, nature photography, and observation of butterflies, primates, reptiles, and amphibians are practiced in this nature reserve. Despite the existence of long-running conservation programmes by the Government that have assisted protection, the reserve continues to be threatened by habitat loss due to fragmentation, degradation, and conversion to agriculture . Much of the early research in ANR has reported little about the success of eco-tourism in achieving conservation and development goals in the area. For example, a research work by Kingwere (2005) examined a role played by the whole concept of conserving nature in efforts to reduce poverty and guarantee improvement of rural livelihoods. However, it had limited analysis of eco-tourism as a means for livelihood improvement and conservation in the area. Mashauri (2001) wrote on the relationship between eco-tourism development in the area and community perceptions towards those developments. However, he says little about eco-tourism as a tool for providing long-term livelihood security for communities to maintain, rather than to degrade, natural resources in the course of their economic activities . We, therefore, assess whether eco-tourism is an effective tool for providing sufficient economic incentives and development opportunities for local people to value and protect biodiversity around ANR. Also, we examine how economic benefits from eco-tourism are distributed and shared among the local communities. An understanding of the ecotourism opportunities and distribution of economic benefits can assist reserve managers 76 R.A. Shoo and A.N. Songorwa and policy-makers in making more informed decisions and policies on eco-tourism management and development in ANR. Also, the study is significant due to its contribution to the understanding of the extent to which eco-tourism can yield economic benefits to local people and be used as an alternative economic strategy that is consistent with nature conservation.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":667}

The results indicate that households living closer to the KTWR are more likely to reveal negative attitude towards conservation.

The results consistently show that households with poor socioeconomic status and greater dependence on the KTWR for firewood, fodder, and raw materials are likely to possess a more negative attitude towards conservation. Poor households may not necessarily be less concerned about conservation, although institutional settings and abject poverty near protected areas appear to affect their attitudes.

The extractive reserve model has been criticized for its dependence on rubber tapping, which is no longer economically competitive. The state of Acre addressed this issue in 1999 by establishing a subsidy for rubber, designed to improve the quality of life of rubber tappers and simultaneously conserve forest. The subsidy is potentially a self-targeting and self-enforcing conservation mechanism, given that rubber production in the Amazon requires intact native forest. However, evidence on implementation of the subsidy through 2002 showed that its distribution had been fairly concentrated and correlated with ownership and sale of cattle. This raises some concerns about the use of such indirect mechanisms. The ultimate success or failure of the rubber program will depend on whether it provides a platform for more sustainable economic strategies and policies.","doi":"10.1080/10549810903543907","journal":{"name":"Journal of Sustainable Forestry Journal of Sustainable Forestry Journal of Sustainable Forestry","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":673}

J.","dAbstract":"TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING Relevant to resources management and complementary to the fields of critical nonformal adult education and environmental education, transformative learning offers a theoretical framework that attempts to provide a comprehensive theory of adult learning within different cultural contexts (Clark & Wilson, 1991; McDonald, 1999; Merriam & Caffarella, 1999; Mezirow, 2000). This framework was adopted because transformative learning theory focuses on the process of learning and accommodates the social context in which the learning occurs (Clark, 1993; Diduck, 1999; Mezirow, 2000; Sinclair & Diduck, 2001). As established below, ICE's WMAP offers nonformal opportunities for adult learning that are potentially transformative for the participants. Transformative learning centers on how to encourage learning so that an individual's perceptions and consciousness can be altered as that person is critically engaged in a process of reflection. It aims to explain the process of \" formulating more dependable beliefs about experience, assessing their contexts, seeking informed agreement on their meaning and justification, and making decisions on the resulting insights \" (Mezirow, 2000, p. 4); this process is central to the adult learning process. A goal of transformative learning is to help adults realize their potential for becoming more liberated, socially and environmentally responsible autonomous learners and to develop a more discriminating understanding of their experiences as a guide to action (Mezirow, 1995 ). This transformation in perspective and meaning making can potentially lead to conscientization, empowerment , and emancipation (Mezirow, 1981Mezirow, , 1995Mezirow, , 1996). Transformative learning occurs when individuals improve their instrumental and communicative competence and develop more functional frames of reference (Mezirow, 1995Mezirow, , 1996Mezirow, , 2000 Sinclair & Diduck, 2001). Learning occurs when there is an elaboration or transformation of existing frames of reference or when there is a creation of a new frame of reference. Transformations in frames of reference occur when there is critical reflection on the underlying assumptions of the various elements of the points of view and habits of mind through enhanced instrumental and communicative competence. Consistent with the ecological rationality of environmental adult education and relevant to this case study, transformative learning can help build environmentally sustainable societies (Finger & Asún, 2001; McDonald, 1999; Mezirow, 1995; Orr, 1994). Researchers are beginning to consider the potential for transformation through the nonformal learning that may occur with an individual's participation in environment and resource decision making. The results of this work are inconclusive. Diduck and Mitchell (2003) found that the extent to which public participation in environmental assessment facilitated the ideal conditions of learning was limited, as was the resulting learning. However, Fitzpatrick and Sinclair (2003) found that participants in an environmental hearing did engage in critical education and potentially transformative learning. Our work adds to the elaboration of the theory in this context. Because transformative learning is a theory in progress (Cranton, 2006), there are theoretical gaps that we have considered. Cranton (2006), Merriam and Caffarella (1999), and Taylor (2000) establish a number of issues with transformative theory; two are central to our research. The first, social action, suggests that individual transformation has been the focus of analysis at the expense of social change, ignoring the fact that perspective transformations may lead to social action and change. In this article, we consider whether learning is resulting in action that is causing changes, or potential changes, in the condition of the environment. The second, context, suggests there is a need to better understand what transformative learning means within a cross-cultural context and from diverse perspectives. Yershova, DeJaeghere, and Mestenhauser (2000) indicate, for example, that developing intercultural competence can trigger critical reflection. As such, we consider transformative learning within a Latin context and at the cross-cultural nexus between industry and farmers.","doi":"10.1177/0741713607309802","journal":null,"aid":674}

V. and Singh S. and Singh T. V. and Singh S. and Singh S.","dAbstract":"While the need for linking park with people was heavily stressed both at the World Conservation Strategy (1980) and the World Congress of National Parks (1982), the conflict has remained unresolved, particularly in the developing nations. The hackneyed question , who is more important – monkey or man-is still argued. Admittedly, human beings are as much a part of nature as any other animal or plant species. Indeed, it is neither desirable nor feasible to alienate poor people, living in and around parks and protected areas. Modern methods of judicious park management now point more to Integrated Conservation Development Projects (ICDP) than resorting to a traditional \" fences and fines \" approach. ICDP ensures the conservation of biological diversity by reconciling the management of park with social and economic needs of the local people, who have limited access to resources and few alternative means of livelihood. Paradoxically, these people bear substantial costs – as a result of lost access – while receiving little in return. Nanda Devi National Park in Uttaranchal (India) presents an unsavory example of people and park relationship. It is India's highest park after Kangchendzongha (Sikkim). Characterized by high altitude ecology, the park (625 sq. km) is profoundly rich in biodiversity, mountain-lores and mythologies. Indigenous communities, particularly Bhotias, have enriched the landscape by their bizarre ways of life. After Tilman and Ship-ston's successful ascent (1936) of Nanda Devi peak (7817 m), an era of mountaineering and trekking ensued which resulted in degradation of fragile Himalayan environment. Poaching of musk deer and herb smuggling also raised alarm. Considering the dire conservation needs for preserving genetic resources and diversity of species, the area was notified as a National Park in 1982. Subsequently, the park was closed for ecological quarantine. Later it was declared a Biosphere Reserve (1988) and inscribed asa World Heritage Site in 1992. Customary to Third World practices, the park emphasized a policing role excluding local people, displacing them arbitrarily with meager or little compensation for their losses of livelihood. Ban on tourism activities further added to their problem of life and living. The paper discusses the cleavage of park and people Asia and argues that development of sound ecotourism can resolve this conflict and bring park and people together.","doi":"10.1080/1094166042000199602","journal":{"name":"Pacific Journal of Tourism Research","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":675}

For members of JFM, the more important personal values were 'self governance', 'avoidance of free riding' and 'strict sanction' and the less important were 'obeying of collective decision', 'eco-conservation' and 'equal rights'. Higher and lower important institutional values in JFM partly matched with the personal values (Table 3). Barring JFM, the most important shared values were 'livelihood security from forest' and 'avoidance of free riding'. The priorities of other institutional and personal values differed in three forms of forest institutions and the hypothesis 2a was supported. step, when the confounding effects of forest types on participation were controlled, higher value congruence increased direct and indirect participation (Table 4). The results proved hypothesis 2c. When the values of the forest institution and its members were congruent and members considered the forest as central to their lives, they participated more in the forest conservation. The extent of value congruence and centrality to forest can be enhanced (as in ICFM) emphasizing local priorities , recognizing local institutions, implementing local technology, conducting regular meetings and creating awareness about institutional values. The study has certain limitations that must be acknowledged. While selecting the forest units, we adopted a purposive rather than a random sampling plan. The units selected for the study were not statistical representatives of all the forest units in eastern India. Therefore, the result should be interpreted in relative rather than absolute terms. Notwithstanding the limitations, we developed a scale, identified the values and used a semi-projective measure that can be used in similar studies on forest management.

A. and Kent S.

For centuries, Soppinabetta forests (SBFs) in the Western Ghats of India have provided essential habitat for wildlife and vital organic resources (leaf litter, green foliage) for the cultivation of betel nut palms (Areca catechu) and rice paddy (Oryza sativa). Historically, betel nut farmers carefully managed resource extraction in SBFs, but recent changes in land use policy allow for unmitigated resource extraction by site dwellers, which may imperil the traditional sustainable management of SBFs. Site dwellers live on government allotted sites and primarily derive their income through the sale of forest-based products. We used SBFs as a model system to investigate the factors governing: (i) forest resource extraction, (ii) the effect of changing agricultural practices on the rate of resource extraction, and (iii) farmers' perception of SBFs conservation in response to changes in governmental land use policy. Results from surveys of 90 households (57 farmers and 33 site-dwellers) and the forest department indicate individual farmers collected an average of 31.09 (range 0–125) metric tons of leaf litter and 19.11 metric tons (range 0–120) of green foliage per year. Organic resource harvesting by farmers was positively correlated with the size of betel nut plantations, size of SBFs, and number of livestock owned per household. Betel nut plantations require six times more compost than food grains cultivated in field paddies. In past one decade, 33% of field paddies have been converted into betel nut plantations, increasing the strain on SBFs for forest resources. Farmers believe that when they lose provisional ownership of SBFs, site dwellers unsustainably harvest resources and severely damage SBFs. We suggest that an inclusive, local-level, farmer-driven protection be implemented to preserve the SBF heritage system of Western Ghats.","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.11.006","journal":{"name":"Land Use Policy","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":678}

The paper argues that the protracted conflict between park residents and management led to new patterns of livelihood activities and household formation, and resulted in material and social differentiation amongst park households. The goals of park management, with a commitment to nature conservation and ecotourism, were at odds with the livelihood practices of park residents. Conflicts arose over stocking levels, overgrazing, wood-cutting and deforestation and over the use of other natural resources, including water and medicinal plants. The park was the site of a Rand Water project that employed many residents.

Analysis of household income, social welfare impacts and the number of people indirectly affected by ecotourism employment indicates that rural communities are moving towards an engagement with the market economy as a result of ecotourism operations. Monthly income from ecotourism employment was shown to enable households to invest in assets, education and \" luxury \" goods, which improved financial security and social welfare in remote, rural areas.

Introduction Rural African communities are largely characterised by high levels of poverty and unemployment, low levels of education and skills, and a heavy dependence on natural resources for survival (Ellis, 1999; Scherl et al., 2004). Poor, rural households rely predominantly on subsistence agriculture (Romañach et al., 2007), but growing populations and the impacts of climate change are putting severe pressure on subsistence lifestyles to sustain rural populations (Ellis, 1999). Largely due to a lack of development, skills and infrastructure, alternative livelihoods are not easily or readily available. The rural community lifestyle of families living together and sharing income and expenses often leads to high dependency ratios, with those who do find employment supporting a large number of people. The importance of permanent employment in this context becomes critical (Snyman, forthcoming). The main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ecotourism employment on rural households' total household income and their overall social welfare in rural Malawi. The study also sought to examine the flow of ecotourism income into rural villages around Liwonde National Park and to provide baseline socio-economic and demographic data for future comparative research. Land, whether for agriculture or conservation, is a scarce resource in most of southern African. This scarcity means that setting an area aside for one use implies an opportunity cost in terms of the other. From a policy perspective, escalating population growth and the resultant increase in competition for land mean that the opportunity cost of land is likely to increase (Alexander, 2000; Kideghesho et al., 2007; Browne-Nuñez & Jonker, 2008; Buckley, 2010). Sustainability is therefore likely to be an increasingly important feature of any land use. Much of Southern Africa is marginal for crop cultivation and even for extensive livestock grazing, but supports a wide range of wildlife species and is therefore suitable for wildlife tourism. In Malawi, the most pertinent issues are high population densities and few livelihood options. Ecotourism is one of few businesses able to generate income in impoverished rural areas with high unemployment levels and marginal opportunities for agriculture (Ashley & Roe, 2002; Scherl et al., 2004; Spenceley & Goodwin, 2007; Boudreaux & Nelson, 2011; Lapeyre, 2001a Lapeyre, , 2011b). In summarising the literature, De Witt et al. (2011 Witt et al. ( :1139) suggest that the key principles of ecotourism are that it should: foster a genuine interest in nature; contribute to conservation; respect and conserve local culture; make non-consumptive use of natural resources; yield benefits to the local community; and create tourist awareness of conservation and local community issues. Agrawal & Redford (2006) suggest the following two core criteria: it should generate low visitor impact and help to conserve biodiversity, and it should generate beneficial socio-economic outcomes for local people to help in poverty reduction. Based on these definitions, ecotourism in this article is taken to include activities that are nature-based and culture-based, sustainable, promote conservation and provide benefits to local people in the area. The next sections provide the theoretical framework of the research, a literature review, methods used in the study and a background to the study country of Malawi, the study area and tourism in Malawi. The specific objectives of the present study were to: . enrich the tourism and conservation literature with a quantitative analysis of the flow of ecotourism income into rural communities in Malawi; . illustrate the socio-economic impact of ecotourism employment on rural households; and . provide useful policy options and practices to enhance ecotourism benefits in remote rural areas in southern Africa. From these objectives, three research questions emerged: . Does ecotourism employment impact on rural household income and social welfare? . What are ecotourism staff in Malawi spending their salaries on (i.e. where does the ecotourism dollar go)? . What other socio-economic impacts does ecotourism have in rural areas in Malawi and how can positive impacts be maximised?","doi":"10.1080/0376835X.2013.832149","journal":null,"aid":680}

This study examined a collaborative resource management (CRM) programme at Kibale National Park (Uganda) that permits residents to fish inside the Park.

The programme's impact was empirically analysed using an 81 item personal survey, with 94 CRM fishers and 91 comparison group respondents, and additional data from semi-structured interviews and document review. Fishers' annual income was significantly greater (median = US$ 376.02 yr −1) than that of the comparison group (median = US$ 196.19 yr −1 ; p < 0.001), and their tribal affiliation influenced earnings. Fishers indicated greater support for conservation (p < 0.01) than the comparison group. Although some CRM fishers deterred illegal activity, some may extract resources illegally. This study demonstrates that CRM is a viable tool for promoting support for conservation and increasing income, although monitoring of programme participants is needed to deter illegal behaviours and sustain the resource base.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892911000403","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1118}

E. and Rahajaharison M. and Jones J. P.","dAbstract":"Despite the growing interest in conservation approaches that include payments for environmental services (PES), few evaluations of the influence of such interventions on behaviors of individuals have been conducted. We used self-reported changes in six legal and illegal forest-use behaviors to investigate the way in which a PES for biodiversity conservation intervention in Menabe, Madagascar, influenced behavior. Individuals (n = 864) from eight intervention communities and five control communities answered questions on their forest-use behaviors before and after the intervention began, as well as on their reasons for changing and their attitudes to various institutions. The payments had little impact on individuals' reported decisions to change behaviors, but it had a strong impact on individuals' attitudes. Payments appeared to legitimize monitoring of behaviors by the implementing nongovernmental organization (NGO), but did not act as a behavioral driver in their own right. Although there were no clear differences between changes in behaviors in the intervention and control communities, the intervention did influence motivations for change. Fear of local forest associations and the implementing NGO were strong motivators for changing behavior in communities with the PES intervention, whereas fear of the national government was the main reason given for change in control communities. Behavioral changes were most stable where fear of local organizations motivated the change. Our results highlight the interactions between different incentives people face when making behavioral decisions and the importance of considering the full range of incentives when designing community-based PES interventions. Resumen: No obstante el creciente interés en los enfoques de conservación que incluyen pagos por servicios ambientales (PSA), se han realizado pocas evaluaciones de la influencia de tales intervenciones sobre los individuos. Utilizamos cambios auto reportados en seis conductas legales e ilegales de uso del bosque para investigar la manera en que un PSA para la conservación de biodiversidad influyó en la conducta en Menabe, Madagascar. Individuos (n = 864) de ocho comunidades con intervención y cinco comunidades control respondieron preguntas sobre su conducta antes y después de que comenzara la intervención, así como las razones del cambio y sus actitudes ante varias instituciones. Los pagos tuvieron poco impacto sobre las decisiones de cambio de actitudes de los individuos, pero tuvieron un fuerte impacto sobre las actitudes de los individuos. Los pagos aparentemente legitimizaron el monitoreo de conductas por la organización no 1489 gubernamental (ONG) que los implementó, pero no actuaron como un factor conductual por sí solos. Aunque no hubo diferencias claras entre los cambios de conducta en las comunidades control y con intervención, la intervención influyó en las motivaciones para cambiar. El temor a las asociaciones forestales locales y a la ONG fueron motivos fuertes para el cambio de conducta en las comunidades con intervención de PSA, mientras que el temor al gobierno nacional fue la razón principal del cambio en las comunidades control. Los cambios conductuales fueron más estables donde el temor a las organizaciones locales fue el motivo del cambio. Nuestros resultados resaltan las interacciones entre diferentes incentivos que la gente enfrenta cuando toma decisiones conductuales, así como la importancia de considerar todo el rango de incentivos cuando se diseñan intervenciones de PSA basados en comunidades.","doi":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01526.x","journal":{"name":"Conservation Biology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1119}

Learning outcomes attributable to the CBEA process included technical skills for erosion control, new information about environmental assessment (EA) regulations and shared values of environmental sustainability and community unity. An application of selected best practice approaches in a test case, in order to encourage greater participation and learning, had mixed success. For example, attempts at providing early notice still resulted in it being far too late for most participants and only about one-third of the participants were women.

Incentive-based programs (IBPs) have become a favored approach to protected area management, geared at fostering local stewardship by delivering benefits tied to conservation to local people. Effective IBPs require benefits to accrue to and be recognized by those experiencing the greatest consequences as a result of the protected area, and those likely to continue extractive activities if their livelihood needs are compromised. This research examines dispersal of IBP benefits, as perceived by local residents in Nepal's Annapurna Conservation Area. Results reported here are based on questionnaire interviews with 188 households conducted between September and December 2004. Results indicate that local residents primarily identify benefits from social development activities, provisions for resource extraction, and economic opportunities. Overall, benefits have been dispersed equally to households in villages on and off the main tourist route, and regardless of a household's participation in tourism. However, benefits are not effectively targeted to poorer residents, those highly dependent on natural resources, and those experiencing the most crop damage and livestock loss from protected wildlife. This article provides several suggestions for improving the delivery of conservation incentives.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-008-9130-6","journal":null,"aid":683}

Benefits can generate incentives to encourage conservation support; however, such incentive-based programmes (IBPs) have been criticized owing to their inability to provide equal and equitable distribution of benefits. This research examines the distribution of IBPs in the buffer zone of Nepal's Chitwan National Park (CNP). Questionnaire interview data indicate the livelihoods of buffer zone residents remain strained by conservation activities. While benefits under IBPs are recognized by the residents, villages distant from the main tourist entry points to the park where costs associated with conservation are highest recognize few benefits. An individual's level of participation in tourism also affects the benefits received, with those directly employed in tourism receiving the most benefit. Despite the discrepancy in benefit distribution between villages and between levels of involvement in tourism, CNP is making progress in distributing benefits beyond villages where tourism is concentrated. The main IBP flaw in CNP is a limited ability to replicate benefits throughout the buffer zone, providing similar levels of benefit to all villages.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892908004451","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":682}

J. and Wiryawan B. and Bengen D. G. and Febriamansyah R. and Haluan J.","dAbstract":"Despite a raft of livelihood programs designed to help Indonesian small-scale fishers there are concerns that the needs of the poor are still not being addressed. This study examines this concern through a two-pronged approach. Firstly, through a broad-scale series of interviews with fishers, community leaders and government employees in 25 fishing villages in the province of West Sumatra to identify which sectors of the fishing industry the poor operate in and the types of livelihood initiatives targeted at helping them. Secondly, by using three case studies of livelihood development projects and identifying the social, economic and institutional lessons learned that point both to best and worst practice. Three groups of poor fishers were identified; a large group of non-boat owning \" labourers \" , a group of \" small-scale boat owners \" and a small group of \" processors and sellers \". Empowerment programs by the Department for Fisheries between 2005 and 2009 emphasised improving physical capital through providing fishing gear, motorisation and processing equipment. These initiatives could potentially help small-boat owners but would not benefit non-boat owning labourers. The new livelihood improvement programme GPEMP had non-fishing alternative livelihoods that could help labourers, but still demonstrated an ongoing bias towards physical capital interventions. The three case studies demonstrated that aspects of leadership, trust, advocacy, administration, accountability and ongoing institutional support are key elements of empowering coastal communities towards livelihood improvement. Human and social capital components need prioritisation in future poverty alleviation policy and programs in Indonesia, particularly for the large marginalised group of labourers.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2013.11.013","journal":null,"aid":684}

These approaches generally account for park neighbors as more than just potential violators of park regulations (e.g., recreational users, partners for conservation, candidates for conservation and/or development projects, or targets for environmental education initiatives). Such approaches have come about for a number of reasons. In addition to widespread conflicts between dispossessed people and park guards, shortcomings in protectionist strategies have been compounded in many places by a lack of resources and/or political will for successfully enforcing park regulations (Dourojeanni, 2002; Salafsky & Margoluis, 2002). At the same time these strategies were failing, a new consciousness was developing within the conservation community that more powerfully acknowledged the rights of local populations (Hough, 1988; Alcorn, 1993; Strum, 1994; Stevens, 1997a; Brechin, Wilshusen, Fortwangler, & West, 2002), their political power (Anderson, 1995), and the positive impacts that local populations could have upon biological diversity through traditional land-use practices (Alcorn, 1993; Fairhead & Leach, 1996), the application of local ecological knowledge (McNeely, 1989; Alcorn, 1993; Chambers, 1994; Kellert, 1996), collaboration in conservation projects (Western, 1994; Stevens, 1997b; Evans & Birchenough, 2001; Zimmerman, Peres, Malcolm, & Turner, 2001), and local tendencies to defend their territories against outside encroachment (Schwartzmann, Nepstad, & Moreira, 2000; Fearnside, 2003 ). A new focus stressing the interconnections between the landscapes within protected areas and those outside their borders also called into question traditional inward-looking approaches to park management (Metcalfe, 1995; IUCN, 2003). Thus, as strict protectionist approaches were proving both operationally and morally questionable, it made sense to pursue new strategies for building positive relationships with the people living closest to the resources. These strategies can largely be categorized as falling within one or both of two paradigms: a dominant paradigm based upon economic rationality, as exemplified by Garret Hardin's classic 1968 Tragedy of the Commons article, and the other still emerging, based largely upon the moral principles of democracy and human rights. Hardin's paradigm of economic rationality suggests that people will inevitably deplete resources that are not privately owned through a seemingly logical argument of self-interest. Because the benefits of exploiting such systems accrue individually while the costs are spread over the whole population, it makes perfect economic sense for each user to exploit as much as possible, leading to the overall degradation of the resource as all users make the same decision. The paradigm espouses that people are purely economic beings, acting to maximize their own individual take of commonly owned or open access resources (e.g., forests or pastures). It can be easily applied to park situations as well. Employing this logic, the 1980s witnessed the development of the integrated-conservation-and-development project (ICDP) concept, which posited that alternative sources of income could supplant local desires for exploiting protected resources. These projects varied in scope from aiming to provide alternative livelihoods for local residents whose access had been restricted to traditionally available resources to offering economic or development incentives in exchange for local agreements to halt exploitative practices. Numerous evaluations of ICDPs in the 1990s and beyond have revealed that they have largely failed at their task of deflecting pressures from and building local support for protected areas ( Oates, 1999; Brown, 2002; van Schaik & Rijksen, 2002;). Many have cited these particular failures as grounds for returning to purely protectionist strategies of strict enforcement in and around protected areas (Robinson, 1993; Terborgh, van Schaik, Davenport, & Rao, 2002). Rather than questioning the basic premise of the paradigm that brought about ICDPs, the arguments of these particular critics have remained within it, suggesting that ICDPs are inherently flawed because they require unrealistic voluntary restraint on behalf of their participants (Rabinowitz, 1999; Terborgh, 1999; van Schaik & Rijksen, 2002). In other words, ICDPs do not adequately account for individuals' desires to maximize their take of the resource. Other economic rationalists have suggested that the incentives offered have not been large enough to outweigh the opportunity costs of foregoing natural resource exploitation within parks, or alternatively that benefits have not been directly linked to halting extractive practices, failing to provide a sustainable either/or ultimatum for local actors ( Fisher, 2001; Brandon, 2002 ). These critics have commonly argued for reexamining the types of incentives offered. Still others have focused upon improving distribution and/or marketing of such benefits (Ferraro, 2001; Ferraro & Kiss, 2002; Wells, McShane, Dublin, O'Connor, & Redford, 2004). Meanwhile, others hypothesized that the real reasons for the failures of ICDPs were that assumptions about people as purely economic actors might not be entirely true. Some have suggested that ICDPs have failed most often in cases where local residents have not been allowed to participate adequately or equitably in their formulation (Belsky, 1999; Brown, 2002; Mahanty, 2002). Most of these critiques fall within the paradigm of democracy and human rights. The subscribers to this paradigm have most commonly advocated for a continued focus upon ICDPs as well as other people-oriented approaches to conservation, often arguing for more inclusive and locally empowering participatory schemes (e.g., Pimbert & Pretty, 1995; Kothari, Vania, Das, Christopher, & Jha, 1997; Buck, Geisler, Schelhas, & Wollenberg, 2001; Borrini-Feyerabend, 2003). These arguments have led to an expansion of local protected areas outreach strategies to incorporate a wide array of people-oriented approaches, ranging from environmental education and social marketing schemes aimed at local publics (Zube, 1995; Ham & Krumpe, 1996; Infield & Namara, 2001) to comanagement of parks with local residents (Venter & Breen, 1998; Lane, 2001). Results of these other people-oriented strategies have also been rather mixed, without much scientific explanation for the reasons behind varying levels of success. Those in favor of continuing people-oriented approaches continue to advocate for more locally empowering participatory schemes or more incentives-based approaches. Those arguing for more authoritarian protection most commonly invoke arguments espousing that local participation and/or negotiation is unnecessary and potentially damaging, based upon the premise that voluntary compliance with conservation objectives, even in exchange for compensation or other benefits, is unlikely among the rural poor who often live near park borders. While published empirical research has uncovered relationships that support each of these standpoints, little work has been done to scientifically compare them. The paradigmatic lens of the researcher tends to selectively include or exclude the variables upon which their research focuses. Members of each camp (people-oriented versus protectionist, human rights versus economic rationalist) thus draw conclusions from valid correlations within their data, but fail to rule out the explanations of the other. The research described herein tests theory that goes beyond the either/ or dichotomy of today's debates between the classic paradigm of economic rationality and that proposed by those demanding more democratic engagement of local actors. The one thing it seems that each group could agree upon is that the sustainability of protected areas relies heavily upon their abilities to broker positive, or at least benign, relationships with local populations . Thus, this research asks the questions: What makes people react in the ways they do to protected areas?; Is it really just about economics?; Is it about empowerment and participation as well?; Are there other factors involved? BEYOND ECONOMIC RATIONALITY: A PREMISE FOR STUDY Numerous critiques of the Tragedy of the Commons (TOC) worldview have been published (Peters, 1987; Berkes, Feeny, McKay, & Acheson, 1989; Ostrom, 1990). Most point to the fact that individuals do not act entirely independently of other individuals. Components of decision-making theory often overlooked by economic theorists typically include those of social pressures and differential power arrangements that prohibit, inhibit, encourage , or mandate individual actions. Walter Firey, in his seminal work Man, Mind, and Land; for example, points out that real-world resource systems throughout history have always contained aspects that are not economically gainful to users. This is largely due to the fact that people are influenced by each other in non-economic ways through formal and informal contracts of reciprocity, trust, and acting for the good of the group (Firey, 1960). The Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1988Ajzen, , 2002) goes further to suggest that individuals base their decisions to act not only upon cost-benefits assessments and perceptions about the attitudes of their peers, but also upon the relative amount of control they themselves believe they have over the actions they might carry out. In the context of local residents formulating responses to parks, these control assessments can be influenced by perceptions about the enforcement of park regulations as well as perceptions about the receptiveness of park managers to local input. Other researchers suggest that the environmental values of individuals are also likely to influence their reactions to protected areas, in particular, their values regarding appropriate forms of land use and stewardship (Kellert, 1996; Clark, 2002). This research set out to gauge the relative importance of each of these types of evaluations made by local residents (cost-benefits analyses, assessments of local empowerment/participation, perceptions about park enforcement, perceptions about the attitudes of peers, levels of trust for park managers, and value judgments about environmental protection) in influencing their reactions to neighboring protected areas. By doing so in widely varying contexts, it sheds some light on why certain strategies for interaction with local populations tend to fail or succeed under different conditions, incorporating both rational/economic and more process-related variables.

Community fishers have restricted access to marine resources because marine state agencies claim that the sustainability of the fish stock is under threat. However, the primary contributors to the depletion are outside fishing vessels. Instead of restricting marginalized fishers' access to marine resources, they should be empowered to monitor the fish trade themselves in order to reduce illegal poaching, which will in turn help the fish stock return to sustainable levels and provide for the livelihoods of marginalized fishers.","doi":"10.1080/19376812.2012.723188","journal":null,"aid":1125}

Contingent valuation technique is utilized to measure the economic value of perceived benefits of mangroves. Results indicate that each user group would be willing to make substantial contribution of labor and/or cash each year, apparently for different reasons. The perception that mangrove contributes to fish nursery is the strongest reason fishermen take part in restoration. That mangrove serves as an alternative source of income for the whole community influences fisherwomen's decision to participate. Surprisingly, only a minority of rice farmers would be willing to contribute to mangrove restoration, yet at a higher annual median level than the other two groups.

Several studies have quantified local people's use of protected areas and estimated the value of such areas to them. However, few studies incorporate economic analyses to investigate the effect of management interventions on local communities' resource use and collection behaviour. In Nepal, buffer zones and especially buffer zone community forestry are seen as means to define and demarcate places, where local people may legally extract goods that are either identical to or relevant substitutes for products that are collected in protected areas. The intention is to resolve park-people conflicts over resource use. This article presents the findings of an in-depth study of the importance of natural resources to the livelihoods of 18 households. One village was located inside RCNP with no realistic alternatives to Park resources, while the other is located in the buffer zone with equal distance to the Park, a national forest and their community forest. For each household, the collection of products, allocation of time, and purchase and sale of goods were recorded daily through 12 consecutive months and economic values were calculated on the basis of local market prices and recorded quantities. The study shows that products from RCNP are of great importance to the livelihoods of local people. Furthermore, we find that products collected in the national forest substitute products from the Park, while the substitution effect of the community forest is small. Accordingly, the study illustrates that, irrespective of buffer zone community forestry, there is still a gap between local people's need for supplementing natural resources and their rights to satisfy them on a legal basis, which is likely to be unsustainable in the longer term. This calls for a thorough evaluation of actual park-people relations and how these may be improved through local participation that goes beyond the current form of buffer zone community forestry and the admitted 7–14 annual days of open access grass cutting within the park. q","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2005.03.017","journal":null,"aid":687}

The purpose of this study was to analyse effects of ecotourism on natural resource use and livelihoods in an indigenous community of 80 families in Peru. Household interviews and participant observation were used to track social and economic changes in the community as it partnered with a private tour company to build and co-manage an ecotourism lodge. Effects of eco-tourism were measured among the same households before and after the lodge opened, and between households with varying levels of participation. The hypothesis that economic benefits from ecotourism would provide incentives for people to alter their livelihoods and change their uses of natural resources was tested. Results showed that ecotourism effects were ambiguous. Though employment led to a general decline in farming and hunting, new income enabled greater market consumption and expansion of production. Ecotourism also prompted sentiments not easily measured in economic analyses alone, including willingness to be involved in ecotourism work, despite relatively minimal economic returns. These findings are a reflection of the fact that ecotourism is not merely an economic 'tool' for conservation, but also the cause of new values and social relations.","doi":"10.2167/joe177.0","journal":{"name":"A.

{"filename":"Sudtongkong and Webb 2008","year":2008,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION The environmental importance of mangroves has been widely demonstrated (e.g., Othman 1994, Nagelkerken et al. 2000, Kathiresan and Rajendran 2005), as has their direct and indirect contributions to the livelihoods of millions of coastal inhabitants (Sathirathai and Barbier 2001, Soontornwong 2006). Unfortunately, however, mangroves are seriously threatened ecosystems (Valiela et al. 2001), with threats coming from coastal development, conversion to aquaculture, overharvesting of trees, pollution, and global climate change (Adeel and Pomeroy 2002, Alongi 2002). Southeast Asia is considered to be a center of mangrove diversity (Tomlinson 1986); therefore, conservation of Southeast Asian mangroves is a high priority. There is an urgent need to find conservation strategies that lead to successful biological outcomes, while accounting for the needs of rural coastal inhabitants who depend on the resource. There is extensive documentation that in many upland systems of South and Southeast Asia, local forest protection and management has led to an improvement of forest conditions (e.g., Agrawal and Ostrom 2001, Gautam et al. 2002, Kabir and Webb 2006). This has led to a shift in policies and action toward decentralization and local management (Webb 2008). In contrast, surprisingly little is known about the impacts of community management on coastal mangrove forests, with the exception of the Philippines, where communitybased coastal management projects have existed for http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol13/iss2/art27/ more than 20 years (Pomeroy and Carlos 1997, Alcala 1998, Katon et al. 2000, Walters 2000, 2003). Indeed, it has been recognized for some time that community-based coastal management shows promise, but its integration into national management systems would require significant effort on the part of governments to reorient legal and policy instruments to include local communities (Pomeroy 1995). In Thailand, mangrove forests are claimed and managed by the state (Aksornkoae 2004). The central government centralized and monopolized the control and management of natural resources together with the process of territorialization (Ganjanapan 2003, Webb 2008). Subsequently, mangroves were put under strict control by the state agencies, and settlement or forest utilization by local people in mangrove conservation zones is prohibited (Aksornkoae 2004). Early assessments of coastal management policy for Thailand failed to recognize the potential of communities in the process (Tabucanon 1991). State mangrove forest management can occur without the participation of local people, which not surprisingly has declined since the government claimed control and management of natural resources (Ganjanapan 2003). Past failings of state management are reflected in the decline in mangrove area from 372 448 ha in 1960 to between 167 500 and 244 000 ha in the late 1990s (Wilkie and Fortuna 2003). In southern Thailand, degradation of mangroves has prompted many communities to initiate local organization and collective action for mangrove conservation (Rittibhonbhun et al. 1993), and coastal communities are interested in gaining rights to mangroves under a community forestry umbrella (Sathirathai 1997). However, skepticism persists— particularly within Thai government circles—about the capacity of local people to sustainably manage and protect mangrove forests. Research on the effects of different management models on mangrove ecosystems will inform the current debate, but to date no research has assessed the effectiveness local community management of mangroves in Thailand. How can community management of mangroves be assessed for conservation outcomes? Quantitative surveys can report biological outcomes, but when the resource is managed by local communities, social data are also needed, to explore the contextual factors associated with those outcomes. For mangroves, this has yet to be accomplished, although in upland forested systems interdisciplinary studies are becoming more common (Kijtewachakul et al. 2004, Gautam and Shivakoti 2005). Here we present a case study of four mangrove forests under two management systems: state management and community management. We used a combination of methods to evaluate the relative conservation outcomes of state and community management on the mangrove forests of Trang Province, southern Thailand. This paper presents not only an evaluation of these two management systems in Thailand, but also serves as an example of how interdisciplinary research can be performed in coastal systems of the tropics. State forest refers to mangrove forests owned and managed by the state, where communities have limited or no rights to access, withdraw, or manage resources. Community forest management refers to a system where a locally derived formal governance structure has been developed to manage, protect, and use the forest resources. The objective of the study was to compare the conditions of the mangrove ecosystem under community and state management. We report that, in our study area, local communities have been effective stewards of mangrove forests. The findings of this research will be useful for developing mangrove management using community-based approaches.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":690}

Hardin (1968) has called this phenomenon the \" tragedy of open-access resources. \" 1 The open-access problem occurs due to the absence of incentives for anyone to conserve those resources for long-term use, since if they do then others will simply use more. For this reason, as Ostrom (1990) has illustrated, the tragedy of open-access resources often translates to \" prisoners' dilemmas \" (Luce and Raiffa 1957). The CBNRM adopts a mixture of rights-and incentives-based approaches to address prisoners' dilemmas. The establishment of well-defined property rights is a conventional institutional arrangement for society to tackle resource overexploitation caused by open access (Coase 1960). Financial incentives or disincentives can also be effective measures because resource users are expected to make rational decisions in response to the measures and eventually alter their behavior of overexploitation. In contrast, commandand-control approaches are often criticized as infeasible or undesirable in mandating human economic behaviors because \" top-down \" regulation tends to be heavy handed and to construct people as villains. There are three types of property rights regimes in the resource management arena (Feeny et al. 1990; Ostrom 1990): state property, communal property, and private property regimes. State property (e.g., state forest) is owned and managed by the government. Communal property (e.g., inshore fisheries) refers to that which is exclusively accessible to a community or an identifiable group. Communal property rights stipulate what a community may or may not do with the resources to which the community has access and the extent to which the community may possess, use, transform, bequeath, transfer, or exclude others from its property. Under private property, rights to the resources are vested in private agents. Private property rights are usually stronger than communal property rights in terms of transferability and duration. An intentional CBNRM scheme is to turn open-access resources into communal properties: that is, a bundle of legally defined property rights is presented to a specific community as an incentive for the community to be able and willing to achieve desired natural resource management outcomes. From her case studies of traditional CBNRM, Ostrom (1990, 90) has summed up seven key elements of any exemplary community-based resource institution. These key elements are: As Ostrom (1990) has elaborated, clearly defining the rights to communal property is the first step to making a successful CBNRM case. When the boundaries of property rights are blurred, the community remains uncertain as to what their rights and responsibilities are and what is managed for whom. Facing a risk that outsiders can reap any benefits that they generate by their own efforts, the community will not be motivated to engage in collective action in the first place. The importance of the congruence of the property rights with the needs of the local community should also be kept in perspective. In the context of CBNRM, this means that the communal rights should be strong enough to compensate for the opportunity costs of protecting and managing natural resources. Last but not the least is the proper recognition of the right to organize among participants. CBNRM is based on the notion that local communities have a greater interest in the sustainable use of their surrounding natural resources than government-appointed officials, and that they have the knowledge of local ecosystems that allows them to manage the resources well. Thus, decentralized resource management and bottom-up decision making are at the core of CBNRM. With a lack of autonomy, any CBNRM scheme could end up being nothing but a hybrid of \" commandand-control \" natural resource management policy.","doi":"10.1353/phs.2012.0038","journal":null,"aid":691}

However, incentives cannot work if people do not know about them, if they are inappropriate or if they are delivered in insufficient quantities. In southern African CBNRM initiatives, many incentives are offered, particularly jobs and community income from hunting and photographic tourism activities. There is a need to assess – jointly – residents' knowledge and perceptions of these incentives and their actual delivery to determine whether they are likely to be effective in sustaining participation in CBNRM activities over the long run. This paper reports the results of just such an assessment at two CBNRM sites, the Tchuma Tchato project in Mozambique and Kwandu Conservancy in Namibia. While different types of benefits were delivered at both sites, they were largely of low value and low in volume. It appears that the incentives offered are not inappropriate, but are insufficient – too few people benefit directly and the level of benefits is generally too small. Further, a large minority of households feel benefits have been inequitably distributed and that the direct costs of living with wildlife have been ineffectively addressed. These issues should be viewed as potentially serious challenges to maintaining local participation in CBNRM activities in the long run.","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.08.008","journal":{"name":"Land Use Policy","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":692}

A recent study in Lampung in the province of Sumatra, Indonesia revealed that, even with the use of military force, forest policy and management has largely failed to protect forest resources when local communities were not involved. In contrast, with less government intervention but more secure land rights (as perceived by farmers), local communities have successfully rehabilitated degraded land, including that designated as state forest area, through establishment of coffee based agroforestry. The main incentive for local communities to manage land more sustainably was the expectation of secure land rights on state forest land through which livelihood and income could be realized. The study indicated that under such circumstances there is room for negotiation between the government forestry department and local communities to better manage state forest land. This not only can generate income for local communities but can also improve the overall environment through reduction of fire incidence. This indicates that legal land use rights for local communities on state forest land could be used as a 'reward' for upland farmers for their role in maintaining environmental services of forest land.","doi":"10.1007/s11258-004-1413-2","journal":null,"aid":1135}

In these places, community participation is the key to successful conservation programs intended to rehabilitate environmental functions and produce environmental services for beneficiaries outside the area. This paper reviews the relationship between poverty and environmental services and briefly discusses the main ways in which approaches that rely on payment for environmental services are thought likely to alleviate poverty. It also discusses the poverty profile and inequality of upland dwellers in the Sumberjaya watershed in Indonesia's Lampung Province, using income, education, and land-holding indicators. Data related to these three indicators were collected from intensive household surveys and interviews and used via Gini decomposition to measure inequality. In addition, analysis of data on stem at breast height and horizontal root diameter of coffee and other noncoffee trees planted on coffee farms showed that index of root shallowness could be used as an estimator of environmental services. This study revealed that state forest land in Lampung Province, Indonesia, not only provides important income for poor farmers but also leads to a more equitable distribution of income and land holdings. These farmers have also successfully rehabilitated degraded land by establishing coffee-based agroforestry. As found in other recent studies, these findings show that coffee-based agroforestry can perform watershed service functions similar to those of natural, undisturbed forests. This supports the argument that poor farmers who provide environmental services through their activities in state-owned forests should be rewarded with land rights as a policy to alleviate poverty.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":696}

For most coastal areas the strengthening of customary marine tenure, rules and regulations should yield even greater biodiversity and livelihood benefits. Here, we present the conservation planning results from a locally-managed marine area programme initiated by the Government of Aceh, Indonesia, which aimed to empower coastal communities to sustainably and equitably manage marine resources with local government. In 2008 the government established a Marine and Fisheries Task Force to identify priority areas for marine biodiversity (through systematic conservation planning) and coastal communities (through participatory planning). In addition to the existing 264,788 ha of marine management units, systematic planning identified another 53,372 ha. However, the subsequent stakeholder participation phase, involving intensive local consultations, further expanded the locally-managed marine area network by 6,725 ha and to a total of 23 locally-managed marine areas. This combined approach had additional benefits because it generated a strong sense of local ownership. For communities it initiated a process for recognizing their customary claimed areas and resolved overlapping boundaries between neighbouring communities, thereby reducing the likelihood of future conflicts over natural resource use. For government, it provided the basis of a robust governance system, with 34 new or revised decrees being completed and an additional USD 1.6 million being allocated for implementation of locally-managed marine areas. This particip-atory approach should considerably increase the successful delivery of a sustainable and equitable locally-managed marine area network for Aceh, which has wide application for the Southeast Asian region and beyond.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605312000166","journal":null,"aid":1137}

Effective management of tree resources requires, among other things, knowledge of which species are preferred locally and can therefore be successfully adopted into conservation plans, as well as an understanding of local attitudes towards tree conservation. We conducted a study in Nawaikoke Sub-county of eastern Uganda to address three questions: (1) Which woody species are considered most valuable to rural communities and how do priorities vary across different sectors of the communities? (2) What are local perceptions of the status of woody species and of the main threats to their conservation? (3) What attitudes do local people hold towards conservation and what challenges do conservation initiatives face? We carried out focus group discussions with different specialist groups, key informant interviews, and semi-structured interviews with 62 households. Our results illustrate that local communities value 26 woody species highly, 15 of which are indigenous. However, priorities vary greatly across different specialist user groups. According to respondents most of the prioritized species are threatened, with the greatest threats being charcoal burning, overexploitation and expanding agriculture. Community members are actively managing and/or interested in managing those tree resources with economic value but largely ignore the greater diversity of woody species, especially shrubs. Administrative, political and traditional leadership institutions do not currently assist in the conservation of woody species. We provide suggestions for a conservation action plan that involves multiple strategies.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605309001847","journal":null,"aid":698}

Distributive mechanisms to share REDDþ income at the local scale are integral to the equity and effectiveness of REDDþ, as evidenced for example by the draft guidelines on REDDþ Social and Environmental Standards. 1 Payments for environmental services (PES) schemes could be used within REDDþ programs to link national-level REDDþ payments to subnational resource management activities (Wunder 2009) and to provide incentives to conserve and enhance carbon stocks. PES schemes are supposed to provide direct payments conditional on the provision of a specified environmental service (Tacconi 2012 ). PES schemes have been implemented in developing countries since the 1990s following many fraught attempts at providing indirect incentives to stem the loss of biodiversity (Ferraro and Kiss 2002). The conditionality of PES (i.e., disbursing payments only if the environmental service is provided) differentiates it from these earlier approaches, where benefits were only indirectly linked to the conservation of specific habitats or provision of services. The potential use of PES as a distributive mechanism for REDDþ calls, therefore , for a clear understanding of the livelihood impacts of existing PES schemes so that critical lessons can inform the development of REDDþ mechanisms and guidelines . There is an urgent need to learn from past and present PES schemes, particularly given concerns about how such initiatives might impact the rights and livelihoods of local resource users and managers. Engel et al. (2008) noted the need to understand how PES schemes affect the poor, given the limited empirical evidence on livelihood impacts. The overlap between the environmental services targeted by PES schemes and areas of high poverty incidence also points to the need to consider the livelihood impacts of PES schemes (e.g., Grieg-Gran et al. 2005; Pagiola et al. 2005; Engel et al. 2008), which are clearly relevant for REDDþ. This article contributes to filling this knowledge gap and derives implications for the design of REDDþ activities. The article addresses the following questions drawing on seven PES cases in Africa, Asia, and Latin America: . What have been the impacts of PES schemes on livelihoods? .

A study was carried out in 18 locations in the Nandi North, Nandi South and Nandi Hills districts of Kenya, which cover the Nandi Hills and Nandi Forests in Nandi County, major water catchments for Lake Victoria. A mixed methodological approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data obtained from focus group discussions, key informant interviews, household survey and observations was embraced in data collection and analysis. The study reveals that there are several strategies that have been adopted by the local population and institutions involved in the management of the Nandi Hills Forests (NHFs) and that these strategies have contributed to an improvement in the perceptions of the local population in terms of the importance of environmental management of the forests. This paper highlights EE as a vehicle for ensuring a sustainable management of the Nandi Hills Forests. As such, it illuminates the great potential that lies in sustainably managing the NHFs by integrating formal and informal EE approaches. It further points out the functional gaps in the management of NHFs and proposes best-practices that could be adopted and/or domesticated in NHFs management regimes.","doi":"10.1007/s11632-013-0203-0","journal":{"name":"For.

The cornerstone of CAMPFIRE is the right to manage, use, dispose of, and benefit from these resources. Between 1989 and 2006, CAMPFIRE income, mostly from high valued safari hunting, totalled nearly USD$ 30 million, of which 52% was allocated to sub-district wards and villages for community projects and household benefits. Whilst a number of assumptions underlying the success of CAMPFIRE as an innovative model for CBNRM have yet to be met, CAMPFIRE confirms the concept that devolving responsibility and accountability for natural resource management can be highly effective for the collective and participatory management of such resources. Elephant numbers in CAMPFIRE areas have increased and buffalo numbers are either stable or decreased slightly during the life of the programme. However, offtake quotas for these two species have increased with a concomitant decline in trophy quality. Although the amount of wildlife habitat diminished after 1980, following the commencement of CAMPFIRE the rate of habitat loss slowed down and in some specific instances was even reversed. More recently there has been increased pressure on habitats and other natural resources as a consequence of deteriorating socioeconomic conditions in the country. Where devolution has been successful, promising results have been achieved and the recent acceptance and implementation of direct payments to communities is probably the most significant development since 2000. That this has happened can be attributed to CAMPFIRE enabling communities to maximize their roles within the existing set of rules, and by so doing, allowing these rules to be challenged.

{"filename":"Terk 2010","year":2010,"title":"Biodiversity The role of SCUBA diver user fees as a source of sustainable funding for coral reef marine Protected areas","authors":"Terk E. and Knowlton N.","dAbstract":"Elizabeth Terk 1 and Nancy Knowlton 1, 2 Abstract. Coral reefs are both highly diverse and economically important. Human activities, however, threaten the world's coral reefs, endangering their biological and economic value. No take Marine Protected Areas (MPA), which ban fishing within MPA boundaries, help conserve and restore reef health and provide ecological resilience to reefs in the face of global warming and ocean acidification. In many cases, cost-benefit analyses have provided strong support for the establishment of protected areas, but insufficient funding is often the largest obstacle to successful MPA implementation. SCUBA diving tourism is one method for financing coral reef conservation. Creating employment opportunities in the tourist industry provides an alternative to destructive fishing methods for the local community, and diver user fees can also be used to directly fund MPA management. While diver fees are a successful source of funding for some MPAs, more often than not, no fees are collected or the fees collected are inadequate to cover the costs of managing an MPA. This paper compares current user fees charged for diving in Caribbean MPAs and compares the fees to what tourists pay to reach their destination, for hotel rooms and other amenities. Fewer than one quarter of MPAs charged fees. Whhen charged, the fees were, on average, well below likely willingness-to-pay levels. Fees were more likely to be charged when NGOs were involved with MPA management. Key words: coral reefs, marine protected areas, SCUBA diving tourism, Caribbean MPAs along the Pacific coast of Central America take place in MPAs (Green and Donelly 2003). SCUBA diver user fees are also easier to enforce because in most locations divers need to purchase compressed air for shore dives or dive with a local dive shop, providing a point of contact to collect fees (Thur 2009). Creating employment opportunities in the tourist industry can provide an alternative to destructive fishing methods for the local community, and diver user fees can directly fund MPA management. For this reason we focused on diver user fees in this study. Several willingness-to-pay (WTP) studies have been carried out to improve the practice of collecting user fees as a means to fund MPAs. A meta-analysis of studies of WTP for marine park entry by Peters and hawkins (2009) found an overwhelming public approval of payment for entry to marine parks. Although this analysis was not limited to divers and concerned entry fees rather than activity fees, there is no reason to expect a priori that divers would be substantially less supportive of paying for the ability to dive in MPAs. Most studies showed general acceptance of the introduction of fees or a fee increase where charges already existed. Reasons for acceptance were influenced by visitor's income, level of education, environmental awareness, residency and desire to provide a legacy for future generations. The majority of these studies also showed that the mean WTP was significantly higher than the fee charged at the time of the survey. Peters and hawkins (2009) suggest that user fees offer MPAs real opportunities for substantial revenue generation. Unfortunately, the majority of user fee systems have failed to provide enough funds to fully fund MPAs because the fees charged are too low (Dharmaratne et al. 2000). To date, most studies have focused on specific MPAs rather than assessing fees across a region. To address this, we conducted a study of MPAs in the wider Caribbean as defined above. This study covered 38 countries and territories (See Table 1 for complete list). The goal was to determine the relationship between the cost of what divers are paying for various travel expenses and user fees for MPAs. In the Caribbean, coral reefs offer significant economic benefits, including tourism-related benefits. Coral reef fisheries provide an important source of protein to millions of people in the Caribbean region, are a staple food of tourists, and are a valuable export commodity. however, the most important economic sector in this region is tourism. About $105 billion is contributed to the Caribbean economy annually by tourism, and one in six Caribbean workers are employed in the tourism industry (CEP 2010).","doi":"10.1080/14888386.2010.9712651","journal":null,"aid":701}

Terms & Conditions of access and use can be found at http://www.tandfonline.com/page/terms- and-conditions Understanding relationships between local people and natural resources is critical in designing and sustaining effective conservation strategies. Such relationships have particular relevance to the management of protected areas (PAs), where long-standing tensions over land tenure, local use of natural resources, and human–wildlife conflicts may limit local acceptance of conservation goals (Newmark and Leonard 1991; Newmark et al. 1994; Lilieholm and Romney 2000; Whitesell et al. 2002; Balint 2006). In Africa, many PAs were established under colonial rule to allow European colonists access to an unspoiled ''Eden'' no longer found at home (Anderson and Grove 1987; Neumann 1998). The Convention for the Preservation of Animals (1900) and the London Convention for the African States (1933) formed the basis for most wildlife policies in Anglophone Africa (Lyster 1985). These laws, however, failed to consider traditional resource uses or the need for local support in sustaining conservation. Even after African nations gained independence in the 1960s, many maintained these colonial-era policies while expanding PA networks—actions taken despite growing evidence of the adverse impacts these policies had on local communities (Ghimire and Pimbert 1997; Leader-Williams 2000). In the latter half of the 20th century, tensions between conservation and local communities escalated as human populations grew and more land was set aside for wildlife protection. In response, a number of community-based conservation programs emerged in the 1990s, such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe (Balint 2007) and ADMADE in Zambia (Matenga 2002), which sought to encourage local involvement in meeting conservation goals through increased local participation and benefit-sharing programs (Hulme and Murphree 2001). Since then, much research has been devoted to examining the effectiveness of these collaborative approaches in regions formerly under British colonial rule. These studies have largely found that benefit sharing and the inclusion of local people in PA management improve local support for conservation, although such gains may be insufficient to meet conservation goals (see Wilshusen et al. 2002 and Brechin et al. 2002 for thorough reviews). Absent from the literature is an examination of conservation strategies and collaborative management practices in African countries with more limited exposure to colonial-era natural resource policies, of which Ethiopia is perhaps the best example. Ethiopia has a long dynastic history that dates back to 1000 BC, and lasted until the monarchy was toppled in 1974. During its reign, the monarchy endured, interrupted only by a period of decentralization in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Ethiopia repelled invading Italian forces in 1896, thereby securing its sovereignty and freedom from colonization. While the Italians returned and occupied the country in 1936, this short period of outside control ended in 1941 following liberation by British and Ethiopian forces. As a result, Ethiopia emerged from Africa's period of colonial rule as one of only two countries relatively free of European colonial influence.","doi":"10.1080/08941920903177867","journal":{"name":"Natural Resources: An International Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1147}

CBNRM framework This article uses the community based natural resource management (CBNRM) framework to assess success factors in community mobilization and to provide lessons learnt from programme implementation during the last decade. The overall underlying concept behind this approach is to provide incentives for communities to manage natural resources in a sustainable way (Painter, 1995) through the partial transfer of management responsibility, decisionmaking processes (Taylor, 1998), and user benefits from designated areas (Van der Sluis, 1993; Thakadu, 1997; Arntzen et al., 2003). A community, in the context of Botswana's CBNRM practice, denotes a group of people with varied socio-economic interests and capabilities bound together by their interest in conserving shared natural resources (Cassidy, 2000) and living within a legally defined geographic area. For convenience, as Cassidy (2000:15) expressed, \" a community has normally come to mean a settlement \" or a group of settlements in this context. Thus, selection and definition of a community for the purposes of the CBNRM programme in Botswana is based on residential proximity to the area where active resource management takes place. The CBNRM approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities (Taylor, 1998; GoB, 1999; Rozemeijer, 2001). It is based on the following three key assumptions: @BULLET Locals are better placed to conserve natural resources; @BULLET People will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation; and @BULLET People will conserve a resource that is directly linked to their quality of life.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":704}

A case study of Bardia National Park, Nepal","authors":"Karki S. T.","dAbstract":"Effective biodiversity protection and improved human welfare as 'winewin' situations have been the foundation for protected areas and conservation incentives. However, conserving land in this way can become a development issue that restricts agricultural expansion and resource exploitation, with potentially substantial costs to people living in conditions of high social impoverishment and high critical natural capital. This paper investigates whether Nepal's Bardia National Park and conservation incentives have contributed to the sustainable livelihoods of households. Data on household livelihoods and conservation benefits were collected through a questionnaire survey of 358 households and community workshops in three villages. Different impacts on household livelihoods were observed between the villages. It was found that these impacts were dependent on household characteristics, access to prior capital, and the social position of the household within society. Households lacking resources, being poor and belonging to lower castes were least included and also benefited less from development projects. As finance in the form of development projects from organisations continues to flow to the communities, it is important that detailed livelihood planning focussing on alternative regenerative livelihoods and micro-enterprises in the informal sector is included to target those households that are highly dependent on park resources. Livelihood planning must also include a clear linkage between livelihood enhancing activities and the conservation programme so that communities are aware that the benefits they receive are due to the protected area. Appreciation of benefits and their positive impact on livelihoods is important for the sustainability of incentive-based programmes.","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.054","journal":null,"aid":370}

Maasai may now derive their main livelihoods (and sometimes considerable income) from farming, wildlife tourism, and/or the leasing of land for large-scale cereal cultivation. The spread of large-scale commercial cultivation competes with wildlife for grazing land, and wildlife populations around protected areas are rapidly declining as a result. This paper presents new data to analyse the way returns from different land uses, and the social structures affecting their distribution, influence the land-use choices being made by Maasai around the Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Returns to different interest groups from livestock, cultivation , and wildlife enterprises, seen in the light of current social, economic, and political trajectories, can help to clarify likely future land-use trends in the Mara. In particular, community conservation initiatives that seek to make conservation worthwhile to reserve-adjacent dwellers inevitably have a strong economic dimension. However, the choices made by Maasai landowners are not a simple function of the economic returns potentially accruing from a particular enterprise. They are as much or more influenced by who is able to control the different flows of returns from these different types of enterprise. These findings are relevant not only for the wider Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem , but also for pastoral livelihoods and wildlife conservation elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Human Ecology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":706}

They have in the past been administered to generate government revenue without due concern for sustainability or equity.

The outcomes so far are assessed with respect to social, institutional, and physical context, and the interactions that arose in establishing CBFM. The lessons drawn are that: it was essential that communities obtained rights over the fisheries, strong facilitation was necessary, taking up visible resource management actions greatly helped, success was more likely in homogeneous communities, external threats were a strong limiting factor, clear boundaries and small fisheries were not so critical, and new institutions could be built with as much ease (or difficulty) as modifying existing ones. Effective well-defined partnerships of NGOs and government were not easy to establish but were sufficiently beneficial that in several locations new community institutions for fisheries management were established. This is a slow process, the sustainability of local management institutions is not yet established, although they continued during an interim period without funding, further phased support is planned to strengthen these organizations and to generate evidence of impacts and momentum to influence wider fisheries policy in and beyond Bangladesh. q","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2003.09.014","journal":null,"aid":707}

Based on household surveys and key informant interviews, this study looked at the contribution of dryland natural resources to the livelihoods of two culturally different but neighbouring communities, the San and Mier, bordering Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa. Overall, natural resources represented an important livelihood source for the San, contributing on an average 32% of total annual income, compared to 9% for the Mier. Fuelwood was the predominant contributor to natural resource incomes in both cases. Income quintile analysis showed that dependence on natural resources decreased moving to higher income groups for Mier households, but increased with income for San households. Well-off households still derived higher total income from natural resources; often from the more lucrative sources of such income, notably from fuelwood sales. Contextual factors such as culture and social institutions, among others, influenced access to, and consequently the use of, particular resources and the value of these to households. Sustainable natural resource management interventions should consider these disparities in patterns of natural resource dependence among different income groups.","doi":"10.1080/13504509.2012.708908","journal":{"name":"International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Ecology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1153}

This paper aims at investigating resource utilization patterns and rural livelihoods under changed socioeconomic conditions and changed availability of and access to resources. Necessary data was generated through remote sensing techniques, ground validation and mapping, observations, monitoring, and socioeconomic surveys. The study revealed a decline in forests and an increase in cultivated land due to changes in resource use patterns and resultant land-use intensifications. Availability per capita of forests and pastures declined by 0.72 % and 0.27 % respectively, wool production fell by 47 %; 13 % of the people lost their livelihood from forestry and 39 % in the woollen handicraft production sector. Now, subsistence agriculture constitutes the main source of livelihood, as indicated by a 16 % increase in dependency on agriculture, despite a drastic decline in the cultivated land available per capita.

Although varied, these interventions are premised on the assumption that natural resources are most effectively managed and preserved while benefiting livelihoods if the market-incentives of a liberalised economy are correctly in place. By examining three nationally supported payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes in Vietnam we show how insecure land tenure, high transaction costs and high opportunity costs can undermine the long-term benefits of PES programmes for local households and, hence, potentially threaten their livelihood viability. In many cases, the income from PES programmes does not reach the poor because of political and economic constraints. Local elite capture of PES benefits through the monopolization of access to forestland and existing state forestry management are identified as key problems. We argue that as PES schemes create a market for ecosystem services, such markets must be understood not simply as bald economic exchanges between 'rational actors' but rather as exchanges embedded in particular socio-political and historical contexts to support the sustainable use of forest resources and local livelihoods in Vietnam.","doi":"10.1007/s10745-012-9480-9","journal":null,"aid":712}

Based on studying in-depth surveys and participatory mapping in the eastern rain forest highlands, we outline patterns in farmers' responses, exploring the relationship between sociodemographic factors, livelihood strategies, and patterns of land use. Our findings suggest that heterogeneity in farmers' adaptation capacities is closely related to different land use patterns. Furthermore, both conservation and agricultural sustainability have suffered from unintended impacts: an increase of forest clearing, intensification 21 in cultivated area, and an impoverishment of the poorest households. These detailed reviews of household adaptation processes suggest that the zoning-based management scheme would benefit from incorporating a more detailed farm level land use approach.

Analyzing survey data from eight villages, this paper shows that in the SANAPA area, livelihoods are highly dependent on natural resources, but both agriculture and fisheries are experiencing a decline in productivity and profitability. Population stressors include a high population momentum, early marriages, teenage pregnancies, and migration. Women bear a heavy workload, while having little or no say in decision-making. The public health situation is severe with health facilities few and far in-between; lack of access to clean water and safe sanitation; and many households suffering from diarrhea , malaria, pneumonia, skin diseases, and HIV/AIDS. Environmental protection arrangements are in place in all sites, however, the awareness of protected areas and their benefits is low and many feel helpless in protecting the environment. Climate changedincreasing periods of drought and irregular rainfalldcontribute to food insecurity and health problems. The interconnectedness between these stressors reinforces the need for an integrated approach to addressing coastal conservation and community development in the SANAPA area.","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.05.005","journal":null,"aid":1160}

This top-down conservation approach has led to management decisions seriously threatening the livelihood and cultural heritage of local people, such as the resettlement programme established to move people from villages inside the park, and the reduction of access to resources and traditional rights. This article presents fi ndings from an analysis of the resettlement program, documenting the consequences of the relocation process on people's livelihood in the Sariska Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, India. The results show that local people have had little infl uence on the relocation process, and hardly any say on the limitations of access and use of resources linked to the constitution of this protected area. The article challenges the existing conservation paradigm practiced currently by the authorities in most protected areas in India, and calls for park management to rethink their vision of conservation, by adopting new approaches toward a more collaborative paradigm integrating conservation and development needs.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.79190","journal":null,"aid":1161}

These grasslands are diminishing rapidly, along with other plant communities: saltwater mangrove, coastal lagoon, freshwater grassland and limestone karst vegetation due mainly to agricultural and aquaculture development and limestone mining for cement production. (Triet et al., 2000). Classified in its natural state as 'unproductive', the Ha Tien Plain has been the testing ground for several episodes of failed economic development , including forestry (22,000 hectares of abandoned Eucalyptus plantation), rice (extremely low yield) and the ongoing boom in shrimp aquaculture (highly acidic water requiring constant neutralization ) (Triet, 2004). These activities are failing to alleviate long term poverty in the region while simultaneously destroying the 'natural capital' which could power a sustainable economic engine for the region. Far from being unproductive, the Ha Tien grasslands support a wide array of species diversity of both plants and animals (Triet et al., 2000; Triet, 2001 ). Yet the value assigned to that biodiversity has been low – due to Viet concern for ensuring its own food security and raising its citizens out of poverty. The centrally planned economy rewards provinces for attaining production targets for rice and other low valued staples and in doing so, provides no incentive to include conservation within its land use mix. The natural capital of the Plain is therefore being heavily exploited without bringing significant economic gain to the local population. The problem facing the Ha Tien Plain is a near universal one in the developing world – the perceived conflict between development and conservation . Some new models of sustainable economic development need to be implemented to break this downward spiral. Recently, there has been a shift from expert-based approach to participatory, community-based approaches in conservation management (Agrawal and Gibson, 1999; Berkes 2004). Located within the Ha Tien Plain, the 2000- ha wetland of Phu My Village, Kien Luong District , Kien Giang Province supports the last extensive remnant of Lepironia grassland ecosystem (named after the dominant sedge species Lepironia articulata -Cyperaceae) of the Mekong river delta (Figure 1 ). The Phu My wetland is not only important for biodiversity conservation, but also provides an economic base to the Khmer ethnic minority who harvest Lepironia for production of woven goods. Established in November 2004, the \" Phu My Lepironia grassland conservation and sustainable use \" project (hereafter referred to as the Phu My project) seeks to protect this important wetland by implementing an novel model that combines nature conservation with improving daily income of local people whose livelihood depends upon harvesting natural resources from the wetland. The project began by successfully convincing the Kien Giang province authority to grant protection status for the Phu My wetland. Unlike in many other \" traditional \" protected areas, local people in Phu My still have access to natural resources, but it is now organized in a more sustainable way. Since its inauguration in November 2004, the project has been managed by the Southeast Asia Program of the International Crane Foundation. Funding for the first three years (2004–2006) came mainly from the World Bank (through the Development Market Award the International Crane Foundation received at the end of 2003) and from the International Finance Corporation. In 2007, the project received the UN-HABITAT's Dubai International Award for Best Practices in Improving Living Environment. For the period 2008–2009, funding for project implementation came mainly from Holcim – Vietnam Limited Company.","doi":"10.1080/14634980903566667","journal":null,"aid":242}

The freedom of fishing and an inherent satisfaction in the occupation figure large in fishers' attachment to it. There are strong indications, however, that the relationship of fishers to fishing is changing. First, while fishers from both areas wish to keep fishing in the future, they are moving into different occupations or supplementing their work in fishing with other employment. Second, artisanal fishers from Piriá polis and Paraty identified fishing as an undesirable occupation for their children because they believe that in the future fishing will no longer be a viable occupation. Nonetheless, despite the wishes of their parents, young men and women in Piriá polis and to a much lesser degree in Paraty continue to become involved in fishing and fishing-related activities. The paper uses a social wellbeing perspective to interpret fisher responses to the changing circumstances they face. Wellbeing is a lens to understand the distinctive features of artisanal fisheries and helps to understand fishers' disenchantment with fisheries governance processes, in a scenario where participation is being promoted by the state in Uruguay and Brazil. The implications of these findings for state efforts to promote fisher participation in governance are discussed.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":716}

From 1885 to 1915, as part of colonialism's entrenchment in local African communities, the successive Cape Colony and South African governments first instituted the structures of state control over indigenous forests, absorbing demarcated areas into a government reserve system and regulating and policing popular access to forest resources. Building upon this formative period, apartheid planners embarked on an aggressive afforestation programme in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the district, culminating in the complete removal of the communities of one ward, the Gqogqora location, and their replacement with exotic tree plantations. Despite the significant and often drastic changes colonial and apartheid schemes brought to local residents, these experiences have been largely silenced by inherited state narratives of the Transkei's 'conservation' and 'development' history. Contrary to such accounts, the introduction and expansion of state forestry in Transkeian communities was a highly contested process, as African men and women negotiated increasing state intrusions into their livelihoods amid deeper social and ecological changes in their lives. Popular experiences and memories of this history reveal the significant conflicts over meaning – the meaning of both forest resources and state interventions into their use – which accompanied the reconfiguration of local environments and peoples.","doi":"10.1080/0305707032000060458","journal":{"name":"Journal of Southern African Studies Journal of Southern African Studies","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":717}

M. and Vedeld P. and Gombya-Ssembajjwe W.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction Forests provide both indirect non-use and direct use benefits. Access to forest resources is an important source of livelihood that provides cash or subsistence income to residents of rural areas (Babulo et al., 2008; Fisher, 2004; Mamo et al., 2007; Naughton-Treves et al., 2005; Vedeld et al., 2007). Forest resources may be used on a regular basis, particularly by individuals living within the forested areas, if not as a primary livelihood option, then as a supplement that may yield even more than agricultural production (Shackleton et al., 2001). Alternatively, such resources may be drawn upon seasonally to fill gaps created by inadequacies in other preferred sources of livelihood, or only as a safety net in case of emergencies such as long drought spells or famine amongst forest neighbours (Takasaki et al., 2001). Rent derived in this way through the direct utilisation or sale of a product of nature by the individual who first collects the product, is referred to as \" environmental income \" (EI) (Vedeld et al. 2004). Many of the world's poor live adjacent to forested areas and depend on EI from these areas (Kaimowitcz, 2003; Sunderlin et al., 2005; Vedeld et al., 2004; World Bank, 2002). A World Bank meta-study (Vedeld et al., 2007) has shown that dependence on EI varies between cases, but is nevertheless generally significant to livelihoods. EI is especially important for the most marginalised and often highly vulnerable members of society (Beck and Nesmith, 2001; Cavendish, 2000), many of whom live at the margins of the cash economy deriving most, and in some cases, all of their cash requirements from EI (Arnold and Townson, 1998).

This paper draws on research conducted in western Botswana, which examined community development and wildlife management in a Kalahari Wildlife Management Area. It focuses on the livelihood dynamics of residents living in two remote settlements in the Wildlife Management Area. These livelihood dynamics are closely linked with the complex history of resource use and con ict in the area. Hunting and gathering, two key livelihood activities, are examined in detail. The paper argues that, although the natural resource base has changed, and use of natural resources has in many cases dwindled, livelihoods based on these resources remain important in terms of cultural identity, symbolic signi cance and as a real and perceived safety net in times of stress.

The dynamics of people's livelihoods are not always recognised by those implementing the changes.

K. and Dkhar M.","dAbstract":"Ever since their emergence on this planet, human beings have depended on forest resources for their requirements, ranging from food, fuel to shelter. Sustainable extraction of forest resources has been promoted by conservationists and development agencies as a feasible strategy for forest dwellers, which does not diminish the resource base. Yet surveys of actual resource use suggest that for poorer resource-dependent communities without access to markets, non-timber forest products (NTFPs) can only act as a safety-net and a supplementary income source. In southern Meghalaya of India, NTFPs and medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have become an important source of cash and subsistence income for poor people living in or near forests. People in this region have traditionally been collecting different forest products from private forests as well as community conserved forests. The study reveals that NTFPs contribute signifi cantly towards the annual cash income of the local population. The contribution of NTFPs to their income was highest in the case of poor families (9.89%), followed by middle income families (3.34%) and the least for the higher income families (1.34%). Our household survey revealed that 100% of the population is directly or indirectly dependent on NTFPs.

{"filename":"Uberhuaga 2011","year":2011,"title":"Indigenous Forest Management in Bolivia: Potentials for Livelihood Improvement","authors":"Uberhuaga P. and Larsen H. O. and Treue T.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Forests play a crucial part in the livelihoods of about 800 million people in developing countries (Chomitz et al. 2007), including forest dwellers, agricultural populations drawing on nearby forests, and those processing and trading forest products (Arnold 2002). While potentials for providing avenues out of poverty are questionable, forest resources are generally considered important in poverty prevention as rural households may use forest incomes to fill recurrent gaps in agricultural returns and/or fall back on forests in times of crises (Sunderlin et al. 2005, Wunder 2001). Over the past 20 years decentralisation of forest management has increasingly been promoted as a way to increase efficiency and equity in natural resources management (Hobley 1996, Ribot 2002). Central government's principal motive for decentralisation is often forest conservation (Larson et al. 2006); according to theory and emerging empirical evidence on the attributes of the forest resources as well as the local management institutions and their degree of autonomy vis á vis higher level institutions, this may be achieved through local institutions that are more efficient and effective than centralised forest agencies (Chhatre and Agrawal 2008, Ostrom 1999). To make economic sense, local institutions must be able to generate a net-gain from forest management and this may be associated with an equitable distribution of costs and benefits among forest users if meaningful powers are allocated to local leaders who are accountable, and therefore responsive, to local peoples' needs and priorities (Andersson and Gibson 2006, Blair 2000, Ribot et al. 2010). Accordingly, decentralised forest management programmes may increasingly be considered to simultaneously pursue the three objectives of forest conservation, good governance (through democratisation) and livelihood improvement ( Treue 2008, Ribot et al. 2010), with the latter reflecting a global focus on poverty reduction (Schreckenberg and Luttrell 2009). In the world's 30 most forested countries, local communities and indigenous peoples presently own or are the designated users of about 13% of the forest area, and this figure is still increasing (Sunderlin et al. 2008). It is not at present clear, however, how the transfer of powers to manage natural resources affects the livelihoods of forest users (Andersson 2003, Larson et al. 2007). There is emerging evidence that participatory forest management can serve to stop forest degradation ( Agrawal 2008, Shreckenberg and Luttrell 2009). On the other hand, examples of increased downward accountability and responsiveness of local leaders are few, probably because, in practice, decentralisation has often promoted elite capture in the local arena (Bardhan 2002, Crook and Sverrison 2001, Mansuri and Rao 2004, SpringateBaginsky and Blakie 2007, World Bank 2005). Decentralised forest management has been reported to result in inequitable decision making, benefit distribution and labour contribution (Bandiaky 2008, Blessing et al. 2006, Dasgupta and Beard 2007, Iversen et al. 2006, Pacheco 2005, Saito-Jensen et al. 2010 ) and potentials for livelihood improvement of the poorest forest users are found to be conditional upon a number of institutional measures ( Saito-Jensen et al. 2010, berg and Luttrell 2009, Springate-Baginsky and Blakie 2007). Forests cover 48.6% (53.4 million ha) of Bolivia, representing around 10% of the tropical forest in Latin America. About 70% of the country's forests are located in the lowlands (departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando and part of Cochabamba) where the potential area for permanent forest production is close to 29 million ha (Malky 2005). Bolivia is among the countries that have transferred most forest rights to local communities in recent years (Boscolo and Vargas 2007, Sunderlin et al. 2008) and the national forest reforms are considered comparatively progressive due to their specific accommodation of rural livelihoods (Colchester 2006). The forest reforms expressed in the 1996 Forest Law have to a large degree targeted the marginalised indigenous communities who inhabit the tropical lowlands and engage in widespread daily use of forest products (). Eighty per cent of the indigenous population is characterised as poor (UDAPE 2009), compared to 63% of the total Bolivian population (UNDP 2007). However, indigenous forest management under the 1996 Forest Law appears to have produced mixed resulted in terms of equity and improved rural livelihoods . Andersson and Pacheco (2006) report equitable benefit sharing among groups of forest dependent smallholders, including indigenous and non-indigenous people, while Stearman (2006), Baker et al. (2006) and Benneker (2005) report cases of elite capture and lack of transparency among indigenous forest users. The present study contributes towards an understanding of the potentials for and challenges to indigenous livelihood improvement through decentralised forest management in the lowlands of Bolivia. The study analyses governance and livelihood outcomes of forest decentralisation, specifically (i) how the change in formal rights have affected indigenous communities' and individual households' access to forest and other resources as well as their access to forest-based and other revenues (Ribot 2004, Schlager and Ostrom 1992); (ii) how the national rules on indigenous forest management have affected decision-making within communities (Long 2001, Ribot and Peluso 2003, Saito-Jensen et al. 2010); and (iii) how forest decentralisation has affected indigenous livelihood platforms and outcomes. Furthermore, the effect of indigenous forest management on forest conservation is briefly considered.","doi":"10.1505/ifor.13.1.80","journal":null,"aid":1167}

People are very poor in the area, also beyond the areas close to the park. The average income is around 0.45 USD per person per day. People report food shortages in two out of the last five years. Even \" the least poor group \" earns no more than an average of 2 USD/cap and day. Main incomes (80%) are derived from agriculture and non-farm incomes. There is a differential diversification pattern where poor people depend more on selling their labour within agriculture, while the less poor group depends more on non-farm activities. Environmental (forest and natural resources) incomes are low, compared to what is typically found in such rural areas, making up 6.3% of total incomes. Living close to the park incurs costs in the range of 2 to 20% of total household incomes, mainly through wildlife raiding crops and livestock; the scale depending on village location. The study documents that attempts to reduce tensions between local people and the park through outreach activities yield negligible results compared to the costs people incur, and do little to reduce the conflict-ridden park-people relations. Although the park may not necessarily be a \" poverty trap \" , it must be seen as yet another and substantial constraint for people securing their livelihoods. Increasing land scarcity, population densities, income inequalities all imply mounting pressures that aggravate resource use conflicts. Furthermore, the present situation with external political interference in selection and implementation of outreach activities is not conducive to progress. Given that 24% of Tanzania consists of wildlife protected areas, much more focused, rights-based and location specific approaches should be developed to reduce losses, and to secure local people's rights to income from the parks and due compensation for accrued costs. People should have formal rights to access park resources that can be subjected to controlled, sustainable harvesting. The present park management culture in terms of attitudes, values and norms needs to change through training in how to work with local people. Such interventions would help reduce conflict levels.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2012.01.008","journal":null,"aid":1181}

Interventions to encourage growth of NTFP markets, however, often succeed at reaching only subsets of target populations. To address impacts of changing NTFP markets on livelihoods and sustainable forest management, value chain and livelihood systems analyses were used to evaluate impacts of a buriti (Mauritia flexuosa) handicraft market on heterogeneous buriti users in Maranhão, Brazil. Data were obtained through interviews with 97 individuals who operated as different types of buriti users. Buriti value chain diagrams were constructed by identifying patterns among responses. Socioeconomic characteristics of actors were identified using statistical means comparisons. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the socioeconomic factors that correlated with peoples' role in the value chain. Results showed that the new market has introduced new individuals who interact with pre-existing buriti users. Actors differ by livelihood strategy, socioeconomic factors, and perceptions regarding sustainability of leaf collection. Social heterogeneity in NTFP value chains should be considered by initiatives that seek to influence participation in NTFP markets, evaluate effects of commercialization on livelihoods, and effectively design and implement resource management strategies.","doi":"10.1080/14728028.2013.868707","journal":null,"aid":726}

Its dissemination to local communities, however, has turned out to be a rather controversial process. On the basis of two case studies this article assesses the extent to which the new approach has been adopted in Mozambique, and the conditions on which it has been accepted by local communities. The results indicate that the CBNRM model cannot be considered independently of the local political context, even though this aspect has been largely neglected. Devolution of full authority to local institutions is also a crucial issue. Restrictions on the use of natural resources are acceptable to the local population, but only if they are compatible with local livelihood strategies.","doi":"10.1002/sd.240","journal":null,"aid":727}

G.","dAbstract":"Selecting the case study villages Within the CMEAMF project area, three regions that had been practising PFM or had initiated a PFM process were purposively selected to include the two major forms of participatory forest management in the area as facilitated by a range of institutions. Where possible, two communities -one engaged in JFM and one engaged in CBFM -were randomly selected from each region. In two of the regions an additional control community without PFM initiatives was randomly selected. The nine study villages and their main attributes are presented inTable 1 and their location shown inFigure 1. – which differ in terms of forest ownership and cost/ benefit flows. CBFM takes place on village land or private land, with the trees being owned and managed by the village government through a Village Natural Resource Committee (VNRC), a group or an individual. In CBFM the owner carries most of the costs and accrues most of the benefits relating to management and utilisation. The role of central government is minimal while the district authorities only have a role in monitoring. In contrast, JFM takes place on 'reserved land' that is owned and managed by either central or local government and normally in forests protected for biodiversity or water catchment values. Villagers in JFM agreements share management responsibilities with the forest owner. PFM in Tanzania was envisaged to help deliver two broad policy outcomes: improved forest condition and improved people's livelihoods (Blomley and Ramadhani 2006), in a manner congruent with the general national poverty reduction process (URT 2005). The last few years have seen a strong government interest in expanding PFM across the country. By 2006, 11% of the total forest area was under PFM and 1821 villages (or 17.5%) were involved in the process (Blomley and Ramadhani 2006). At the same time, there has been increasing concern to understand the extent to which PFM is managing to achieve its aims (URT 2003). There seems to be general agreement that PFM (both in the CBFM and JFM form) improves forest condition (Sauer and Abdallah 2007, Blomley et al. 2008), but conflicting results have been reported on its contribution to livelihoods (Topp-Jørgensen et al. 2005, Blomley and Ramadhani 2006, Luoga et al. 2006). This confusion is in part caused by the way different authors have defined livelihood outcomes of PFM, with some focusing narrowly on incomes from forest products and others taking a broader approach and including impacts of PFM-associated income-generating activities and improved stoves (e.g. Luoga et al. 2006, Mrosso 2006). This is particularly the case for JFM, which is characterised by a very limited level of decentralisation, that denies communities user rights for commercially valuable forest products, limiting their potential forest-based income (Blomley and Ramadhani 2006, Ribot 2002 cited in Tacconi 2007, Topp-Jørgensen et al. 2005).

This study investigates the effects of protection over 19 years on substrate composition and fish communities in four marine sanctuaries and corresponding non-sanctuary areas in the Philippines and examines the importance of community support, management measures and enforcement of regulations on these ecological effects. Between 1981 and 2000, substrate cover variables were measured using line transects with scuba and snorkel surveys, and fish censuses (identification to family level) were conducted using scuba within a 500 m 2 area. Semi-structured interviews collected data on community support for the sanctuaries, and observations and interviews established management and enforcement aspects of the sanctuaries. Over time, all sanctuaries showed improvements, or maintenance of, ecological variables compared with pre-enforcement times, with maintenance of hard coral cover and average increases of 8.3% in fish species richness and 54.9% in fish abundance. In comparison, non-sanctuary areas showed maintenance of the status quo or declines in ecological variables. However hard coral cover, fish abundances and fish species richness showed significant declines as well as increases in sanctuary areas. Community, management and enforcement factors were significantly related to positive ecological trends in sanctuary areas; management and enforcement were related to a wider variety of ecological factors than community score. Community support was significantly related to an increase in hard coral cover in deep areas. Enforcement of regulations was significantly related to an increase in abundance of fishery target fish species in sanctuary areas, and simple management measures were significantly related to an increase in abundance of large predators. Supportive communities that voluntarily implemented sanctuary regulations, improved enforcement, and small discrete cohesive communities may have facilitated the process of building this community support. Well-enforced sanctuaries that showed an increase in abundance of target species may have contributed to the maintenance of fish yields in adjacent non-sanctuary areas. The effects of sanctuary implementation varied on a case-by-case basis, influenced by environmental, biological, physical and human factors. However, a combination of community support, management measures and enforcement of regulations contributed towards positive ecological trends in sanctuary areas.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892903000407","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":734}

J. and Walpole M.","dAbstract":"Ensuring local support for protected areas is increasingly viewed as an important element of biodiversity conservation. This is often predicated on the provision of benefits from protected areas, and a common means of providing such benefits is tourism development. However, the relationship between receipt of tourism benefits and support for conservation has not been explored. This study examined local attitudes towards protected area tourism and the effects of tourism benefits on local support for Komodo National Park, Indonesia. Komodo National Park is a flagship for tourism in a region where protected areas are becoming increasingly visited and where local support for conservation has not been investigated. Results of a questionnaire survey revealed positive attitudes towards tourism and high support for conservation (93.7%), as well as a recognition that tourism is dependent upon the existence of the park. Positive attitudes towards tourism were positively related to the receipt of economic benefits, and to support for conservation. However, a positive relationship between receipt of tourism benefits and support for conservation was not identified, suggesting that benefits from protected area conservation make no difference to local support for conservation. Local people recognized distributional inequalities in tourism benefits, and the most common complaints were of local inflation and tourist dress code. To fully identify the impacts of protected area tourism, long-term studies of local attitudes alongside traditional economic and ecological assessments are recommended.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":735}

Timber production was the initial motivation for early mangrove reforestation projects. More recently, benefits from protection against erosion and extreme weather events and direct improvements in livelihoods and food security are perceived as justifications for such restoration efforts. This study examines the socioeconomic impacts of a community-led reforestation project in the Philippines through a survey of the local fishers. Revenues from mangrove fisheries, tourism and timber result in an annual benefit to the community of US$ 315 ha −1 yr −1. This figure is likely to be considerably more if the contribution of the mangrove to the coastal catch of mangrove-associated species is included. This estimate only includes direct benefits to the community from mangroves, and not intangible benefits such as coastal protection, which paradoxically is perceived by the community as one of the most important functions. More than 90% of all fishers, regardless of where they fished, thought the mangrove provided protection from storms and typhoons and acted as a nursery site and should be protected. Those fishing only in the mangrove perceived more benefits from the mangrove and were prepared to pay more to protect it than those fishing outside. This study concludes that replanting mangroves can have a significant economic impact on the lives of coastal communities. Acknowledgement of the value of replanted mangroves compared with other coastal activities and the benefits they bring to the more economically-vulnerable coastal dwellers should support better informed policy and decision-making with regard to coastal habitat restoration.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892906003341","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1193}

Exploring perceptions not only gives us insight into decision-making (agency) but also reveals structural constraints influencing those decisions (including perceived constraints). This study focuses on the human–nature dynamics of Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China, a biodiversity hotspot and the only habitat for the Guizhou golden monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi). The monkey is endangered and increasingly threatened by growing human activity and development but is also affected by changing habitat through reforestation programs. This research aims to understand how human demographics, a recent reforestation program (Grain-to-Green), land use, livelihood, and perception of conservation may affect local people's perception of human impact on the environment. This perception underlies many land use decisions yet is not uniformly shared among FNNR inhabitants. Using logistic regression, the data from a 263-household survey conducted in the spring of 2010 were analyzed. The results indicate the Grain-to-Green Program participation is insignificantly related to perception of human environmental impact. However, personal observation of the golden monkey is vital to locals reporting an enhanced appreciation for potential human environmental impacts. Other significant factors predicting sensitivity to human environmental impacts include having heard of climate change, interest in tourism entrepreneurship, current worries of food security, viewing FNNR regulations as restrictive, income source, and fuelwood consumption. Results suggest the importance of examining environmental perception for a more integrated understanding of coupled human and natural systems (CHANS).","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Ecological Modelling","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":736}

This paper examines these important issues in Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, located in central Bhutan. A survey of 274 households was carried out to assess farmers' perceptions of the influence of Park management policies and protection regimes on traditional resource uses, and their attitudes towards the Park and conservation policies set forth in the Forest and Nature Conservation Act of 1995, integrated conservation development programmes (ICDPs) and wildlife conservation, and determine how demographic and socioeconomic variables influence these attitudes. Among local farmers, 52.2% disliked the Park and the Conservation Act, and 67.5% supported exterminating problem wildlife. Negative attitudes were linked to loss of resource use rights, livestock depredation and crop damage, lack of compensation strategies and exclusion of farmers from the Park's planning processes. However, 76.3% of the respondents appreciated the Park's development programmes , the positive attitudes associated with an expectation that significant economic benefits would be available from ICDPs sponsored by the Park. Empowerment of local communities associated with monetary benefits from non-timber forest products and compensation for loss of crops and livestock were emphasized by more than 70% of the respondents. These attitudes were related to age and literacy of the respondents, number of livestock owned and size of land holdings. Though important to the future of Bhutan's parks, study results also have wider applicability to conservation professionals throughout the developing world for resolving human-land use conflicts and involving local farmers in the protection of nature.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892906002931","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":737}

The success of conservation projects is widely recognized to depend upon the positive attitudes of local communities and thus it is important to know if ecotourism affects local perceptions of natural resources and conservation, as these can be important determinants of conservation behaviour. Rapid Rural Appraisal and questionnaire-based interviews were used to investigate this issue in the village of Grande Riviere, Trinidad. This has a community-based ecotourism programme for leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea, and is also one of the few sites where the Critically Endangered endemic Trinidad piping-guan Pipile pipile may be sighted. Topics addressed were knowledge and awareness of local conservation issues, focusing on attitudes to the environment in general, turtles and the Trinidad piping-guan. Ecotourism significantly affected perceptions. Villagers showed more awareness and support for turtle conservation than for the piping-guan or any other wildlife. Moreover, those households directly benefiting from the ecotourism industry had better knowledge of local natural resources and greater general awareness of conservation issues (not limited to turtles). Other socioeconomic factors such as education and income also affected attitudes and knowledge but the ecotourism effect was still present after accounting for these. Hunting was seen as the main threat to wildlife but was also a popular pastime, illustrating the potential for mismatch between attitudes and conservation behaviours.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605309000064","journal":null,"aid":1197}

In-depth stakeholder surveys using 12 performance indicators were used to evaluate the perceived outcomes of the Sagay Marine Reserve (SMR), the Philippines. These indicators were a measure of whether the SMR had achieved its management objectives in the recent past and what local stakeholders expected in the future. The respondents' contextual situation could be correlated with their perceptions of SMR indicators. There was a generally high level of perceived equity and efficiency of SMR management outcomes, but the sustainability of the SMR, particularly the condition of the fisheries, had been poor over the previous 10 years. Few anticipated an improvement in sustainability indicators over the next 10 years. Respondents from an island village within the SMR had more negative (or less positive) perceptions of SMR outcomes because of their high dependence on the degraded resource, combined with physical and economic isolation. Specific remedies to enhance island villagers' satisfaction, such as greater participation, empower-ment, alternative economic opportunities and fisheries protection, and replenishment, are necessary. This research serves as an example of how indicators perceived by local resource-accessing stakeholders can and should be main components of both marine and terrestrial protected area assessment.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892904001377","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1200}

In 2011, a review of protected area boundaries and management rules was motivated by the need to enhance management effectiveness and the desire to improve resilience to climate change. Through a series of consultations, with the Wildlife Conservation Society providing scientific input to community decision making, the network of marine protected areas was reconfigured so as to maximize resilience and compliance. Factors identified as contributing to this outcome include well-defined resource-access rights; community respect for a flexible system of customary governance; long-term commitment and presence of comanagement partners; supportive policy environment for comanagement; synthesis of traditional management approaches with systematic monitoring; and district-wide coordination, which provided a broader spatial context for adaptive-management decision making.ary management, Fiji, marine protected areas, resilience Co-Manejo Adaptativo de una Red dé Areas Marinas Protegidas en Fiyi Resumen: El manejo adaptativo de los recursos naturales es un proceso interactivo de toma de decisiones donde las estrategias de manejo son cambiadas progresivamente o ajustadas en respuesta a información nueva. A pesar del incremento en el interés por la necesidad de estrategias de conservación adaptativa, todavía hay pocos ejemplos de su aplicación.

B.","dAbstract":"In recent years, wildlife policies that consider the participation of stakeholders have been promoted. An understanding of the stakeholders' attitudes towards conservation and existing policies are critical in designing new policies or sustainable conservation strategies. This paper examines stakeholders' (local people, park staff and professional hunter guides) attitudes , towards the Bénoué Wildlife Conservation Area (BWCA) and towards Cameroonian wildlife policy. The BWCA encompasses the Bénoué National Park and its surrounding hunting concessions that also include some villages. Both the Park and the hunting concessions are two categories of protected areas. Data were collected using informal interviews and questionnaires administered to 114 households from three communities, 17 park staff and seven professional hunter guides. Local people's attitudes towards protected areas depended on the management category of the particular protected area. Local people were positive towards the existence of the Park, but negative towards the system of hunting concession areas. There was local variation between communities concerning these attitudes. Local people were generally positive to maintaining the present Park area, but preferred a reduction in the size of the hunting concessions. Both Park staff and professional hunter guides expressed concern about present management strategies and the extent of illegal resource exploitation. Despite having poor knowledge of the current Cameroonian wildlife policy, most of the local households expressed support for it, but called for increased local involvement in management, off-take and the harvesting of benefits from both Park and hunting concession activities. The Park staff were sceptical about local participation in this context and saw such endeavours as a threat to a sound biodiversity management scheme. The findings indicate the need to strengthen current wildlife policy, promote the involvement of local people and empower the Park staff, both in terms of resources and in terms of skills in interacting with local people. The revised policy should be designed so as to vary according to the category of protected area and allow site-specific adaptations. Local people must experience reduced incurred costs and increased incomes from the Park. An environmental education programme is recommended to extensively disseminate the policy to user groups in the area.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892903000353","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1202}

We investigated how gender differentiated social groups differ in their activities and outcomes for NRM. A total of 46 men's, mixed, and women's groups were analyzed in 33 rural programs in 20 countries of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Significant gender differences were found in relation to group maturity and NRM achievements and approaches as well as important differences in experiences of collaboration and capacity to manage conflict. Overall, we found that collaboration, solidarity, and conflict resolution all increase in groups where women are present. In addition, norms of reciprocity are more likely to operate in women's and mixed groups. Similarly, the capacity for self-sustaining collective action increased with women's presence and was significantly higher in the women's groups. The results demonstrate the importance of gender analysis for collective NRM and particularly the role of women for collaboration in and sustainability of NRM groups.","doi":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.04.018","journal":null,"aid":741}

However, the extraction of NTFPs such as rattan cane may conflict with forest conservation efforts. A better understanding of harvesting practices can help assess the extent of this conflict and guide forest management decisions. This study assesses the accessibility factors that influence rattan cane harvesting levels in Lambusango Forest, Buton Island, Indonesia, and whether the harvesting of rattan cane is affected by the designation of conservation areas. To this end, the analysis adopts participatory mapping, Geographic Information Systems and a questionnaire survey and employs multiple regressions and analysis of covariance. The results show that accessibility, particularly slope and distance, can play a role in the quantity of rattan canes harvested. The presence of conservation forest does not significantly affect rattan cane harvesting levels. This could be due to limited awareness of the harvesters going to the vicinity of the designated conservation areas and mixed sentiments towards conservation efforts due to the long tradition of forest dwelling and harvesting activities. The study concludes that the successful establishment and management of conservation areas require consideration of the specificity of the local context such as the abundance of forest resources, accessibility and historical forest-people interactions, in addition to biological factors.","doi":"10.1007/s10745-010-9358-7","journal":null,"aid":742}

Not only do issues of social fairness arise, but also the effectiveness of the policies may be affected. Many of the policies designed specifically to protect natural resources—regulations on land and water use, restrictions on access, controls on extraction and harvesting of resources, controls and rules on disposal of wastes of effluents , etc.—will to some extent impose additional costs on some economic activities and social groups. How heavy these costs are depends in part on the importance of the resource in question to the livelihoods of affected persons. Hence particular concerns arise when livelihoods are closely tied to the use of natural resources. Examples include fisherfolk who use waters where quotas and bans have been imposed , such as those poor households harvesting shrimp seeds in coastal India, an activity banned in several States of India from the mid-1990s onwards (Salagrama, 2000), and herders where grazing lands have been excised for nature conservation (Sandford, 1983). Tropical forests constitute a prime example of the challenges of sustainable development. They produce diverse goods and services (see Barbier, 1991), including those of tangible and immediate value such as timber, medicinal plants, fruit, etc.; those that arise indirectly through ecological systems, such as nutrient cycling , water conservation, and carbon storage; the option value of future uses of the forests; and the intangible existence values of forest biodiversity and landscape. For those who live and work in tropical forests, the returns to cutting forests for commercial timber, or to converting forest into cattle pasture or tree crop plantation, are often financially attractive, tangible , accrue to the landholder or occupier and generate returns within a few years of the initial investment. 1 In contrast, when forest is degraded or cleared, the loss of environmental services may in large part fall on those current and future generations who neither live in forests nor own them. Without strong and effective countervailing regulation or incentives, those living and working in the forests here and now will thus tend to cut the forests back. Apart from environmental concerns over the loss of tropical forest, there are social questions as well. Many of those living in and around the forests remain in poverty. In some cases, and to some degree, they do not have the capital or technical skills to take advantage of the opportunities . But in other cases, they simply lack access rights to forest. For example, while some groups may have had longstanding use of the forest for hunting, gathering and subsistence farming, they have not had the rights to undertake logging or to convert forest permanently to agricultural use. To make matters worse, policy for tropical forestry and for development in general has often encouraged large-scale conversion of forest. Public road building has removed the natural isolation of forests; 2 cheap credits and tax concessions have funded logging, ranching and tree crop development (see Binswanger, 1991 for the case of Brazil); resettlement schemes have encouraged people to settle in the forest as farmers; and, some land titling regimes have made removal of primary forest a condition of getting formal title to the land (Angelsen & Kaimowitz, 1999; Templeton & Scherr, 1999). Indeed, it is difficult to have policies for economic growth in forested areas that do not, to some extent, encourage the removal of forest. It is thus not surprising that tropical forests have been cleared and degraded at alarming rates in the last 50 years. During 1990–95, FAO reports that more than 65 million hectares of forest were lost in developing countries, out of 2,128 million hectares (Brown, 2001; Mather & Chapman, 1995 ). Governments of developing countries have tried to limit the rate of forest loss by means such as establishing protected reserves where tree felling is banned or restricted , and otherwise regulating logging— measures enforced through state agencies. All too often, these measures have been ineffective . Forests cover large areas that cannot be adequately policed. Some forest users have been able to ignore inconvenient rules: government staff meant to enforce them, bribed or impressed by the political connections of the violator, have ignored infractions. For example , the Forest Department in Madhya Pradesh , India, has tended to deny forest resources to locals, while turning a blind eye to the depredations of the powerful and its own staff (Sundar, 2001). Consequently, forest policy has been reconsidered in many countries, resulting in attempts to involve locals in forest decision-making and implementation (Bass et al., 1997; Poffenburger, 1996). This, it is claimed, should allow decisions to reflect the diversity of local circumstances, give locals stronger rights to the resources and more say in decisions over their use, and so encourage them to conserve the forests. The rest of the article is set out as follows. The next section examines the case of environmental policy for the forests and forest margins of southern Ghana. The livelihoods of the people living on the edges of these forests are then described, and the reported interactions between environmental policy and those livelihoods investigated. Finally conclusions are drawn, with particular emphasis on the potentials and pitfalls of decentralized environmental policy-making.","doi":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.05.008","journal":null,"aid":743}

J.","dAbstract":"The attitudes and behaviours of private landholders toward the conservation of a highly transformed and critically endangered habitat, Overberg Coastal Reno-sterveld (OCR) (a grassy shrubland of the Cape Floral Region, South Africa) are described. Personal, semistruc-tured interviews were conducted with landholders, representing 40 properties in the Overberg region, on topics such as management and utilisation of OCR, the depth of their knowledge of its conservation importance, what they perceive its value to be, and the extent of their willingness to conserve it. General attitudes toward conservation incentives and provincial conservation authorities were also investigated. Farmers more willing to conserve were younger , did not necessarily have a better education, and owned larger farms (>500 ha) with a greater amount of remnant renosterveld (>300 ha) than those less willing to conserve. Attitudes toward the OCR were largely negative, related to associated problem plants and animals and the fact that it is believed not to be economically advantageous to retain it. However, farmers are of the opinion that provision of incentives and increased extension support will provide practical positive inducements for conservation. Landholder education is paramount to prevent further transformation of critically endangered habitats. The success of private-conservation programs depends on the attitudes of landowners toward (1) the particular habitat or species to be conserved (which can vary depending on the type of land use practised and the associated benefits and disadvantages of that habitat type); (2) the conservation agency or extension officers responsible for that area; and (3) willingness of landowners to participate in a conservation program, which is influenced by landowner age, farm size, and the amount of natural habitat left to conserve.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-006-0086-0","journal":null,"aid":1207}

{"filename":"Wunder 2000","year":2000,"title":"Ecotourism and economic incentives — an empirical approach","authors":"Wunder S.","dAbstract":"Within the new array of 'green' products and services, ecotourism claims to combine environmental responsibility with the generation of local economic benefits that will have both a development impact and serve as conservation incentives. Economic incentives are imperative for nature conservation, particularly in remote and ill-monitored regions where a weak presence of the state hinders the use of alternative tools of environmental regulation. In the following, the link between tourism, local benefits and conservation is conceptualised and analysed empirically, using data from the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve in the Ecuadorian Amazon region, near the border of Colombia and Peru. Three Cuyabeno indigenous groups have developed different modes of tourism participation, ranging from autonomous operations to pure salary employment. A quantification of local cash flows from tourism allows for a comparative analysis of income structure, spending, and the impacts on local development and on conservation attitudes. It is concluded that in the whole study area, tourism has actually provided significant additional income. Counter to common belief, the mode of participation is less decisive for local income generation than the tourist attraction of the natural site, the degree of tourism specialisation and the level of local organisation. However, as a conservation incentive, the effectiveness of tourism income depends on the incentive structure inherent in the mode of participation, and on the substitution versus complementarity of other productive activities: only if tourism changes labour and land allocation decisions, will it have a local conservation impact. It is discussed under which circumstances the conjectured link between tourism, local incomes and conservation is likely to be effective. This leads to some general lessons for government policies, for the design of integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs), and to a number of site-specific recommendations for improving incentive structures.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Ecological Economics","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1209}

Potential biodiversity donors did not engage in this payments-for-environmental-services scheme mainly because of their limited time horizon and uneasiness about the conditionality principle. Other complicating factors included overlapping land claims, and the diagnosis of the externality at hand.

This study assesses the current status of local people's economic participation in tourism in the Wolong Nature Reserve using a questionnaire survey. Through evaluation of geographic origin, income, and occupational distribution of operators engaged in tourism-related business, we identified and discussed constraints and opportunities for economic participation of local people. Economic inequity was found among local people, as well as between locals and non-locals, due to limited startup capital and operational skills. At present, only a small percentage of local people receive revenue directly from tourism. In addition, economic leakage and local dependence on natural resources still exist in the study area. To promote ecotourism and sustainable development, the relationships among tourism, local people, and biodiversity conservation in the study area must be strengthened.

Village bylaws devised by communities govern the management of exclosures. We analysed the effectiveness of village bylaws that are used to manage exclo-sures in addressing forest degradation, resolving conflicts among users over natural resource use, and meeting high expectations of users to realise economic benefits from exclosures through enhancing revenue from sale of grass and dry wood. We collected data using qualitative methods during July and November 2008 in two villages of Tigray. The village bylaws mitigated forest degradation by facilitating users to have common goals in the management of exclosures, and resolved conflicts among users by using monetary sanctions including penalties. The village bylaws were not effective in meeting the high expectations of users to realise economic benefits from exclosures. In some cases, the enforcement of village bylaws was constrained by high social capital, which resulted in the negligence among users in exposing free riders. This indicates that high social capital does not always enhance communal resource management. Moreover, recurrent drought, shortage of fuel wood, and the growing number of landless youths in both villages constrained the effectiveness of village bylaws and further expansion of exclosures. Village committees should focus on addressing the low level of rule enforcement and minimise negligence among users of exclosures through developing a sense of responsibility among users rather than focusing on penalties.","doi":"10.1007/s11625-012-0176-2","journal":null,"aid":748}

Concepts such as social forestry, community forestry, joint forest management, and conservation and development projects were meant to reflect such recognitions (Carter and Gronow 2005, Shepherd 2004). Lately, many studies are providing more evidences on the role of forests in rural people's livelihoods. It is indicated that about one billion of the worlds poor depend on forest resources to sustain their livelihoods (Scherr et al. 2003). Studies in sub-Saharan Africa (Babulo et al. 2008, Campbell et al. 2002, Cavendish 2000, Fisher 2004, Mamo et al. 2007, Paumgarten 2005, Shackleton et al. 2007), in Asia (Adhikari et al. 2004, Illukpitiya and Yanagida 2008, McElwee 2008, Reddy and Chakravarty 1999), and in Latin America (Gavin and Anderson 2007, McSweeney 2002, Pattanayak and Sills 2001, Takasaki et al. 2001) have shown that rural households regularly supplement their income from forest resources. Following the Millennium Development Goals of UNDP 1 , attention has been more focused on the possible link between poverty alleviation and incomes from forest products (Anderson et al. 2006, Geller and McConnell 2006, Shackleton et al. 2007, Sunderlin et al. 2005). The underlying arguments linking forest management and poverty alleviation include the correlation between chronic poverty and natural forests (Sunderlin et al. 2005), the role of forest products in filling seasonal shortfalls and as safety nets in times of emergency (Byron and Arnold 1999, Fisher and Shively 2005, McSweeney 2004, Pattanayak and Sills 2001, Shackleton et al. 2007, Sunderlin et al. 2005). However, the main dilemma is whether forest production can successfully be made more pro-poor to provide pathways out of poverty (Sunderlin et al., 2005) or whether going out of the forest is a better and more desirable option to the forest-dependent poor (Levang et al. 2005). Shackleton et al. (2008) argues in their South African study that income from natural products still lift households to income levels approximating those of the wider community hence their importance can not be questioned. The income-equalizing effect of forest income among rural households has also been evidenced by other studies (Cavendish and Campbell, in press, Fisher 2004, LóPez-Feldman et al. 2007, Mamo et al. 2007, Reddy and Chakravarty 1999). In spite of these arguments, forest resources are not adequately considered in the poverty reduction strategies of most developing countries (Oksanen and mersmann 2003) including Sub Saharan African countries(McConnell 2008). This is mainly because poverty analysis based on income or material consumption discounts the role of forests, and hence disregards the impact of the degradation and disappearance of forests and natural resources on the livelihoods of the poor (Oksanen and Mersmann 2003). Most, however, agree that higher value forest products 1 http://www.undp.org/mdg/basics.shtml that have the potential to lift people out of poverty are generally beyond the reach of the poorest groups (Belcher 2005, Sunderlin et al. 2005). Therefore, it is argued that changes in underlying socioeconomic and political constraints including securing and redistributing access are important to secure benefits to the poorest households (Sunderlin et al. 2005). The World Bank forest strategy also prioritised institutional arrangements such as collaborative forest management to enable indigenous groups manage their natural resources (World Bank 2004). However, such expectations need to be confirmed through research that assesses actual outcomes. In a review of collaborative forest managements, Carter and Gronow (2005) indicate that inadequate devolution of power to local community and disproportionate control by local elites are the main threats against social justice and sustainable livelihoods through collaborative managements. Many community-based arrangements take the assumptions of a community as spatially limited and attached group of people with shared norms and interests with homogeneous social structure and thus, fail to understand the multiple interest groups, the processes through which they interrelate, and the institutional arrangement that structure their interactions (Agrawal and Gibson, 1999). Even if the participatory forest management process provides for inclusiveness and empowerment, it might still be insufficient to prevent elite capture of valuable resources unless special arrangement such as for marketing of products is made by the facilitating agency (Hobley and Shields, 2000). This study aims at evaluating and explaining the contribution of forest resources to the livelihoods of local households in the context of participatory forest management arrangement in Ethiopia. It employs the sustainable livelihoods framework. The following are the main questions addressed in the study: @BULLET What is the contribution of forests to the rural livelihood in the study area and what are the most important forest products? @BULLET Are there patterns and seasonal variation in forest use, forest dependence, and forest product preference among income groups? @BULLET Are socio-economic characteristics of households important in explaining such patterns?","doi":"10.1505/ifor.12.1.66","journal":{"name":"Forestry Review","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1213}

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and responses compared using Chi-square test and one-way ANOVA. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the attitude of respondents towards the Ethiopian wolf. The analysis indicated that 73.1% of the respondents had positive attitude towards the Ethiopian wolf. On the other hand, 18.3% of the respondents reported the loss of sheep to the Ethiopian wolf. Distance from the Park and sheep predation were not related (r = 0.06, P>0.05). However, when considering the distance from the Ethiopian wolf habitat, there was a negative correlation (r =-0.44, P<0.05) between sheep loss to the Ethiopian wolf and distance from the habitat of the Ethiopian wolf. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.17, P<0.05) between predation by the Ethiopian wolf and the number of sheep in the area. The faecal droppings of the Ethiopian wolf revealed that 97.8% constituted rodent species. The average sheep loss by the Ethiopian wolf per year per household was 0.62 + 0.09. Based on this proportion, there is minimal conflict between the local people and the Ethiopian wolf in the study area. However, concerned organizations should take coordinated measure to conserve the population of Ethiopian wolf and reduce such conflict even if it occurs at a minimal level.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"International Journal of Ecology and Environmental Sciences","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":751}

Assessing the actual effects of ecotourism at a nature reserve that has a relatively long history of ecotourism development experience may be instructive for other reserves. Therefore, we take Changbai Mountain Biosphere Reserve (CMBR) in northeastern China as a case study, for it is one of the pioneers in embracing ecotourism in China. Personal interviews and informal group discussions were employed to understand local residents' attitudes toward conservation. Factors affecting their attitudes were then analyzed using logistic regression. Results indicate that attitudes held by most farmers are not favorable toward the conservation of the CMBR. It is not ecotourism but rather income from collection of forest products, household crop lands, and migrant labor that actually influences their attitudes. We found that the 1-day-sightseeing tour style, the limited tourism period, and the low level of education and extreme poverty of the local residents, together with existing institutions and lagging regulations make it very difficult for ecotourism to engender local residents' support. We concluded that institutional measures to guarantee local people's sharing in the revenue generated by the reserve, as well as regulations to ensure involvement of the local community in the decision-making process are preconditions for ecotourism to engender local support in China. Providing educational opportunities for children and vocational training for young local residents can also contribute indirectly to enhanced conservation.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":752}

Introduction In China, fengshui (literary means 'wind' and 'water') forests are protected man-made or natural forests which are perceived to have impacts on human livelihoods in terms of granting good wishes, safety, longevity, prosperity, wealth and promotion (Freedman, 1968; March, 1968; Guan, 2002b; Liu et al., 2007). The practice of fengshui can be traced back to the Shang Dynasty (ca. 1700-1100 BC) and the Zhou Dynasty (1066-256 BC); fengshui has been widely practiced after the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC). Fengshui theory considers good fengshui to include good land contour, rich water, abundant trees and bushes. As a whole, an abundant forest is a symbol for good fengshui. No cutting of trees in fengshui forest brings good luck while deliberate damage to it is perceived to bring bad fortune. Good fengshui, abundant forest and good fortune are interconnected (Guan, 2002b). A number of academic scholars believe that fengshui forests developed because of a spiritual purpose of seeking harmony between people and nature (Theatre and Chow, 2000; Yang, 1999). Fengshui forests are very common in China, and in other East Asian countries historically influenced by Chinese culture (Hutterer et al., 1985, cited by Romm, 1987 Kim, 2005). They are usually established at the village entrance, cemetery, and a hill behind the village, backyard, and temple (Yang, 1999). Fengshui forests are categorized into three types according to location, namely village fengshui forests, cemetery fengshui forests and temple fengshui forests (Guan, 2002a,b,c). An example of a village fengshui forest is the 133-ha virgin forest owned by Huang family who had emigrated to the Letu village in Fujian Province, Southwest China about 300 years ago (Guan, 2002b). It is now officially protected through its status as a National Nature Reserve. ''Kong forest'', or forest of Confucius (551-479 BCE), is a cemetery fengshui forest located in Qufu city of Shandong Province. The forest serves as the cemetery of Confucius (whose thoughts have been developed into a system of philosophy known as Confucianism affecting Eastern culture until the present day) and his descendants, which has been maintained for 2400 years. The ancient trees in the cemetery are said to have been brought there by the disciples of Confucius from their hometowns after his death. There are more than twenty thousand trees inside the cemetery, providing shade to the tombs and tombstones. There are many historical sites in the forest commemorating the visits of emperors of various dynasties who came to pay tribute to Confucius and his descendants. Throughout China, temple fengshui forests are very common where a buddhist temple is surrounded by a piece of holy forests (Guan, 2002b). This type of forest provides a cool and soothing environment for the buddhist monks and lay Buddhists practicing meditation and performing various religious activities. The development of fengshui forest is very much affected by political development in China. After the Communist Party took political power in mainland China in 1949, an anti-feudal movement gained momentum and adversely affected traditional Keywords: Customary regulation Guizhou Traditional knowledge Forest history Forest management Forest policy Livelihoods A B S T R A C T Fengshui forests, very popular among the ethnic minorities in the rural areas in Guizhou Province of China, have spiritual symbolic meanings and are strictly managed. This paper examines the nature, history, local perceptions and management of fengshui forests in two Buyi villages in the Guizhou Province. With their long history, the fengshui forests are perceived to provide good wishes, security, unity, fortune, wealth and health to the local communities. Fengshui forests act as a form of ''community based nature reserve'' which maintains the health of natural forests, especially hydrological features and prevention of soil erosion. Cunguimingyue (Folk Regulation and Customs) is the primary local normative mechanism that maintains the fengshui forests in a good condition. The lessons learnt from local fengshui forest management needs to be incorporated in for contemporary China's forest policy formulation as these forests play an important role in rural livelihoods. ß 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. local livelihoods. As fengshui was considered a feudal superstition, fengshui practices were officially suppressed between 1949 and 1978. During this period, the government gradually intervened and phased out local practices of fengshui. Despite this political suppression, fengshui forests and practices were not totally uprooted. By the late 1970s, interest in fengshui revived among the Chinese population. Since China initiated a period of liberalisation and reform in 1978, fengshui has become more popular and important in rural people's daily life (Zhong and Boris, 2007). The fengshui of a site is now routinely considered when a new house or grave is constructed (Ole, 1996), even in urban areas. Very recently, fengshui has been accepted as a subject of study in Wuhan University of Science and Technology for the undergraduates in Construction Sciences, although this generated much debate in Chinese academic and political arenas. Supporters argued that fengshui forest has strong scientific bases in geography, physiology, sociology and philosophy while the opponents maintained that it arises only from imagination and feudal superstition. Amidst this debate, the forestry authorities in China have emphasized the practical and technical aspects of fengshui, rather than political interests. On the one hand, fengshui forests are not officially recognized by Chinese forestry authorities, and hence they are not reflected in any legislative and policy documents (Liu, 2006). On the other hand, forestry authorities call on local government to respect community customs in forest management, including fengshui forests practices and to support research on fengshui forests. Consequently, fengshui forest's ecological and biodiversity conservation value were studied (Liu, 2007; Zhong and Boris, 2007; Zhu, 2007). These studies have shown their significance for biodiversity conversation, soil and water conservation , and people's daily livelihoods. Zhong (2007) showed fengshui forest has formed part of landscaping and architecture development of settlements. It was not until the 1990s that many Chinese scholars recognized fengshui forests' value to institutional arrangement for forestry management. Wu (2008) documented a case of Dong ethnic people in Guizhou Province and illustrated the importance of Cunguimingyue , a common and traditional institutional arrangement in governing fengshui forest. Similar cases were reported by He and He (2000) in Dai ethnic region, Lai and Liu (2004) in Yi ethnic region, Shi in Lishu ethnic regions, Yang and Liang (2004) in Hani ethnic region in Yunnan province, and Chen (1999) in Buyi ethnic villages in Guizhou Province. Guan (2002b) found that Miao people have the tradition to keep fengshui forest for holy purpose and environmental purpose. Studies by Shi and Zhang (2004) and Yang and Liang (2004) reported that Miao people believe that humans originate from nature, and that they should respect nature and manage forests well. Liu (2006), Liu (2007) and He and He (2000) summarized the important role of Cunguimingyue (village regulation, customary law), local culture, and various types of traditional institutional arrangements in local forest management which are not supported or reflected in China's contemporary forestry legislative framework. This paper aims to examine the nature and history of fengshui forests in two selected Buyi villages, local peoples' perspectives on the role of fengshui forests, and village regulations designed to govern fengshui forests. It also suggests policy recommendations on how to enhance the roles of fengshui forest in sustainable forest management.","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.040","journal":null,"aid":753}

{"filename":"Zbinden 2005","year":2005,"title":"Paying for Environmental Services: An Analysis Of Participation in Costa Rica's PSA Program","authors":"Zbinden S. and Lee D. R.","dAbstract":"1. INTRODUCTION Natural resource depletion and deforestation have become major threats to the environment and economies of many developing countries. In Central America, deforestation rates have been estimated at about 2% annually in recent decades, among the highest in the world (FAO, 1997; Kapp, 1998; Utting, 1997). Throughout the region, deforestation has caused severe problems of soil erosion, soil fertility loss, watershed deterioration, and the destruction of coastal fisheries habitats, all with adverse effects on the livelihoods of much of the region's rural population (De Groot & Ruben, 1997). In Costa Rica, the subject of this study, rapid forest loss in the 1950–1970s was driven by many factors: rapid road expansion, credits for cattle exports, and land titling laws that rewarded deforestation (Kaimowitz, 1997). By 1986, the country was one of the most deforested in the region, with an estimated remaining forest cover of only 29% (Chomitz, Brenes, & Constantino, 1998 ). The rate of forest loss decreased considerably in the 1990s, to an estimated 16,000 hectares annually (World Bank, 2000); however, more than half this loss was of remaining primary forests. Large-scale loss of forest cover has many adverse effects. Concerns have been expressed about the sustainability of national timber supplies (Segura, Gottried, Miranda, & Gó mez, 1997 ). Forest loss threatens small-and medium-sized timberrelated firms and leads to an outflow of foreign exchange. Kishor and Constantino (1993) have estimated that nearly two-thirds of Costa Rica's land deforested since 1966 is not suitable for purposes other than forestry, so if land inappropriate for agricultural production is cleared, soil erosion problems are likely. Deforestation-induced soil erosion and run-off are also of critical importance to hydropower generating plants (Orozco & Ruiz, 2001). Loss of primary forest also jeopardizes biodiversity and the country's scenic beauty, potentially threatening Costa Rica's attractiveness for tourism, which is now the country's largest source of foreign exchange. Recognizing the growing severity of these environmental problems, Costa Rica has become a pioneer in policy innovation dealing with deforestation (World Bank, 2000). In the past, Costa Rica established a number of forestry programs that employed direct and indirect subsidy-based incentive instruments to promote reforestation (Segura Bonilla, Kaimowitz, & Rodríguez, 1997). In 1996, the country went even further, adopting a new forestry law (No. 7575) that explicitly recognizes the environmental services provided by forests (Chomitz et al., 1998). This law laid the groundwork for the introduction of a new national forest strategy transforming earlier reforestation incentive programs into a new policy framework called ''pagos por servicios ambientales'' (PSA, or ''payments for environmental services'') (World Bank, 2000). Government programs that reward landowners for conservation behavior are common in industrialized countries. Well-known examples include the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) in the United States, and similar programs in the European Union. But Costa Rica's program is unusual for developing countries , and indeed has recently been termed ''probably the most elaborate such system in place in the developing world.'' (Pagiola, Bishop, & Landell-Mills, 2002, p. 7). The PSA program allows private forest owners to be compensated for the services they provide through activities such as reforestation, sustainable forest management, and forest conservation . The program has multiple objectives, including conservation of remaining natural forests, promotion of forest resources for timber production for industrial purposes, income and rural employment generation, and fostering agroforestry activities among small and medium land holders (Fondo National de Financimiento Forestal (FONAFIFO), 2002). In their recent review of global market-based programs for forest conservation and develop- ment, Pagiola et al. (2002) identify a number of key factors that are critical to the success of incentive-based programs, including: ensuring effective demand, flexibility in program design , ensuring that the poor can participate, and covering transactions costs (p. 286). All of these elements are relevant to Costa Rica's PSA program. Given the importance of this program and the attention it has received in environmental policy circles, understanding participation in the program is vital for future forest policy decisions in Costa Rica and can inform policy decisions in other countries considering similar policies. This study examines participation in the PSA by identifying the factors that motivate farmers, households and landholders to participate in the three PSA program modalities. The analysis employs a survey-based approach to comparing program participants and nonparticipants. The results provide significant insights into the economic, household, and land-use factors influencing landowners' program participation decisions of relevance not only to Costa Rica but else- where. 2. THE COSTA RICAN SYSTEM OF PAYMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES Costa Rica's system of payments for environmental services (PSA) is the result of a more than two decades-long evolution of the country's forestry policies. During 1979–92, Costa Rica implemented a series of programs to promote reforestation including income tax deductions and tax offsets, credits, and municipal forestry funding. In the early 1990s, forestry legislation introduced new incentive-based programs to promote sustainable forest management and forest protection and to ''democratize'' the reforestation incentive program (Segura, 1992). These programs were the direct predecessors of the current PSA programs (Camacho Soto, Segura Bonilla, Reyes Gatjens, & Miranda Quiró s, 2002 ). With a cumulative funding volume of over $100 million, the pre-PSA reforestation incentive programs resulted in about 109,000 hectares of reforested land in the period during 1979–96 (World Bank, 2000, based on data from FONAFIFO). The programs demonstrated considerable impacts but were plagued by numerous problems in design and execution (Thacher, Lee, & Schelhas, 1997) and posed an increasing burden on the country's budget (World Bank, 2000). The major recent innovation in the new forestry law (No. 7575) that constitutes the legal and institutional framework for the PSA system is the implementation of ''polluter pays'' and ''beneficiary pays'' principles to the financing of the national forest strategy. This represents a shift away from nationally funded subsidies toward market-based financing mechanisms (Camacho Soto et al., 2002; Heindrichs, 1997). The forestry law explicitly recognizes four environmental services provided by natural forests and forest plantations: (a) carbon sequestration, (b) protection of watersheds, (c) biodiversity conservation, and (d) the provision of scenic beauty. Under this framework, private land and forest owners can be compensated for providing these services. The law also defines program financing sources, including a tax on fossil fuels, revenues from selling tradable Carbon Offset Certificates (CTOs), revenues from hydroelectric companies which benefit from watershed services, and state funds for forest conservation. The incentive modalities for forest-and landowners were adapted from previous programs and consolidated into three major program instruments promoting (i) reforestation, (ii) sustainable forest management, and (iii) forest conservation (Campos, Finegan, & Villalobos, 2001; Rodríguez, 2002).Table 1 presents the basic characteristics and payment schemes of the three modalities. Each program has eligibility requirements well as requirements that must be fulfilled during the contract period. A landowner can participate in the reforestation program by assigning a certain part of his land to tree planting. The landowner then has to maintain a threshold survival rate (>85%) in order to receive program payments. Forest protection includes a contract in which the forest owner transfers his/her forest use rights to the government for the contract period. The forest owner is not allowed to log timber or otherwise use the forest during this period. In some cases, the government requires a fence around the forested area to prevent cattle from entering. Sustainable management emphasizes the selective harvest of timber. First, an inventory of trees is taken and a detailed logging plan is established . Only valuable trees beyond a certain diameter are marked for cutting. Limited access roads are the laid through the forest plot, and timber extraction is done with as little disturbance as possible. After harvesting, the forest is left for 10–15 years for regeneration. By law, forest engineers (regentes forestales) and forestry organizations act as intermediaries between landowners and the government. They establish a management plan for each area proposed for inclusion and also perform control and enforcement tasks during the contract period . Project documents and various forms of proof of legal land status must be submitted to the National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC) for approval (Rodríguez, 2002). The approval information is forwarded to the National Forestry Financing Fund (FONAFIFO) which disburses payments to land and forest owners after project approval. Each year, a decree is issued that sets priority guidelines for approving projects. Most projects are submitted by individual private landholders, but local PAYING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES 257 forest organizations can ''bundle'' a number of smallholder projects and submit them as ''global projects'' (projectos globales). The rationale for such global projects is that local forest organizations serve as intermediaries between the government and landholders, reducing transaction costs by ''wholesaling'' collections of individual projects and thus making participation more attractive for small and medium-sized landholders (Chomitz et al., 1998). During 1997–2001, the PSA program had a significant impact in terms of area submitted by land and forest owners. By 2001, the total area submitted to the PSA amounted to more than 284,000 hectares, corresponding to roughly 5.5% of Costa Rica's entire national territory (Table 2 ). Over 4,400 farmers and forest owners benefited from the program.Table 2 also illustrates that the large majority of the area receiving PSA payments was under the forest protection modality (84.2%). This contrasts with the distribution pattern in the pre-PSA period , in which reforestation was the major forest activity supported (Camacho Soto et al., 2002). The program consistently has experienced a significant excess demand for contracts. During the field research reported here (conducted during mid-2002), the government of Costa Rica cancelled the sustainable forest management option. Despite this fact, this study included this program option given that it was in operation during the prior study year, 2001.","doi":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.07.012","journal":null,"aid":755}

In fact, the PRC has officially recognized 2538 nature reserves of all categories covering over 15% of the land mass of China (MEP, 2008). Yet despite much recent progress (over 50% of these areas date since 1995), China still struggles with protecting reserves through effective management on the ground. In 1994, the central government issued specific guidelines under official Nature Reserve Regulations (Harris, 2008; Jim and Xu, 2003). But China still lacks any comprehensive national nature reserve law that addresses lessons learned over the last two decades (IUCN, 2006). This statutory vacuum has contributed in part to a host of wellknown problems with the implementation of current protected area policies (MacKinnon and Moore, 2006; PATF, 2004; Xue et al., 2007). Nine different agencies including the SFA, Ministry of Environmental Protection, and Ministry of Construction share responsibilities for nature reserves, yet their actions are not coordinated internally. China's administrative system does not often operate in a transparent, collaborative fashion. It is difficult, for example, to understand the complexities of the relationship between the SFA, which manages the greatest number of nature reserves , and the Ministry of Environmental Protection which retains significant oversight authority over the SFA. At the policy level, there remain major disconnects between Beijing's goals and those of China's provincial governments and the wide array of prefectures, counties, and municipalities within the PRC's decentralized administrative system. Absent a new national law addressing these administrative gaps, current nature reserve regulations do not clarify these multiple, conflicting lines of authority. Certainly, the core/buffer/experimental zones model (loosely based on the UN Man and the Biosphere zoning system) that China adopted some years ago for many reserves has not been implemented with any consistency. And historically, just as the PRC has often privileged economic development over environmental protection, so do the ''prohibitions contained in the (protected area) regulations sit uncomfortably atop whatever other activities are already legal and ongoing on the land at the time of designation , as provided for by local, regional, or provincial economic imperatives.'' (Harris, 2008: p. 114). In addition to the lack of legal and administrative clarity and consistency, China's nature reserves have suffered from inadequate funding. Since the 1980s, the central government has expected local authorities to fund reserve operations. Many areas depend on managerial and local government entrepreneurial behavior for funding reserve activities. This has led to a pattern of inappropriate development inside reserves (Han and Ren, 2001; Lindbergh et al., 2003). A dearth of professional management capacity has also been a problem. As has been noted throughout the developing world, reserve staff, especially those who work on the ground, suffer from low levels of professional training. The most recent published research shows that only about a third of China's nature reserve employees have adequate training (MacKinnon and Moore, 2006; Xue et al., 2007). Recent investment by international NGOs and governments has begun to reverse this trend but much remains to be done (EU-China Biodiversity, 2009). Given this general state of affairs, it is no surprise that staff lack familiarity with the principles of conservation biology and science-based nature reserve design and management (McNeely et al., 2009). Issues around people and nature reserves in China are not limited to professional capacity building. What makes the PRC very different from the US, for example, is that anywhere from 30 to 60 million people live in and around Chinese nature reserves (Harkness, 1998; Jiang, 2005; Jim and Xu, 2003). Chinese managers must grapple with pressures on protected areas from poor rural villagers who often depend on reserves for much of their livelihoods . This is not going to change any time soon; in China, the trick is to protect biological and cultural diversity where human activities remain integral components of the landscape.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1215}

W.","dAbstract":"Causes of human population growth near protected areas have been much debated. We conducted 821 interviews in 16 villages around Budongo Forest Reserve, Masindi district, Uganda, to explore the causes of human migration to protected areas and to identify differences in forest use between migrant and nonmigrant communities. We asked subjects for information about birthplace, migration, household assets, household activities, and forest use. Interview subjects were categorized as nonmigrants (born in one of the interview villages), socioeconomic migrants (chose to emigrate for economic or social reasons) from within Masindi district (i.e., local migrants) and from outside the Masindi district (i.e., regional migrants), or forced migrants (i.e., refugees or internally displaced individuals who emigrated as a result of conflict, human rights abuses, or natural disaster). Only 198 respondents were born in interview villages, indicating high rates of migration between 1998 and 2008. Migrants were drawn to Budongo Forest because they thought land was available (268 individuals) or had family in the area (161 individuals). A greater number of regional migrants settled in villages near Lake Albert than did forced and local migrants. Migration category was also associated with differences in sources of livelihood. Of forced migrants 40.5% earned wages through labor, whereas 25.5% of local and 14.5% of regional migrants engaged in wage labor. Migrant groups appeared to have different effects on the environment. Of respondents that hunted, 72.7% were regional migrants. Principal component analyses indicated households of regional migrants were more likely to be associated with deforestation. Our results revealed gaps in current models of human population growth around protected areas. By highlighting the importance of social networks and livelihood choices, our results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of causes of migration and of the environmental effects of different migrant groups. ´ Areas Protegidas como Fronteras para la Migración Humana Resumen: Las causas del crecimiento de poblaciones humanas cerca dé areas protegidas han sido muy debatidas.

We argue that CNRM policies that ignore internal power relations attract unintended consequences that undermine achievement of conservation and social goals. Both CNRM concept and implementation created new elites (forest committees) who largely operated as corrupt, unaccountable ''village bureaucracies,'' alienating communities from CNRM. Widespread forest degradation and institutional breakdown ensued. Community management became committee management, and part of the problem. Rare ''success'' was associated with idiosyncratic leadership qualities of village heads, suggesting need for enhancing roles and leadership skills of traditional leaders in balancing the exercise of power among CNRM stakeholders, and for broad-based community empower-ment so that members can demand accountability from local leaders. Eucalyptus was perceived to have higher exchange value and to be managed better than miombo, suggesting the need for separate incentives structures and institutional arrangements .","doi":"10.1080/08941920802039242","journal":{"name":"Society & Natural Resources: An International Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":760}

It uses mixed social science methods and a process-based conceptualization of co-management to analyze experiences, and theory of reciprocal altruism to explain major findings of continuing local forest-user commitment to co-management despite six years of conservation burdens largely for minimal financial benefits. It argues that overemphasis on cash incentives as the motivation for ―self-interested‖ users to participate in co-management overlooks locally significant non-cash motivations, inflates local expectations, and creates perverse incentives that undermine socio-ecological goals. Some non-cash incentives outweighed cash-driven ones. Findings support broadening of incentives mechanisms, including via nested cross-scale institutional arrangements for holistic management that integrates adjacent forests into forest-reserve co-management. Strengthened institutions, improving community/government and intra-community trust, improved village forests easing pressure on the reserve, measures minimizing elite capture, and impetus from an external threat, enhanced forest condition. Generous forest rights and appropriate community licensing and benefit-sharing systems also helped. Bureaucratic/donor inefficiencies, wood-extraction challenges, poor forest-based enterprise development, and low resource value undermined performance. Insights on forest-management planning, fair cost-sharing, targeting the poor, and need for social learning are highlighted.","doi":"10.3390/su5051917","journal":null,"aid":759}

Thirty-three ethnographic interviews held in October 2010 found that 81.8% (N ¼ 27) of the fishermen interviewed were able to identify the species by its area of occurrence, coloration, and body size. The subsequent analysis of interviews was based on those 27 fishermen selected. There were no reports of positive interactions, and 52% (N ¼ 14) of those interviewed described negative interactions related to whales ''tearing and/or dragging the gillnets''. Accidents between whales and fishing vessels were described by 44% (N¼ 12) of the fishermen. Accidental captures in gillnets were mentioned in 48% (N ¼ 13) of the interviews and fishermen believed that these events were caused by whales failing to see gillnets in the water (N¼ 4) and by the position of these nets in the routes frequented by the mammals (N ¼ 9). In the fishermen's eyes this type of interaction has minimal impact on fishery. Therefore, is suggested the monitoring of areas frequented by whales and fishery, the use of gillnets away from these animals' migration routes, the search for alternative and lower-impact fishing activities, and the training of local actors for sustainable whale watching tourism in the region.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":15}

It reflects increased global awareness and the desire to travel to more authentic and exotic destinations (McLaren 1998). Usually the ecotourists are from developed countries, and their destinations are in the developing world (Fennell 2003; Appiah-Opoku 2004). Africa has long attracted travelers from developed countries who are interested in seeing tropical landscapes, wildlife, and indigenous peoples. More recently, the African rainforest has become a popular destination for ecotourists who seek not only adventure, but also an opportunity to learn about rainforest ecology and culture and to contribute to conservation efforts (Linden 1991; Igoe and Croucher 2007; Spenceley 2008). The hope is that their vacation dollars will give local communities incentives to protect rainforests and promote cultural norms and values (Stronza 2000). Since the concept of ecotourism emerged some 25 years ago, many sites in Africa have experienced hikes in visitation. Increased revenues from safari expeditions have been used to protect wildlife from poachers and to support education or health care in host communities. For instance, prior to the outbreak of civil war in Rwanda, tourists' visits provided approximately $1.02 million in direct annual revenues, enabling the government to create anti-poaching patrols and employ local residents (Gossling 1999). In 1997, Kenya earned $502 million from ecotourism, and this enabled the government to reinvest in anti-poaching patrols (Weaver 1999). The tropical rainforests are among the most ecologically threatened ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa (Plumptre 2002). Communities in the rainforest ecosystems typically depend on natural resources and biodiversity for food security and livelihoods (Blaikie 2006). Protected areas are increasingly being used as a tool for biodiversity conservation and ecotourism in these rainforest ecosystems and have become part of the Millennium Development Goals. Consequently, their mission has broadened to include a direct contribution to national development and poverty reduction (). Livelihood rights of rural communities are often seen to be at odds with biodiversity conservation in protected areas (Crane et al. 2009; Mazur and Stakhanov 2008). For instance, national parks often restrict local people's access to the natural landscapes, flora, and fauna while attracting ecotourists to these resources. The conservation community is increasingly being challenged to implement measures that respect human rights and reduce poverty (Alcorn and Royo 2007). Reconciling complex and often conflicting relationships between protected areas, ecotourism, and rural livelihoods is a major challenge facing conservationists in the rainforest region of West Africa. Against this background , this article examines the history of the Kakum National Park in Ghana, its operation, and the impact on rural livelihoods in villages that are within the vicinity of the park.","doi":"10.1080/08941920.2010.495108","journal":null,"aid":815}

B. and Rose G. and Mahudi H.","dAbstract":"This study examined the perceptions of fishers from two fishing communities with differing use histories and involvement in the long-standing (16 yr) multiple use Mafia Island marine protected area (MIMP), Tanzania. A randomly distributed questionnaire indicated that 94% of fishers believed that without the MIMP, there would be overfishing, dynamite use, destroyed habitats, and few fish. Fishers were more positive about core zones (no-take fishery closures) than general use zones (areas allowing selective fishing) as a consequence of increases in fishing pressure. Those that reported increased catches and sizes of fish since the creation of the MIMP were more likely to agree with present zone locations and more positive in general about fisheries and conservation planning. Most thought that fish size and gear restrictions were preferable to permanent closures. Perceptions differed among communities and gear users. Community and gear type explained 46% of the variance in responses about the perception that fisheries and conservation are compatible goals. Somewhat surprisingly, these effects were more important than catch increases or involvement in MIMP-related activities. The differences in perception between communities may be partly attributed to different fishing histories. Multiple-use zoning provides a means to identify and resolve conflicts and achieve what are likely universal objectives for fisheries sustainability and conservation.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2013.06.005","journal":null,"aid":26}

Introduction While the formal study of tourism is a relatively new addition to the academic curriculum, tourism itself is a very old subject and one which has been described and discussed for many years. However, as it has become the subject of academic scrutiny in recent decades, it has also become apparent that while we have learned much about it, there is still a great deal more to be discovered, explained, and understood. Nowhere, perhaps, is this clearer than in the relationship between tourism and the environment. It is often assumed and stated that tourism is dependent on the environment, and argued that if the environment deteriorates in quality, then tourism is likely to decline. Such an argument has often been seen as a fundamental element in this authors model of the tourism life cycle (Butler 1980), although as more recent discussions of this model have illustrated (Butler 2006a,b) the relationship is not as simple as it may seem. In exploring this relationship we come across several of the many paradoxes that can be found in tourism, elements which make tourism a fascinating if difficult subject for study, and an equally difficult one to plan and manage in the real world. The relationship between tourism destination development and the environment is a complex one, not least because of two key issues, one is definition of terms, and the other is the change that inevitably accompanies development and indeed, is an integral part of such a process. Without appreciating that tourism is dynamic and operates in a dynamic world, it is impossible to understand and deal with this relationship. It has to be appreciated that change is constant and that inconsistency and chaos can and do exist with order and rationality at different levels.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":36}

To achieve this objective we use a multinomial choice model of engagement (or non-engagement) in forest management activities based on household data from 4 villages surrounding the National Kabore Tambi Park in Burkina Faso. The results show that the participation by household members in forest conservation activities is mainly determined by the three variables that are related to policy: membership in community based forest management associations, security of land use rights, and training. The current training programs focus only on forest conservation practices. To be more efficient it should focus on increasing people's knowledge about the benefits due to conservation and the threats resulting from the lack of forest management. Furthermore the results indicate that improving land use right security would increase farmer's willingness to participate in forest management activities such as community work and forest surveillance. Thus particular attention should be paid to the prevailing system of land rights and its incentives, or disincentives, for promoting sustainable management of the forest resource.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2009.05.005","journal":null,"aid":52}

It is also important for climate change adaptation, as well as mitigation policies on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Men and women relate to and use the forest differently and so may experience the effects of climate change and REDD+ policies differently. Investigations through semi-structured interviews and document reviews in three countries of the region revealed that women have had limited participation in discussions on issues of climate change or REDD+. There is some evidence that gender consideration will become part of future national REDD+ strategies. Strategies to foster the effective participation of all stakehold-ers are essential to ensure that gender dimensions are addressed in issues of climate change, forest access, forest management and distribution of carbon benefits.

The framework is applied to examine the experiences of indigenous peoples in Canada and the Philippines regarding access to fishery resources, and participation in fisheries management and policy. These experiences demonstrate the importance of legally recognized rights not only as a key tool in resource management, but also in the pursuit of secure and equitable livelihoods on the part of indigenous peoples. While it is apparent that in some ways, serious mismatches exist between government policy and local livelihood needs, there are also illustrations of positive change in improving the situation of indigenous peoples.","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.08.011","journal":null,"aid":70}

In parts of the world with a history of armed conflict, the chances of such an approach being successfully adopted might seem remote. One such area is the Maputo Elephant Reserve in southern Mozambique. The aim was to improve understanding of the local people's use of natural resources and perceptions of the Reserve's impact. Interviews and questionnaires distributed in four different villages were used to estimate the relative value of these resources in relation to the attitude of the local people towards the Reserve. The people gave a relative value rank for each specific use of each plant, animal and fish resource. On average 60% of the households exploited more than two different resource categories. The plant resources of the Reserve were used by 71% of the households and were valued more highly than animal and fish resources. Plants were used for many purposes; construction material, fuelwood and fruits had the highest relative values. Antelopes, hippopotamus and elephants were valued highest amongst a range of animal species which were hunted by 21% of households. Amongst uses of animals, consumption, use of the skins and commercial sale of the meat were especially important. When asked if they liked the Reserve, 88% of respondents answered positively. The attitude towards the Reserve was correlated with crop damage experiences; people with crop damage caused by elephants, hippos or bushpigs, were more negative. Attitude of respondents was inversely related to the number of species invading their agricultural fields. Resource use intensity, use purpose, resource value and attitude were different amongst sites and dependent on site-specific circumstances, different management strategies could be necessary for the four sites. A resource management plan should be drawn up, local people should be included in the management team and steps should be taken to improve the relationship between the Reserve's authorities and the local population generally.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":110}

It consisted of the release of three natural enemies, two weevil species and one moth, that feed exclusively on water hyacinth. In 1999, a survey of 365 men and women from 192 households in 24 villages in the target area, using participatory and quantitative methods, revealed that water hyacinth, although not eliminated, was perceived by the villagers as having been reduced from a serious pest to one of minor or moderate importance. According to their estimates of the impacts they perceived, at the peak of the infestation water hyacinth had reduced the yearly income of this population of about 200 000 by approximately US$84 million. Lost revenues for men were mostly in fishing, while women experienced lost revenues in trade, primarily food crops and fish. The reduction of water hyacinth cover through biological control was credited with an increase in income of US$30.5 million per year. The total cost of the control program is estimated at a present value of US$2.09 million. Assuming the benefits are to stay constant over the next 20 years, a most conservative assumption, the accumulated present value would be US$260 million, yielding a respectable benefit cost ratio of 124:1. This ratio is calculated for direct economic effects on the people of Southern Benin only, and does not take into account indirect benefits or the benefits of the project to other countries were the biological control agents were successfully introduced. Other effects mentioned, but not measured, included an increase of water quality and of human health. #","doi":"10.1016/S0921-8009(03)00006-5","journal":null,"aid":111}

M.","dAbstract":"Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) derived from palms and other plants are economically and culturally important to a large part of the more than 240 million people who live in the forest areas of developing countries. The sustainable extraction of NTFPs is increasingly regarded as an important part for forest conservation strategies. This paper provides an overview and comparison of existing statutory legislation with respect to the extraction and trade of NTFPs in four Andean countries and discusses its adequacy with respect to ensuring legal and sustainable extraction and trade of NTFPs. The related legal framework surrounding indigenous peoples' rights, traditional knowledge and access to genetic resources is also reviewed. Forest laws are primarily concerned with the regulation of timber. Hence, legal and administrative frameworks to regulate the extraction and trade of NTFPs are fragmented and ambiguous. By providing an overview over the existing legal situation, this paper seeks to inform and open debates about ways to improve the regulation of the extraction and trade of NTFPs in the region.

Este artículo revisa y compara las normas legales relativas a la extracción y comercialización de PFNM en cuatro países andinos y discute su pertinencia para asegurar su extracción y comercialización legal y sustentable. El marco legal relacionado sobre derechos de pueblos indígenas, conocimiento tradicional y acceso a recursos genéticos también se revisa.

The objective is to assess how the establishment or destruction of the Park distributes benefits and costs among different stakeholders. A household survey of local communities was undertaken to provide social, economic and ecological data. The paper determines the costs and benefits of three management options: (1) The experimental park scenario corresponds to the base case where some level of protection is achieved, but fisheries eventually collapse; (2) the ghost park scenario assumes that all timber and fish are harvested, destroying the area; (3) the dream park scenario only allows subsistence activities, recreation, education and research. At a 10% discount rate, the dream park has the highest net present value (US $11.9 million). This compares with US $10.0 million for the ghost park and US $9.8 million for the experimental park. Although the dream park scenario has the highest net present value, it exceeds that of the ghost park by less than US $2.0 million. However, protection scenarios allocate the bulk of the Park's benefits to local communities. The dream park confers three times more benefit value to villagers compared with the ghost park. Local communities, whose traditional livelihoods depend on the sustainable use of the Park, stand to loose most; commercial loggers and fishing fleets, as well as the Armed Forces, stand to gain most from the wanton exploitation of timber and marine resources. #","doi":"10.1016/S0921-8009(03)00142-3","journal":null,"aid":113}

However, this alone has not achieved the expected results. Partnerships are being established with local communities through research that includes the perceptions of these individuals. Environmental Perception has been used to understand and improve the people-environment relationship in these areas. The Caatinga Biome suffers threats and losses from anthropogenic action. Few of its areas are protected by CUs and further conservation efforts are needed. The Seridó Ecological Station (Seridó ESEC) is one of the few CUs in the Caatinga of Rio Grande do Norte State (NE Brazil). An Environmental Perception study was carried out in this area using Ethnozoology concepts to investigate the perceptions of the surrounding communities and use of local fauna. Ninety-two interviews were conducted in 4 communities with 514 statements obtained in 58 vernacular names. The animal most cited was the Rhea (bird) with 58 citations. Its main uses were medicinal or as human food. The rich local knowledge observed may be used in a partnership to correctly manage local resources in the Seridó ESEC. RESUMO.

It is one of the greatest dilemmas facing the conservation community because of the multifaceted nature of activities involved. The case of the conservation of coastal wetlands in Ghana (from 1993 to 1999) is utilised in developing a 'community conservation interface' (CCI) model for the active participation of local communities. The ethical basis of the model is to promote accountability, transparency and responsibility throughout a project's planning and implementation process. Additionally, the CCI model seeks to provide a forum, the CCI seat, for resolving conflicts, developing further partnership and building capacity. It is a decision-making model that is applicable to community-based conservation and partnerships in protected area management. As an adaptive management initiative built on the concept of community conservation, the model is vital for decision-making forums for managing biodiversity at a broad-scale level. Finally it attempts to unravel the true meaning of participation, and the creation of institutional interfaces for the setting of common goals and indicators.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Ethics, Place and Environment","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":137}

Rather than supporting communal institutions and land rights, however, conservation efforts have strengthened the role of municipal governments, leading to fundamental changes in local governance and livelihood strategies and displacing community participation in natural resource management. The article responds to the following questions: What is the relationship between conservation discourse and the demands of indigenous peoples?

The regular presence of sea lions on the island is not only a touristic attraction in the region, but also a problem to the fishery community. This community faces economic impacts in its activities due to fish depredation caused by sea lions. Because of this issue, the perceptions and attitudes of different stakeholders from the region are important to be considered by managers, so that a realistic and decentralized action plan can be designed. The goal of this study was to analyze how different local stakeholders perceived the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos. Additionally, how these stakeholders differed from each other in terms of attitudes, knowledge and perceptions. In October 2011, January and March 2012, face-to-face interview surveys were conducted with fishermen and tourists, and drop-off questionnaires surveys with business, and tourism professional and teachers, in a total of 150 questionnaires, 30 for each group. The results indicated existence of differences across the five stakeholder groups. It was also suggested that non-direct stakeholders had a more favorable view of the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos and the sea lion, whereas direct stakeholder (the fishermen) saw it as an obstacle to their fisheries activities.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2013.11.012","journal":null,"aid":151}

The study area is focused on the surroundings of Lata Jarum and Lata Jarum itself. This area is rich in biodiversity with endemic flora and fauna. A field survey via a structured questionnaire was conducted on 194 village respondents living in the vicinity of Lata Jarum. This is also complemented by observation during field survey. The data were analyzed descriptively. The most significant finding is that the majority have a neutral perception due to a lack of understanding and knowledge about community-based ecotourism. The other findings indicate that both positive perception and negative perception towards community-based ecotourism have a minority perspective. However, the responses for positive perception are larger as compared to the negative perception. The positive perception is mainly due to pecuniary returns whereas those opposing want to maintain the traditional way of life. The concluding remark is that for ecotourism to succeed with effective local community participation, a dual approach i.e. a top-down and bottom-up approach needs to be adopted. Future research on the dual top-down and bottom-up approach including training and development, will help in capacity building.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"213 Advances in Natural and Applied Sciences","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":152}

C. and Barbosa R. and Fernandes G. W. and Arturo Sanchez-Azofeifa G. and Scariot A. and Rgio S. and Quio De Noronha E. and Sampaio C. A.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are among the most threatened ecosystems in the Americas, where they were historically preferred for human settlements and agricultural activities (Maass, 1995; Ewel, 1999). In Brazil, TDFs extend over 27,367,815 ha, representing 3.21% of its territory (Sevilha et al., 2004), predominantly distributed in the semi-arid northeastern region (Fig. 1). As in other parts of the world, Brazilian TDFs are neglected in terms of research and conservation efforts compared to tropical rain forests (Sá nchez-Azofeifa et al., 2005; EspíritoSanto et al., 2006). For this reason, human occupation and land In this study, we review the current available information on the social–ecological context of Brazilian tropical dry forests (TDFs), a vegetation type that covers approximately 3% of the country territory. For this purpose, we conducted a comparative analysis of two case studies, one study in the north of Minas Gerais state and the other in Paranã River Basin, situated in southeastern and central Brazil, respectively. We compiled published bibliographical and census-based data for the two regions, concerning the historical human occupation and land use and the environmental and development policies affecting TDF management and sustainable use. Brazilian TDFs usually occur in semi-arid climates, and have been intensely converted mainly to extensive pasturelands in large farms, thus leading to high income concentration in those areas. Our case studies involve less-developed regions that support populations with very low human development indices, which is the norm for Brazilian TDFs. Many of these are traditional populations, such as indigenous and slave descendents, with peculiar cultural practices only recently considered in government policies proposed for the forest management. Though the two regions have similar land use histories, current social–ecological scenarios are very different. In the north of Minas Gerais, TDF conversion policies were debated intensely for the last 15 years, recently resulting in a state law specifically generated to regulate TDF use. Also, this region has 20 conservation units (CUs), some of them delimited inside the territories of the several traditional populations that inhabit TDF areas. This process caused enduring conflicts that can affect both CUs' effectiveness and the sustenance of these populations. In the Paranã River Basin, there is no specific policy towards TDFs, whose use is regulated by the 43-year-old Brazilian Federal Forest Code. There are only four CUs in this region, and most traditional populations were expelled from their original territories and consequently lost their cultural identity. Government sustainability strategies are limited to the establishment of CUs, a response that may disregard social demands and cultural practices, depending on the local context. Given the uniqueness and threat level to TDFs, specific and more diversified policies towards land use should be established for these ecosystems in order to stimulate low-impact activities that maintain ecosystem services and improve the livelihoods of TDF inhabitants. ß 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. use, deforestation rates and the real status of conservation of the remaining TDF fragments are largely unknown. As a result of the high proportion of valuable timber species and fertile soils where these forests occur, Brazilian TDFs are in high demand for logging and farming, the main drivers of land cover change in this ecosystem (Scariot and Sevilha, 2005; Anaya et al., 2006). Another important threat is the mining of limestone outcrops, which are commonly encountered where TDFs occur. Due to high deforestation rates and their restricted distribution, TDFs can be considered the most threatened ecosystem in Brazil. Large intact areas are now rare, found almost solely in a few conservation units (CUs), due to the local government's limited conservation strategy towards this ecosystem. In the farmland landscape, only small fragments of TDFs remain, most of them disturbed by selective logging and cattle ranching (Sevilha et al., 2004; Sevilha, 2000, 2005). TDF distribution in Brazil includes some of the poorest regions of the country, thus any conservation strategy for these ecosystems must address human welfare and social justice. The predominant model for nature preservation adopted in Brazil is derived from the American concept of protected areas, which is essentially the conservation of ''pieces'' of the natural world in their original state (Arruda, 2000). The primary expression of this concept is the creation of CUs of Restricted Use (equivalent to IUCN categories Ia, II and III), where the only allowed human activities are the tourism, education and scientific research. Frequently these areas of limited access are established in territories historically occupied by vulnerable human populations, precluding their access to natural resources that are essential to their survival. The paradigm of ''sustainable development'' emerged in the late 1980s (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987) and posed an alternative conservation strategy to CUs and the conflicts generated by their creation. In spite of its vagueness (Mebratu, 1998; Robinson, 2004), the concept of sustainable development implies a consensus among economic, social and environmental interests (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987; Robinson, 2004; Teixeira, 2005). However, the Commission's findings are often interpreted as a set of compensatory actions and technical adaptations to legitimate large market-oriented projects, such as agriculture, mining, energy production and the raising of livestock (Zhouri et al., 2005; Leff, 2006). In this sense, sustainable development strategies usually place a high priority on economic growth and devalue social diversity, ignoring traditional management practices of local populations as sustainable forms of land use and poverty alleviation. In order to address sustainability issues for a given region, it is necessary to analyze the social conflicts involving the access to natural resources, which are inevitably inequitable and determined by longstanding practice. This paper aims to understand the social–ecological context of Brazilian TDFs, through the examination of two case studies in the north of Minas Gerais state and the Paranã River basin, situated in southeastern and central Brazil, respectively. These two regions had different human activities over the past several centuries and were subjected to contrasting developmental and environmental policies in the last few decades. Also, they represent some of the most active current frontiers of deforestation and forest degradation in the country. Thus, we compiled published bibliographical and census-based data to revise the available information on the historical occupation and land use in these regions. We also conducted a comparative policy analysis in order to explain the situation of TDFs and of the inhabitants whose livelihoods highly depend upon TDF manage- ment.","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.022","journal":null,"aid":153}

The evaluation of a geopark is important for geopark development. However, current evaluation methods focus on geoheritage and their values, and often ignore residents' situations, even though community participation is essential to the sustainable development of geoparks. In this paper, the Mt. Huaying Grand Canyon Geological Park was selected as a study area to evaluate resident's perceptions of the park. Perception impact factors were selected from the perspective of the park residents. Quantitative evaluation models, based on data from questionnaires, were created using the hierarchy process model and expert evaluation method. The results showed that the following factors influenced residents' perceptions, listed from the most significant to the least: residents' understanding of geoheritage, participation level in commercial activities, participation level in planning decisions, satisfaction level regarding benefit distribution and level of participation willingness. It was found that residents' level of understanding of geoheritage and their participation level in planning decisions were the main reasons for poorer perceptions of geoheritage. The keys to improving residents' perceptions of geoheritage are to change the management system, implement people-centered policies and to establish a government-led management mode that encourages community participation and involves private business contracts.","doi":"10.1007/s12665-013-2550-5","journal":null,"aid":162}

This paper contributes to sustainable tourism by presenting local decision-making practices and issues arising from the perspective of the members of one village in the Boum¯ a National Heritage Park, Fiji. It shows that introduced democratic decision-making systems may not contribute to political empower-ment in CBEM and can cause difficult situations. It is argued that greater attention to local systems of governance is required if tourism practitioners are to fully understand decision-making and participation in CBEM. The paper also offers a culturally appropriate methodology that may produce more meaningful outcomes for sustainable tourism research in indigenous Fijian contexts, and in other contexts worldwide. It argues that levels of empowerment should not just be treated as the outcome but as a part of the process of tourism development.

More recently, however, parties to CITES have embraced the sustainability discourse and taken steps to address the socioeconomic dimensions of wildlife trade. This paper examines the policies developed by CITES' Parties at four recent meetings, with a view to determining whether they are founded on a holistic understanding of socio-environmental dynamics. It concludes that CITES' conservation approach remains rooted in a conception of sustainability that treats people and wildlife as separate entities, and where species conservation takes priority over human development. Nonetheless, CITES does appear to be moving towards a more all-encompassing perception of sustainability where focus is on ecosystems rather than ensuring the survival of single species.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":724}

Coexistence between subsistence farmers and elephants leads to problems for conservation and food security, especially on the edge of protected areas. Crop-raiding patterns have been investigated for decades, but understanding both social and ecological determinants remains a key challenge to defining realistic management options in a context of increasing human and elephant densities. 2. Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, and its periphery, hosts one of the highest densities of free-ranging elephants. As scale is a critical element of ecological systems, we analysed the determinants of crop raiding at three spatial scales: the study area (217 households in 200 km²), the village (30 fields in 14 km²) and the edge of the refuge area (30 fields in less than 3 km²). We combined foraging ecology with sociological approaches, including a partici-patory experiment, to understand the processes behind the susceptibility of subsistence farmers to crop raiding. 3. Distance to refuge area was the most influential determinant in decreasing crop-raiding risk, with no damage occurring further than 4Á4 km. We obtained consistent models between the three scales with high explanatory power for field damage at village and edge scales (94% and 68% respectively). Household density acted as an obstacle to elephants. Millet patches seemed to provide refuges, and thus promoted damage. 4. The participatory experiment allowed rigorous testing of the efficiency of traditional guarding practices. The presence of people was crucial for guarding efficiency. More innovatively, we demonstrated the role of neighbours and the importance of cohesive guarding as a promising strategy of reducing crop loss at the edge, primarily in areas with a high density of elephant paths. 5. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides evidence that multi-scale multidisciplinary approaches can unravel endogenous processes shaping human–elephant coexistence on the edge of protected areas. We believe that manipulating perceived risks for elephants, through mitigation methods based on the 'ecology of fear', and spatial organization of households, could create a 'soft fence' which, when combined with adequate incentives to farmers, promotes a better integration of the protected area in its territory.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02192.x","journal":{"name":"Journal of Applied Ecology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":228}

Farmers were keen to take up ecotourism and wanted to use the proceeds to increase their livestock herds. However, this would increase pressure on natural resources, causing land degradation. Additionally, income from ecotourism may also lead, in the long run, to social inequality in remote communities.

The Vietnamese government has promoted shrimp farming as a way to reduce poverty, provide employment opportunities and increase exports to support economic development. The shrimp farming system, however, is economically and ecologically risky and may negatively influence the environment and the sustainability of local people's livelihoods. Because very little is known about the diversity of strategies people employ to deal with these risks, a study was performed in the Mekong Delta across four shrimp farming systems: (1) improved extensive non-forest, (2) mixed mangrove-shrimp, (3) intensive and (4) clustered intensive. The risks and livelihood strategies that were encountered differed systematically across the four farming systems. It was found that the uncertainties that the shrimp farmers faced include limited access rights to the mangrove forest, crop failure due to regular occurrence of shrimp disease, high investment costs and volatile markets for shrimp. Shrimp farmers have created several strategies for coping with these uncertainties, including redesigning farms, producing salt, changing the species farmed from Penaeus monodon to Penaeus vannamei, becoming involved in a cooperative cluster, integrating aquaculture and agriculture, and farming shrimp by organic standards.","doi":"10.1080/13657305.2013.747224","journal":{"name":"Aquaculture Economics & Management","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":239}

The paper focuses on livelihoods' strategies and diversification in the context of overexploitation and exhaustion of near-shore resources in relation to fishery policies. The results show that overexploitation is unavoidable in near-shore waters because of the lack of enforcement of fishery regulations for offshore vessels and the limitation of alternative sources of income and opportunities for livelihood diversification for small-scale fishers. The present policies to prevent overexploitation need to be reconciled with livelihood sustainability and fishery management, resource conservation and socioeconomic goals Crown","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2012.06.021","journal":null,"aid":238}

Current forest allocation and subcontracting policies of the Vietnamese government with respect to the devolution of forest management and participation of local people in sustainable forest management reflect both environmental and economic concerns. The paper aims at investigating how the devolution of rights over forestland and benefit sharing mechanisms are related to actual rights and the distribution of benefits of forest management practices. The findings show that farmer's decision-making over mangroves is very much influenced by shrimp farming since the income from mangroves is very low compared to that from shrimp. Farmer's decision making over forest is very much influenced by the way in which the benefit sharing policy is implemented by the state-owned forestry companies and management boards. However, their attitudes towards mangrove plantation and protection are far from negative. The study supports the claim that shrimp farmers may well be able to plant, protect and manage mangroves if they have more rights and responsibilities over forests and are able to benefit more from the production of mangroves. In this way more sustainable management of mangrove forests may be promoted.","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.07.034","journal":null,"aid":241}

Assurances that protected areas will provide such benefits are often crucial to attracting the support needed for their creation. But delivering on these promises is seldom easy. In some cases this may mean broadening the scope of benefits delivered by protected areas without undermining what they were set up for in the first place, no simple task. Unless we understand and publicise the full range of benefits from protected areas we risk not only reducing the chances of new protected areas being created but even of seeing some existing protected areas being degazetted and their values lost. This report, the fourth volume in WWF's Arguments for Protection series, looks at the role of protected areas in poverty reduction, in its widest sense. We focus mainly on the poorest countries and on poor communities within those countries. A few examples look at regional development and some also compare the impacts of protected areas in the materially richer countries. Specifically the report seeks to review five linked questions: 񮽙 What is the range of benefits that protected areas can offer? 񮽙 How do these benefits link to poverty reduction strategies? 񮽙 What is the evidence, if any, of protected areas reducing poverty and increasing well-being? 񮽙 What are the prerequisites for protected areas to contribute to poverty reduction? 񮽙 How do the benefits reach the poorest people, if at all? Efforts to align protected areas and poverty reduction have continued for some time and have a mixed history; while some social programmes associated with protected areas have worked well there have also been plenty of failures. Meanwhile the political pressure to show that conservation and poverty reduction can co-exist is growing and some governments are questioning commitments to protection in the face of present economic or social pressures. As investors seek more guarantees or predictability of joint socio-economic and conservation success, implementing agencies are – rightly – being held more accountable for results. The concept of 'protected area' is defined and different management approaches and governance types are described. Protected areas usually have to compete with other demands on land or water. Changing political expectations mean that many stakeholders expect to have a say about whether a protected area is created or not and designation often depends on a complex process of negotiation, trade offs and agreements. To support claims that protected areas can reduce poverty, it is important to have clear definitions of what we mean by 'poverty', 'poverty reduction' and 'well-being'. We review many different definitions, including those from the World Bank, UK Department for International Development (DFID), World Health Organisation, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Summit on Sustainable Development. For the purposes of this report, based on definitions from the OECD and DFID, we recognise five fundamental dimensions of well-being, any improvement in which should contribute to reducing poverty: 񮽙 Subsistence: non-economic benefits that contribute to well-being, i.e. health, nutrition, clean water and shelter 񮽙 Economic: benefits which provide the ability to earn an income, to consume and to have assets 񮽙 Cultural and spiritual: pride in community, confidence, living culture, spiritual freedom, education 񮽙 Environmental services: role in environmental stability and provision of natural resources 񮽙 Political: relating to issues of governance and thus influence in decision-making processes The different types of relationship between local people and protected areas are described, ranging from 'winwin' to 'lose-lose'. We consider whether protected areas can help to reduce poverty, first from the rather narrow perspective of poverty as defined by the World Bank and applied within the Millennium Development Goals (less than one dollar a day) by assessing the economic benefits of protected areas, then by looking at wider definitions of poverty as defined above. The sometimes chequered history of protected areas and local communities is considered as well, looking at poverty reduction in particular. A collection of short examples of economic benefits from protected areas are given in table form. We distinguish between direct and compensatory benefits from protected areas: i.e. benefits that arise because of the intrinsic values of the protected area itself and those that come because governments or others introduce compensation packages for people displaced by or losing resources to protected areas. The different types of values and benefits which protected area can provide in theory and practice (which is not necessarily the same thing) are also described in turn: food and drink, cultural and spiritual values, health and recreation, knowledge, environmental benefits, materials and homeland. Next we use data from work by WWF and others on management effectiveness of protected areas. WWF has carried out over 400 assessments of protected areas, using a simple questionnaire-type tracking tool, and has also assessed over 40 national protected area systems with another rapid assessment system. Both can be used to identify a group of protected areas where managers believe protection has also resulted in better conditions for local communities. WWF is also a major sponsor of a global study of management effectiveness in protected areas coordinated by the University of Queensland, which is assessing several thousand assessments. The combination of these data gives us two things: the largest body of statistical information on management effectiveness of protected areas available to date and a means of identifying a range of protected areas worth looking at in more detail. In addition, we developed our own simple assessment tool, the Protected Area Benefits Assessment Tool, and have used this to help to draw together information for this report and for a series of case studies. Case studies, which look at the issues discussed in the report in greater detail, come from Argentina, Finland, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Poland and Tanzania.

Its Bedouin Support Programme component is designed to provide tangible benefits to the Protec-torate's inhabitants as a means of building their support for, and participation in, the project's conservation initiatives. This paper discusses the process by which the objectives and work plan of the Bedouin Support Programme were established. A gender-balanced nine-person field team, composed of mainland Egyptian and expatriate social scientists and a local Bedouin, conducted extensive discussions with representatives of all tribal groups living within the Protectorate. Bedouins called for assistance in the creation of jobs and income-generating activities, improvement of water supplies, reversal of trends in environmental deterioration , involvement with tourism, and access to health and educational services. They made numerous suggestions for conservation-related activities in which they could participate, including wildlife protection and remote park facility operations. The team then consulted companies and government agencies which would be impacted by, or involved in, the Protectorate's Bedouin-related activities. Using these Bedouin and non-Bedouin perspectives, the team then developed a work plan for Bedouin Support Programme activities, seeking to further Bedouin interests in the areas of natural resource conservation, employment and income generation, the operation of remote park facilities, tourism, training, animal and human health, agriculture, and infrastructure.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Source: Mountain Research and Development RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":291}

They play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of the coastal environment , acting as sources of nutrients to adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems through active and passive transport. We examined the nutrient contents in mangrove and nonmangrove soils in and around the Bhitarkanika National Park, India and assessed whether the local agricultural producers were aware of and placed a value on this contribution of mangrove forests in enhancing agroecosystem productivity. Soil samples from both mangrove and nonmangrove areas were analysed and quantity of organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium were derived. The replacement cost method was used to derive the value of nutrients in mangrove soils. We estimated that each hectare of mangrove contains additional nutrients worth US$232.49 in comparison to nonmangrove areas. The difference in nutrient content in mangrove versus nonmangrove areas gave the value of US$3.37 million for the nutrients in 145 km 2 of mangrove forests. The agricultural producers were aware that mangrove forests act as a source of nutrients and were willing to pay a higher price for the land adjoining mangrove forests. Around 92% of the producers ranked nutrient retention as a secondary function of mangrove forests. Despite crop depredation from wild ungulates and conflict with salt water crocodiles the agricultur-ist finds the benefit to cost ratio of mangrove forests high and more than 76% were in favour of mangrove restoration. This study provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of mangrove ecosystems to the livelihoods of the local people and the urgent need to sustain these through proper policy and market interventions.","doi":"10.1007/s11273-008-9080-z","journal":null,"aid":315}

This paper quantifies the value of provisioning services of mangrove forests to local livelihoods in terms of forestry and fishery products. To examine the use of mangrove products, 324 households from 36 villages in the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area located in East Coast of India were surveyed using structured questionnaires. For estimating the contribution of mangrove forests to fish productivity, fish production was evaluated in three stages—inshore fishery, offshore fishery and the role of mangrove forests as nursery ground for fish and shellfish. The findings revealed that 14.2% of the fuel need of each household was being met by the forests. Other forestry products used were timber, honey and thatch grass. During the study, 14 species of fish and three of shellfish were recorded. The total catch for inshore fishery was estimated as 3.77 kg h-1 having market price of US$ 2.25. In offshore fishery the number of species caught as well as income from the catch was higher in areas with mangroves (US$ 44.61 h-1) than in those without mangroves (US$ 2.62 h-1). The market price of the forestry and fishery products used by the people was estimated as US$ 107 household-1 annum-1. The resources extracted from mangrove forests contributed to more than 14.5% of the total income of the household. This was around 30% for the households residing in the immediate vicinity of the forests. This study suggests that provisioning services provided by the mangrove forests are of significant importance to the coastal communities as they increase the resilience and sustainability of the local economy.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":314}

Understanding the impacts of conflict on livelihoods and conservation activities is paramount in Goma. The main reasons for resource degradation here are heightened insecurity, theft, and uncertainty, which limit the use of far off land for agriculture. Consequently, most people depended on forest products and fish from protected areas, thereby causing higher risks of depletion of fish and park resources. High population density, few livelihoods alternatives, unpredictability, and weak state apparatus remain serious issues to be considered in resource conservation. La dépendance aux ressources naturelles : les défis d'après-conflit pour la sécurité des moyens d'existence et pour la durabilité environnementale a ` Goma, République Démocra-tique du Congo La haute dépendance aux ressources naturelles a ` Goma pendant la période après-conflit a provo-qué des dégâts sévères au Parc National de Virunga (VNP) et au Lac Kivu. Il est de la plus haute importance que l'on comprenne les effets du conflit sur les moyens d'existence et sur les activités e ´cologiques a ` Goma. Les causes principales de la diminution des ressources dans cette région sont une augmentation de l'insécurité, des vols, et l'incertitude ; ces facteurs réduisent l'exploitation de terres lointaines pour l'agriculture. Par conséquent, la plupart des gens comptaient sur ce qu'ils trouvaient dans les forêts et sur les poissons pêchés dans les zones protégées, ce qui a mené un risque e ´levé de diminution des ressources aquatiques et territoriales au parc national. La densité de la population, le manque d'autres moyens d'existence, l'imprévisibilité et la faiblesse de l'appareil de l'Etat restent des questions primordiales pour la protection des ressources.

Resulta de fundamental importancia comprender los impactos que los conflictos producen en los medios de sustento y en las actividades de conservación en Goma. La creciente inseguridad, el robo y la incertidumbre constituyen las razones principales de la degradación de los recursos debido a que inhiben el uso de tierras lejanas para la agricultura. En consecuencia, la mayoría de las personas depende de pro-ductos forestales y de la pesca en a ´reas protegidas, situación que provoca el aumento del riesgo tanto del agotamiento de peces como de los recursos del parque.

It is widely recognized that the lives of humans and wildlife in this region are inextricably intertwined. However, few studies have attempted to integrate both human and wildlife dimensions using ethnographic data to better contextualize the trade and its ecological impacts. This paper outlines a methodological approach that combines ethnographic research, ecological line transects and market surveys in the Dzanga Sangha Reserve (Central African Republic). Results from each research component are reported separately in order to provide examples of how each would answer specific questions about the status of wildlife populations and the scale of hunting within a protected area. The integrated analysis of ethnographic, market and ecological datasets clarifies synergistic impacts operating in the region and provides a more nuanced understanding of changes in both the forest and the market based on information gleaned from hunting practices and hunter interviews. This research demonstrates the potential pitfalls of using a singular approach to make recommendations on complex human-environment issues. Such cross-disciplinary mixed-methods approaches will further understandings of dynamic wildlife populations and forge more informed environmental policy recommendations.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":349}

The study employed focus group meetings, in-depth interviews, and interviews of households, as stratified by wealth class and head of household gender in Copperbelt, Zambia. The results show that FPES are vitally important in providing food, medicine, fodder, and construction materials to rural livelihoods. FPES provided 43.9 % of the average household's income and contributed a 10 % income equalisation effect among households, as revealed by the Gini-coefficient analysis. Poorer households received a lower mean annual income from forests than did their intermediate and wealthy counterparts, but in relative terms, forest income made the greatest contribution to the total household incomes of poor households. When stratified by gender, forests contributed 44.4 and 41.8 % of the income of male-and female-headed households, respectively.

The inter-and intra-community differentiation in the use and sale of FPES, as revealed in this study, enables more effective targeting of forest management interventions and informs efforts to reconcile the goals of poverty reduction and forest conservation.","doi":"10.1007/s11111-013-0189-5","journal":{"name":"Popul Environ","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":354}

K. and Karanth","dAbstract":"Previous research indicates that numbers of visits to protected areas (PAs) are declining in wealthy countries while foreign visitation is increasing in less-wealthy countries. We focus on India to discern trends and implications of nature-based tourism in an emerging economy. We interviewed 91% of tourist facilities around 10 PAs to assess visitation, employment, and practices. Average growth rate was 14.9% (from −7% in Bandipur to 44% in Periyar from 2002 to 2008) and 80% are domestic tourists. Many facilities (72% post 2000) are recently constructed and 85% occur within 5 km of PAs. Clustering of facilities in some PAs might facilitate easier management of resource use and establishment of best practice guidelines. Contributions of facilities to local employment are marginal. Rules governing entry of people and vehicles vary widely. Domestic nature-based tourism potentially generates public support for conservation but adds to existing challenges of managing PAs already facing pressure from livelihood needs of local populations. Based on these trends, the increasing middle class in India is likely to generate future demand for nature-based tourism counter to trends in industrialized countries. There is urgent need for establishing and enforcing regulations to manage tourists, resource use, and land-use change around PAs.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":942}

Zagros forests cover 6.07 million ha and support rich plant and animal diversity. Changes in local community social and economic systems and the inefficiency of traditional forest management led to a critical situation in the stability of forest regeneration in recent decades. Due to a shortage of productive and arable lands and resulting unemployment and poverty, people overexploited the Zagros forests. Outside intervention in traditional forest management creates conflicts between local peoples and forest management organizations. To achieve sustainable forest management, including forest resources conservation and improvement of natural resource based livelihoods of communities, it is desirable to implement Forestry Incentive Programs (FIP) based on the important functions of forests. Detailed information on the so-cio-economics of communities, the effect of forests on local livelihoods, and lists of products extracted from the forest were obtained from a survey of local communities though questionnaire, interview and observation. We studied 276 households in three villages and completed 76 questionnaires by householders in the quantitative analysis. Sampling was performed by simple random sampling (SRS). The needs of rural communities , such as livestock husbandry, mainly arise from the characteristics and environmental features of villages. We identified the driving forces, pressures, status, impacts and responses (DPSIR) to design incentive programs, by DPSIR analysis and interaction analysis. Evaluation of local community benefits from forests showed that in order to improve forest management, 319 dollars per year would be needed by each family as an incentive in 2010 to prevent lopping and firewood collecting, the main causes of forest degradation.","doi":"10.1007/s11676-013-0399-9","journal":{"name":"Journal of Forestry Research","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":385}

We analyzed the effects on livelihood capitals to compare in two ways: (1) before and after participation, and (2) participants and non-participants. In Cox's Bazar, there were some significant changes regarding income sources, but annual income was little changed after participation in participatory forestry. Literacy (about 10 % after participation) and mobile phone ownership (75 %) were significantly higher than before. Housing conditions were better (brick walls: 7.5 %; sun-grass roof: 70 %) than those of non-participants (brick walls: 0 %; sun-grass roof: 77.5 %). PF ensured legal rights on forest lands for participants, while non-participants were illegally living on public forestland. However, expenses were considerably higher than income; people were still struggling with poverty and many of them suffered from malnutrition. This ultimately put pressure on all capital. People had redistributed their available capital to cope with adversity, and there was a trend toward involvement in economic activities other than forests. Our study found that social capital was more influenced by PF more than other capitals. Due to the involvement with the PF program, people were feeling much more secure, women had elevated status, and social relationships became stronger.","doi":"10.1007/s10310-013-0403-4","journal":null,"aid":391}

A total of one hundred and sixty species distributed both in forest reserve and general land were recorded. Local end-uses of NTFPs including fuel wood, food, construction materials, medicine and traditional rites items were identified. This indicated significant contribution of NTFPs to local community income and livelihood resilience and thus, incentive for sustainable forest management. While access to NTFP is important to guarantee the socioeconomic well being of the forest adjacent communities, their sustainable management has not been taken seriously by local government officials and policy makers thereby contributing to reduction of biodiversity resources and irretrievable loss of most species.

B. and Rose G. and Mahudi H.","dAbstract":"This study examined the perceptions of fishers from two fishing communities with differing use histories and involvement in the long-standing (16 yr) multiple use Mafia Island marine protected area (MIMP), Tanzania. A randomly distributed questionnaire indicated that 94% of fishers believed that without the MIMP, there would be overfishing, dynamite use, destroyed habitats, and few fish. Fishers were more positive about core zones (no-take fishery closures) than general use zones (areas allowing selective fishing) as a consequence of increases in fishing pressure. Those that reported increased catches and sizes of fish since the creation of the MIMP were more likely to agree with present zone locations and more positive in general about fisheries and conservation planning. Most thought that fish size and gear restrictions were preferable to permanent closures. Perceptions differed among communities and gear users. Community and gear type explained 46% of the variance in responses about the perception that fisheries and conservation are compatible goals. Somewhat surprisingly, these effects were more important than catch increases or involvement in MIMP-related activities. The differences in perception between communities may be partly attributed to different fishing histories. Multiple-use zoning provides a means to identify and resolve conflicts and achieve what are likely universal objectives for fisheries sustainability and conservation.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2013.06.005","journal":null,"aid":26}

Ninety members of local communities bordering Manyeleti Game Reserve, which is contiguous with Kruger National Park, South Africa were interviewed. Respondents expressed diverging attitudes toward predators, which were more favorable among participants with higher education. Negative views were particularly due to fear of human and livestock losses, especially to lions, Panthera leo. Lions were thought to be the most abundant predator both within and outside the reserve. Lions were also the best known predator and were most often held responsible for killing livestock. Despite these livestock losses and a lack of conservation education, most participants voiced favorable opinions about large carnivore conservation, as predators were considered an integral part of the respondents' natural heritage. Thanks to this cultural tolerance and also because of a largely accepted management policy regarding predator control, large carnivores and people can coexist in the vicinity of Kruger National Park.","doi":"10.1007/s00267-008-9204-5","journal":null,"aid":413}

{"filename":"Le et al. 2014","year":2014,"title":"What drives the success of reforestation projects in tropical developing countries? The case of the Philippines","authors":"Le H. D. and Smith C. and Herbohn J.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction While tropical deforestation continues at alarmingly high rates, the net loss of forest area globally has slowed from 8.3 million ha per year between 1990 and 2000 to 5.2 million ha per year between 2000 and 2010 (FAO, 2010). This reduction in net loss is mainly due to an increase in afforestation, reforestation, and natural forest regrowth. It appears that a number of tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, whereby there has been a shift from deforestation to net reforestation (Meyfroidt and Lambin, 2011). Reforestation through planting trees on cleared land is an important mechanism that leads to tree cover establishment as reported in the forest transition literature, however reforestation is not a straightforward process that leads invariably to tree cover increase (de Jong, 2010 ). Rather, the outcome of forest rehabilitation itself is influenced by many factors (Chokkalingam et al., 2005; Le et al., 2012). If forest rehabilitation outcomes can be appropriately assessed, and these outcomes linked to forest cover increases, the study of forest rehabilitation could shed light on some of the many complex processes that ultimately result in forest transition (de Jong, 2010). Little information exists to indicate the success of reforestation projects in achieving ecological or socio-economic benefits. Unfortunately, many existing reforestation projects have partially or completely failed, often because the trees that were planted have not survived or have been rapidly destroyed by the same pressures that caused forest loss in the first place. Even when planted trees have survived to maturity, they have not necessarily been welcomed by local communities. Dudley et al. (2005:6) observed that, 'too many restoration projects do not bother to find out what local people really want'. This is a particular problem in the rural areas of developing countries because if reforestation projects do not meet community livelihood needs, then the planted trees will not be respected and will most likely be removed and replaced with agricultural land uses. A number of problems with past reforestation projects can be identified. Reforestation projects have often sought to encourage and sometimes impose tree planting without understanding why the trees disappeared in the first place and without attempting to address the immediate or underlying causes of forest loss (Eckholm, 1979). There has also often been a mismatch between social and ecological goals of reforestation; either reforestation has aimed to fulfil social or economic needs without reference to ecological goals, or it has had a narrow conservation aim without taking into account the social and economic needs of people. For foresters, reforestation traditionally meant establishing trees for a number of functions (wood or pulp production, soil protection). For many conservationists, reforestation is either about restoring original forest cover on degraded areas or about planting corridors of forest to link protected areas. For many interested in social development, the emphasis of reforestation is on establishing trees that are useful for fuel-wood, fruit, or as windbreaks and livestock enclosures. Until now, most reforestation practitioners and ecologists have tended to see their jobs as strictly technical. In reality, however, reforestation is as much a cultural activity as any other human endeavour. As Higgs (1997) has compellingly argued, good reforestation requires a view expanded beyond the technical to include historical, social, cultural, political, aesthetic and moral aspects. Otherwise conflicts may arise when reforestation programs are introduced (Light and Higgs, 1996; Swart et al., 2001). Based on a variety of case studies, the most important socioeconomic requirements for reforestation success appear to be a stable land-use pattern, equitable land-tenure systems, homogeneous human populations (with respect to ethnicity, economics, and so forth), local public involvement, and strong local leadership and participation by government institutions (Karki, 1991; Lamb, 1988). However, the success or failure of reforestation projects cannot be explained by either a single technical or a socioeconomic factor (Aronson et al., 1993; Le et al., 2012; Sayer et al., 2004). Little quantitative research has been conducted on reforestation success drivers and their interactions. Through a comprehensive review of the literature we have identified a list of potential success drivers and grouped these into technical/biophysical drivers; socio-economic drivers; institutional , policy and management drivers; and reforestation project characteristics (Le et al., 2012). In that study, we also identified a large set of indicators that have been used to measure the success of reforestation projects (Fig. 1). A critical shortcoming in our current understanding concerns the relationships between the drivers of reforestation success and the indicators. In some cases these links are relatively clear, for example weed control and grazing management are logical drivers that would affect seedling survival rate (a key indicator of reforestation success). However in many other cases, the links are not clear and there may be many drivers that affect the outcomes of reforestation in unknown or unexpected ways. We also do not know the relative importance of the many potential drivers, nor their impact on one or more indicators of success. In addition, we do not know what the interactions are between drivers and/or indicators. The aim of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of these relationships by investigating the drivers that have determined reforestation success in the Philippines. We do this by surveying 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, covering 98 potential drivers and 12 success indicators.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":419}

F.","dAbstract":"How users perceive the performance of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is fundamental for the social acceptance of these zones. Moreover, their perceptions may be relevant for monitoring the effects of MPAs on extractive activities. This study analyzes artisanal fishers' perceptions of the performance of a northwestern Mediterranean coastal MPA, which encompasses two no-take zones (NTZs). Three viewpoints have been considered: the effect on the personal activity of fishers, the effect on the local fishery and the effect on the ecosystem. In order to test the hypothesis that biomass export (spillover) – which had previously been evidenced from the two NTZs – may influence fishers' perceptions of NTZ effects, fishers' perceptions were compared with both declared and observed fishing activity over an one-year period. The results show that negative perceptions of NTZs are either nil or are negligible. Most fishers are aware of the beneficial effects of NTZs on ecosystems and fisheries. However, they remain to be convinced of the beneficial effects of the NTZs on their own activity. For instance, the proximity of a NTZ appears never to be involved in the choice of a fishing spot. This partial lack of correspondence between scientific expectation and fishers' perceptions is discussed in the light of fishing habits in the zone adjacent to NTZs, and takes into account fishing grounds, targeted species and seniority (defined as the number of years the fisher has been fishing within the MPA). All three factors appear to influence fishers' perceptions. For example, having a positive perception about a NTZ and spending more time fishing in the adjacent zone are habits that can be associated with fishers with less seniority. Fishers' perceptions obviously indicate the social acceptance of the MPA and are an essential monitoring tool for MPA managers. However, perceptions cannot be seen as a substitute for scientific monitoring, as both approaches are clearly complementary.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2011.06.002","journal":null,"aid":954}

P.","dAbstract":"Forest cover in Sri Lanka has decreased rapidly during the last century and only fragments of the once widespread natural forest cover remain. This paper analyzes forest cover change and small scale farmers' relation to natural forests around two protected forest areas in Sri Lanka; Kanneliya Forest Reserve and Knuckles Conservation Forest. Methods used are spatial analysis to observe changes in forest cover from the 1980s until 2010, interviews with small scale farmers and key informants as well as field observations. In Kanneliya Forest Reserve, a decrease in forest cover is observed, particularly due to population increase and expanding tea plantations. In Knuckles Conservation Forest on the other hand, we find an overall increase in forest cover due to expansion of tree plantations, a ban on shifting cultivation and emigration from the area followed by natural forest regeneration. Agriculture is the most common source of income in both study areas and there is a clear link between conversions of forests to agricultural expansion. The profits from agricultural activities are in general insufficient to sustain small scale farmers' needs and the most common alternative source of income is achieved through resources extracted from the forest. Since 2001, demarcation of forest boundaries around the two forest reserves has reduced encroachment and illegal felling of timber. However, this policy has simultaneously threatened the livelihoods of peripheral communities in the forest buffer zones, especially in the investigated villages around Knuckles Conservation Forest. Despite successful attempts to reduce deforestation rates through governmental interventions, further incorporation of local people into the management of forests as stipulated in the current forest policy should be continued.","doi":"10.1016/j.apgeog.2012.04.011","journal":null,"aid":961}

This paper analyses the strategies of adjustment implemented by members of two flood-prone communities in Puerto Rico, and discusses how the adoption of these strategies and other factors could influence future adaptive capacity and vulnerability to floods. Semi-structured interviews with community members from different resource endowment groups were used to elicit the resources behind the process of adjustment along with additional factors that could influence future adaptive capacity, including their perceptions of risks related to floods. The analysis revealed how access to resources – including material, economic and human resources – has facilitated living with floods in these communities; although not everyone has been able to adapt in the same way. Past actions, along with public responses being undertaken in the area (i.e. flood control project and upstream structural modifications) appear to be reducing flood-risk perceptions and promoting a false sense of security among community members, irrespective of resource endowment group. For that reason, developing ways to increase awareness about future flood potential and making clear the need for complementary non-structural strategies is imperative. In short, the research findings emphasise that access to resources and cognitive factors are important determinants of adaptive capacity. Hence, both should be taken into account while developing practical strategies towards increasing adaptive capacity and reducing vulnerability to floods specifically, and to other natural hazards in general.","doi":"10.1111/j.1475-4959.2010.00353.x","journal":null,"aid":965}

There is an often implicit assumption that PGIS use is effective, in that it meets content needs, satisfies underlying local stakeholder interests and therefore is a tool for better governance. The analytical framework looks at participatory spatial planning performance with respect to key dimensions of governance, especially the intensity of community participation and empowerment, equity within communities and between 'governed' and 'governing', respect for indigenous knowledge, rights, ownership, legitimacy, and effectiveness. Specific development focus is given by a case study using participatory mapping and PGIS in community forest legitimization, planning and management in Tinto, Cameroon. 'Good governance' criteria are applied ex-post to the implementation procedures, the geo-information outputs, and the longer-term outcomes of the PGIS processes. Impacts of incorporating PGIS were examined in terms of the types and degrees of participation in the process; access to, and the uses made of, the geographic information; whether the information outputs met stakeholders' requirements; and the overall changes in equity and empowerment in the community. It was found that PGIS/participatory mapping processes contributed – positively, though not comprehensively – to good governance, by improving dialogue, redistributing resource access and control rights – though not always equitably – legitimizing and using local knowledge, exposing local stakeholders to geospatial analysis, and creating some actor empowerment through training. PGIS promoted empowerment by supporting community members' participation in decision-making and actions, and by enabling land use planning decisions beyond community forestry itself.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"The Geographical Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":488}

Respondents thought that wildlife was important but were nonetheless tolerant of several forms of environmental exploitation. Visits by conservation organizations , Conservation International and Foster Parrots, were shown to increase appreciation of wildlife and the need to set up more protected areas, but unless programmes were concentrated and sustained they had little effect on attitudes towards environmental utilization and exploitation. Experience of the natural world in terms of owning a domestic animal or pet, having visited a zoo, or being a member of a wildlife club had little impact on children's knowledge of wildlife and did not change attitudes to utilization and exploitation. Surprisingly, Guyanese children did not have particularly positive views about classic flagship species, such as jaguars, giant anteaters and tapirs, when compared to other species. Our findings suggest that zoos, wildlife clubs and conservation organizations could enhance the dissemination of their message through making more frequent and sustained visits, imparting more detailed knowledge, and exposing children to the potential dangers of utilization and exploitation; also that conservation organizations should reassess their use of standard flagship species in South America.","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2008.12.021","journal":null,"aid":552}

They include the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP), and the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjing (DCBT). While there have been studies of these programs, many questions remain to be examined concerning why the programs have been initiated, whether they have been effectively implemented, what their induced socioeconomic and ecological impacts are, and how their performance can be improved. To address these overarching questions, my colleagues from the Forest Economics and Development Research Center (FEDRC) of the Chinese State Forestry Administration and Michigan State University (MSU) and I organized an international symposium in Beijing, on October 19, 2007. It included invited speeches and panel discussions as well as refereed presentations, many of which featured ongoing research projects undertaken by scholars from MSU, FEDRC, and their partners. After the symposium, I decided to edit a book based on the conference presentations , and the presenters and their associates have worked hard to prepare their manuscripts for the book in a timely manner. Our consensus was that getting these papers quickly published in a single volume would highlight the research advances in assessing China's ecological restoration programs and thus provide a major source of literature, conceptual frameworks, models, and tools for continued assessment of the programs, particularly integrated assessment of the socioeconomic and environmental impacts. If time proves that this book has indeed made a valuable contribution in this regard, then our intention will have realized, for which my colleagues and I will be grateful. As its editor, I will take responsibility for any not so well articulated or elaborated arguments and language errors. The book, containing 14 chapters, addresses a wide range of issues. It begins with an up-to-date description of China's ecological restoration programs (ERPs, Chapter 1 ) and an extensive survey of the literature that has assessed the implementation efficacy and impact significance of these programs (Chapter 2). Then it presents the research methodology of integrative assessment that my collaborators and I have adopted (Chapter 3) and a case study of detecting the land use and land cover changes (LUCC) induced by implementing the programs (Chapter 4). Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted to modeling the driving forces of the historical LUCC in the upper Yangtze. Chapters 7 and 8 are attempts to quantify the potential ecological impacts on carbon dynamics and soil erosion. The remaining chapters are efforts to estimate the socioeconomic impacts of the programs, as reflected in income, employment, and other dimensions of livelihoods. In describing China's ERPs, Chapter 1 covers their initiation, implementation, and challenges. Overall, it appears that with the substantial government investment, tremendous progress has been made in implementing the ERPs. For instance, the forest area and volume have expanded significantly with the implementation of the NFPP. Similarly, under the SLCP a large amount of degraded farmland and grassland has been rehabilitated, and the forest and grass coverage has expanded substantially. As a result, the ecological and socioeconomic conditions have seen improvement. To complete their implementation successfully and to fundamentally improve the ecosystem functions and services, however, the authors argue that it is essential for China to embrace a more balanced and comprehensive approach to ecological restoration, adopt better planning and management practices , emphasize local people's active engagement, strengthen the governance of project implementation, establish an independent and competent monitoring network , and conduct timely and high-quality assessments of the program effectiveness and impacts. In addition to reviewing the literature on assessing the implementation efficacy and impact significance of the ERPs, Chapter 2 also outlines several directions for future research. In a nutshell, it finds that: (1) the implementation effectiveness has not been examined as extensively as the impact significance; (2) efforts to assess the impact significance have concentrated on the SLCP, particularly its socioeconomic effects: growth of income, alternative industry, and employment, and likelihood of re-conversion; and (3) most of the socioeconomic studies are based on rural household surveys, and discrete choice and difference in differences models. Future work should thus pay more attention to the NFPP and other programs, and the environmental impacts and the implementation effectiveness of all of them. To these ends, the authors recommend that analysts gather more field data regarding the evolving ecosystem conditions and socioeconomic information of higher aggregation, and conduct their research across scales, with better application of geospatial technology and more effective collaboration. In presenting their research methodology of integrative assessment, the authors of Chapter 3 first call for embracing both environmental and socioeconomic changes and engaging investigations at multiple scales and through interdisciplinary collaboration with expertise from ecology, economics, hydrology, and geospatial, climate , and land change sciences. Echoing some of the recommendations made in Chapter 2, they further argue that the deployment of geospatial capability, the use of longitudinal data, and the connection between science and policy should be the hallmarks of an integrative assessment. Then, they outline their general approach and specific models to quantifying the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the ERPs, and to addressing the issue of how to overcome the challenges in generating the data needed for executing various empirical tasks. The authors hold Preface ix that the adoption and application of this methodology will lead to a more rigorous and systematic assessment as well as implementation of the ecological restoration programs in China. Chapter 4 reports the land cover changes in northeast China from the late 1970s to 2004. Even though land use statistics from governmental sources exist, their availability and reliability are not promising. Coupled with the fact that the geospatial technology is now not only well advanced but also cost effective, this led to the authors' decision to identify the regional LUCC using remote sensing and the Geographic Information System. Their results are very encouraging. It is found that while forestland and wetland were greatly reduced until 2000 due to farmland expansion and urbanization, spurred by the population and economic growth, their declining trends have been revered most recently. Meanwhile, built-up land has continued to increase. Further, the land cover changes occurred primarily in areas with low elevation and gentle slope. These findings suggest that the forest and wetland protection and restoration projects have indeed taken effect. However, the authors warn that there remains a long way to go before the ecosystems are greatly recovered and can function in the way that society expects. Chapters 5 and 6 are attempts to modeling the driving forces of the LUCC in the upper Yangtze basin, aiming to shed light on human impacts on the LUCC and environmental conditions. In Chapter 5, the authors use a fractional logit model to determine the effects of social, economic, and institutional factors on the changes of cropland, forestland, and grassland. Based on a panel dataset covering 31 counties over four time periods from 1975 to 2000, they show that population expansion, food self-sufficiency, and better market access drove cropland expansion, while industrial development contributed significantly to the increase of forestland and the decrease of other land uses. Similarly, stable tenure had a positive effect on forest protection. In addition to highlighting the main LUCC drivers, this chapter also illustrates the limitations of the conventional choice models. To gain a better knowledge of the complex interactions of human and natural drivers underlying the LUCC, Chapter 6 creates a system of simultaneous equations to capture the dynamic linkages, feedback , and endogeneity of the determinants. This novel structural model of land use focuses on the multiple dimensions of agriculture – not only cropland use itself, but also grain production, soil erosion, and related technical change. The results show that technical change plays an important role in supplying food on a limited cropland ; limiting cropland expansion in turn reduces soil erosion, which then benefits grain production in the longer term. It is also found that policies and institutions have significant impacts on land use change and the status of soil erosion. Together, these results carry some important implications for sustainable land use and ecosystem management. The alternative modeling strategies are beneficial to improved knowledge of the drivers. Chapters 7 and 8 are estimations of the changes in carbon storage and soil erosion based on ecosystem simulation models. Quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and carbon fluxes between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere is critical to understanding the regional patterns of carbon storage and loss. In Chapter 7, the authors use the General x Preface Ensemble Biogeochemical Modeling System to simulate the terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics in the Jinsha watershed of the upper Yangtze basin, based on a unique combination of spatial and temporal dynamics of such major factors as climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, and LUCC. It shows that the Jinsha watershed ecosystems acted as a carbon sink during the period of 1975–2000, with an average rate of 0.36 Mg/ha/yr, primarily resulting from regional climate variation and local LUCC. Vegetation biomass accumulation accounted for 90.6% of the sink. While soil organic carbon loss before 1992 led to a lower net gain of carbon in the watershed, soils became a small sink thereafter. The carbon sink/source pattern had a high degree of spatial heterogeneity, with sinks associated with forest areas without disturbances and sources caused by stand-replacing disturbances. This underlies the importance of land-use history in determining the regional carbon sink/source pattern. Land degradation caused by serious soil erosion has made the Loess Plateau one of the poorest regions in China. To improve the environmental conditions, the government has taken a number of measures there, including the SLCP. A natural question to ask thus is whether and to what extent it has actually accomplished the designed objective. Chapter 8 answers this question, concentrating on the soil erosion dynamics in the Zuli River basin. The authors do so by adopting a distributed soil erosion model to simulate the changes of water runoff and soil erosion induced by implementing the SLCP, with the assistance of remote sensing and GIS technologies for parameterization of the land surface attributes. Their simulations show that the improved ground cover, especially forestland and grassland, has resulted in an erosion reduction of 38.8%, compared to the mean level of the 1990s. On the other hand, the changed rainfall pattern has caused soil erosion to increase by 13.1%. In combination, the authors obtain a net decrease of soil erosion by 25.7% in recent years. This evidence suggests that China's ecological restoration efforts have effectively mitigated the regional water and soil loss. Chapters 9–14 constitute studies of the different socioeconomic impacts of the ERPs – with different sample sites, datasets, and modeling approaches. While most of these chapters feature various versions of the difference-in-differences (DID) model and panel data, one chapter estimates the aggregate NFPP impacts using an input-output model and another measures the agricultural productivity change induced by the SLCP. The authors of Chapter 9 note that the ERPs are often designed with dual goals: to enhance ecosystem services and to alleviate poverty; however, reaching both can be challenging. If the household's supply of ecosystem services is not positively correlated with poverty, tradeoffs may exist between meeting the two goals. Moreover, even if the supply of ecosystem services and poverty were positively correlated, cost-conscious program managers need to adopt targeting approaches such that the poorer households with land that is less costly to set aside and provides a higher environmental benefit are selected. To explore strategies by which both the environmental and poverty alleviation objectives of a program can be achieved cost effectively, they develop a conceptual framework to understand the implications of alternative targeting when policy makers have both environmental and poverty alleviation goals. Using the SLCP as a study case, Preface xi they then evaluate what factors determine the selection of program areas. Having demonstrated the heterogeneity of parcels and households, they examine the correlations across households and their parcels in terms of their potential environmental benefits, opportunity costs of participating, and the asset levels of households as an indicator of poverty. Finally, they compare alternative targeting criteria and simulate their performances in terms of cost effectiveness in meeting both the environmental and poverty alleviation goals when given a fixed budget. It is found that there is a substantial gain in the cost effectiveness of the program by targeting parcels based on the \" gold standard, \" – targeting parcels with low opportunity cost and high environmental benefit managed by poorer households. In Chapter 10, the authors hypothesize that in addition to participation status and household characteristics, the SLCP's impacts on income growth and labor transfer are determined by the local economic conditions, program extent, and political leadership; and the income impacts may vary from sector to sector. To test these propositions, they compiled a dataset of 600 households in three counties of the Loess Plateau region, with observations for times both prior to and after the program initiation (1999 and 2006), both aggregate and categorical incomes, and both participating and non-participating households. Using a simple DID model, they find that participation status, economic condition, program extent, and political leadership have all had significant impacts on household income and off-farm employment. Also, the effects of participation on crop production income, animal husbandry income, and off-farm income vary substantially. Obviously, these results have great policy meanings regarding how to improve the effectiveness and impacts of the ERP in China. In Chapter 11, the authors assess the impact of the NFPP on local household livelihoods. To that end, they apply a series of policy evaluation microeconometric techniques to quantify the program's effects on two interrelated facets of household livelihoods: income and off-farm labour supply. They find that the NFPP has had a negative impact on incomes from timber harvesting, due to logging restrictions. However, they show that off-farm labor supply has increased more rapidly in NFPP areas than in non-NFPP areas. As such, the NFPP has actually had a positive impact on total household incomes from all sources. Furthermore, this result is strongest for employment outside the village. On the basis of these results, the authors also offer an intriguing discussion concerning how to mitigate the negative impact of the program and strengthen its positive impact on household livelihoods. China's ecological restoration programs, which are sometimes referred to as \" the Priority Forestry Programs, \" or PFPs, also include the Wildlife Conservation and the Nature Reserve Development Program (WCNR) and the Shelterbelt Development Program (SBDP). In addition to improving the environmental and resource conditions, a frequently reiterated goal of these PFPs is to enhance the income of rural residents. Thus, a question of common interest is: How has implementing the PFPs affected the farmers' income and poverty status? The task of Chapter 12 is to address this question, using a fixed-effects model and panel data from over 2,100 households in ten counties of Sichuan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Jiangxi. The evidence indicates that their effects are mixed. The impacts of the SLCP, the NFPP, and the concerns and to improve its environmental conditions, China has been undertaking several major ecological restoration efforts (EREs), including the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP), the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), and the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjin (DCBT). These EREs represent large-scale, transformational changes and will have profound environmental and socioeconomic impacts both domestically and internationally (Forest and Grassland Taskforce of China, 2003;). A few studies have investigated the early implementation of these programs, their preliminary impacts, and the perceived problems in carrying them forward. For instance, was one of the earliest efforts that summarize the essentials, progress, and effects of the NFPP and SLCP. The authors also commented on the challenges facing the programs. Similarly, reported the implementation of these two programs, reviewed the patchy evidence of their effects, and suggested steps for improving their effectiveness, including systematic planning, diversified funding, effective compensation, integrated research, and comprehensive monitoring. In addition, presented a synopsis of these and other programs and then related them to the latest forest tenure reform and other policy initiatives of the Chinese government. Undoubtedly, China's experiences and lessons of ecological restoration are of broad interest and a lot has been learned of the NFPP and the SLCP from these and other studies. Nonetheless, China's EREs are not limited to the NFPP and the SLCP (), and a complete documentation and a timely updating of all the major efforts are still missing in the literature, which are not conducive to gauging the scope of these programs and the scale of their impacts. Additionally, a more thorough and critical deliberation of the relevant policy and technical measures remains urgently needed for improving the implementation of these programs. The purpose of this paper is to tackle these tasks and thereby to advance the international understanding and to facilitate the execution of China's EREs. Before proceeding, it should be noted that because of space limitation and potential diffusion of attention, we have decided not to review the literature that has assessed the socioeconomic and ecological impacts of the EREs here. 1 Furthermore , given that our tasks are to narrate the basic contents of the programs and their progress and to discuss the major issues encountered in their execution, a number of the statistics will be drawn from official sources and a largely descriptive analysis will suffice. The paper is organized as follows: In the remainder of this section, we will provide the historic background, against which China's EREs were launched; then, we will present their key elements and implementation in the next two sections; finally, we will address the critical issues that China faces in successfully completing these programs and fundamentally improving its ecosystem functions and services. After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, large tracts of primary natural forests remained in the northeast, southwest, and a few other places. Later, most of these forests were nationalized and 136 state-owned forest bureaus were gradually set up in these forests to produce timber to spur the young economy (SFA, 2001). Along with this strategy of resource exploitation, the old governance system came into play, under which the state enterprises lacked incentive and autonomy to manage and utilize the resources efficiently (Yin, 1998). Since logging was the main, or even the sole, revenue source and the forest bureaus had to assume the heavy burden of providing almost all of the social services for their workforce, over-cutting became prevalent and regeneration and management were neglected. At the same time, population growth and demand for employment in these forest regions led to more fuelwood consumption, housing construction, and land clearing . Consequently, China's natural forests were quickly depleted (Liu, 2002). The over-cutting and under-management also resulted in structural deterioration of the forests, as reflected in reduced stocking volume, imbalanced age structure, altered species composition, and low growth rate (Yin, 1998). Unfortunately, the ecological environment in the rural society was even worse. The collectivization in the 1950s discouraged people from tree-planting and forest management. Soon after, as part of the attempt to industrialize, a campaign to increase steel production took place during the Great Leap Forward. In many cases, even backyard furnaces fueled by wood charcoal were deployed for that purpose (Yin, 1994). Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, forest and grassland conversion to other uses was also carried out under the chronic crisis of grain shortages on the one hand and the national policy of food self-sufficiency on the other. These malpractices resulted in severe destruction of vegetation and deforestation. Also, farming on steep slopes became common due to demographic explosion and lapses in regulation (Du, 2001). Coupled with uneven rainfalls and rugged terrains, this led to a substantially reduced ecosystem capacity to regulate water flows and to contain soil erosion (Lu et al., 2002). These factors were deemed to be the primary reasons for the record dry-up of the Yellow River in 1997 and the widespread flooding in the Yangtze basin in 1998 (Xu & Cao, 2001). Another disaster has been the loss of grass cover and desertification in the west, driven by uncontrolled grazing, poor maintenance of rangeland, and human-induced decline of water tables (). To be sure, the Chinese government made attempts to combat the growing environmental problems in the past, but the record of their effectiveness was utterly disappointing. Since 1978, for instance, a number of afforestation projects has been launched ( ). Despite their broad geographic reach and remarkable planting efforts, public investments were limited, and the efforts were rarely followed through (Smil, 1993). Often, sites were poorly prepared, seeds and/or seedlings were not properly planted, and saplings were not well tended. Therefore, these forestry projects have failed miserably in delivering the expected environmental benefits. Similar problems have hindered the efforts to curb farming on slopes (Xu & Cao, 2001). In addition, having gained economic independence from the rural reforms, many farmers aggressively sought new croplands, just like herders hastily increased their livestock (Du, 2001). Oftentimes, this meant that a large number of the more sensitive patches on steeper slopes were claimed, and a great amount of the grassland in the arid and semi-arid regions was overgrazed. In short, the successive occurrences of ecological disasters in the late 1990s indicated that China's historic efforts to protect ecosystems had not improved the overall ecological conditions and more decisive and forceful measures are thus called for to bring the problems under control. It was against this backdrop that the new EREs were launched and the existing ones consolidated. The State Forestry Administration (hereafter, SFA), prompted by the ecological disasters and charged by the State Council, proposed the NFPP in 1998 as a large-scale scheme to protect most of the natural forests and, then, the SCLP in 1999 to convert croplands on slopes and desertified fields back to forestland, grassland, and wetland on an even larger scale. 2 Moreover, China has indeed been carrying out four other programs: the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjin, the Shelterbelt Network Development Program, the Wildlife Conservation and Nature Reserves Protection Program, and the Industrial Timberland Plantation Program (SFA, 2002). Altogether , they are designated by the SFA as the \" Six Priority Forestry Programs \" of ecological restoration and resource expansion and are incorporated into the national economic development and environmental protection plans (SFA, 2007;). 3 The Chinese government hopes that these programs will not only greatly improve the domestic resource and ecological conditions as well as rural livelihoods, but also significantly contribute to regional and global environmental causes ( ). The total investment in these programs over this decade will easily top 500 billion yuan (). 4","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":553}

It may not be possible, for example, to create or maintain employment and generate increasing volumes of revenue for government whilst also sustaining stocks and biodiversity. Two approaches to fisheries management, one focused on capturing wealth and limiting access and the other on maintaining access for employment and providing community development and welfare, present contrasting policy advice, with different points of emphases and objectives. This article examines the case of Lake Victoria, where the three main commercial fisheries are seen to contribute to different objectives for the lake's fisheries. Insights from the debate between wealth-based and welfare-based approaches to fisheries management provide a framework for the analysis of fisheries policy and practice on the lake. From the analysis, it is concluded that whilst there is much rhetoric in support of a wealth-based approach, this has not been followed through in implementation, reflecting the lack of political support for new taxation and limiting access. The welfare functions of the fisheries are significant, but could be substantially strengthened through greater investment in the provision of services to fisheries communities. The approaches are not mutually exclusive , but pursuing wealth-based management must support livelihoods, employment and development, as well as fisheries management objectives. Without the incorporation of welfare objectives, fisheries policies will not be politically accepted or fully implemented, suggesting the need for a balance between wealth and welfare objectives and measures.","doi":"10.1111/faf.12012","journal":null,"aid":589}

This study assessed the eviction process and its effects on the socio-ecological resilience of the evicted, examined coping strategies for the evicted and analysed socioeconomic factors that affected socio-ecological resilience of people evicted in 2008 for establishment of the Uluguru Nature Reserve in Morogoro, Tanzania. The results show that most of the evicted did not receive eviction notice prior to eviction nor proper training on how to cope with the eviction. There was also low involvement of the evicted in planning the eviction. Most of the evicted had low ability to reorganise themselves after the eviction. Following the eviction, the most frequently adopted coping strategy was the provision of casual labour. This resulted in reduced income and certainty of livelihood. Male respondents were better informed and better able to reorganise than female respondents. It is recommended that eviction planning should be participatory and include provision of appropriate prior information to the to-be evicted in a gender-considerate manner in order to enhance their socio-ecological resilience in the face of eviction.","doi":"10.1080/14728028.2013.810405","journal":null,"aid":1032}

B. and Baral M. and Ranjan","dAbstract":"A questionnaire survey covering 35% of all households in five villages was conducted in a local forest protection group in Orissa, India. The aim was to study dependency, involvement and attitude towards forest protection based on gender and caste. A conceptual model indicating differences between the groups was used as a base. Women experienced more problems of restrictions caused by the protection and more threats associated with the forest than did men. Voting in meetings and a wish for more plantations was of greater importance for women than for men, while men emphasised importance of cooperation with government. Direct involvement was very low among women, even though they were well informed about forest issues. Tribal groups were the main contributers of labour, while general caste had been involved for considerably longer in forest protection than other groups. The tribal groups also wanted more plantations and had a good understanding of the ecosystem. For example, they indicated the value of a growing forest. Men and general caste tended to be more outspoken in this type of questionnaire situation compared to women and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The general attitude towards Dhani Hill, however, was positive and could be linked to daily use and future optimism. This optimism and the involvement of all the different groups should be considered as crucial in the timing of local forest management interventions. This should be seen together with the diversified opinions and ways of expressing such opinions depending on gender and caste.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1038}

It has been proposed that different components of a common property resource (CPR) do not undergo degradation at the same rate, as they are not managed in the same way under different types of property rights regimes. To examine this, information was collected through a survey of 324 households, community resource assessment ranking and group discussion in a small mountain watershed of Nepal. The study analysed NTFP collection and management practices under government and community forest management systems, and impact of these practices on the status of forest and NTFPs. The analysis based on people's perception revealed that NTFPs were being depleted more rapidly than timber components in both types of forest. The pace of depletion was, however, considerably lower in community forests, as these forests were accessible only to the relevant forest user group members. Depletion of NTFPs was due primarily to the lack of proper institutional arrangements , including the lack of a comprehensive government policy framework, for sustainable use and management of NTFPs.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892903000286","journal":null,"aid":1044}

The tenure reform clarity and strengthening of tenure rights at community level through various CBFM programs in Nepal in the last few decades has enhanced opportunities for the rural people to benefit from forest-based enterprises. However, a key concerns as these programs have advanced over the years has been whether the poor benefit from them given their high dependence on the forests. To examine this question, 28 CBFE from Nepal's mid-hills and mountain districts were selected purposively from among forest user groups (FUGs) engaged in income-generating activities, varying in their size of membership, use of forest products and stage of growth. These CBFEs have been broadly categorised into FUGs, networks, cooperatives and companies. The contribution from enterprises to the household economy was found to be greatest from companies, followed by cooperatives and then networks. The effective practices of the CBFEs in increasing income benefits were found to include representation of the poor and marginalized groups in executive committees in the FUGs-based enterprises, targeted employment of the poorest in the collection of non-timber forest products and in processing units in networks, and enabling the poor to own share capital in cooperatives and companies. The common constraint across all these categories was found to be lack B. H.

It has been locally managed as a decentralized Integrated Conservation and Development Project since 2006, the first of its kind in Asia. Major international donor agencies sponsor programs to empower and strengthen the capacity of local communities to manage their natural resources, while concurrently improving livelihood opportunities. We surveyed 205 randomly selected households throughout the project area to assess the factors that influence household participation roles in management and management groups, and to evaluate how benefits from program involvement were distributed among the community. Overall, the distribution of benefits was unequal: households with higher level participation roles had increased access to financial credit and capacity development trainings. Social variables such as age, level of education among head of households, the highest level education among household adults, and household size predicted participation. The region is economically homogeneous; therefore, economic factors such as remittances, off-farm income and the quantity of landholdings or livestock did not predict household participation roles. Our results demonstrate the importance of targeting and empowering disadvantaged households in decentralized conservation programs, including educating members about the relationship between participation and equitable distribution of benefits.

The potential of these areas to contribute to the global conservation of biodiversity is significant, given that statutory protected areas alone will not suffice. Nevertheless, there is still inadequate support for private conservation areas, and further research on appropriate, flexible, and generally applicable incentive measures is necessary. We conducted 25 semistructured interviews with the owners of private conservation areas in the Little Karoo, South Africa, to examine landowner opinions of existing conservation policies and their relationships with the local conservation authority. We also assessed landowner preferences regarding conservation incentive measures. Landowners doubted the conservation authority's capacity to implement its stewardship program and were also discouraged by the bureaucracy of the program. The conservation authority was often viewed negatively, except where landowners had experienced personal contact from conservation staff or where strong social capital had formed among landowners. Landowners did not desire financial rewards for their conservation efforts, but sought recognition of their stewardship role and greater involvement from the conservation authority through personal contact. We conclude that conservation policies for private lands could benefit from the provision of extension services to landowners, promotion of formation of groups of landowners and other stakeholders, and public acknowledgment of the contributions private conservation areas make.

This paper demonstrates how the governance of nature through sedentarization, the creation of national parks as a mechanism of forestry conservation and the failure to endorse standard environmental safeguards in the creation of the Tchad-Cameroon pipeline project have led to the devastation of the livelihood of the indigenous pygmies. Simultaneously, by categorizing the Pygmies as a 'primitive other' despite the very dynamism of the concept of culture, the state of Cameroon has excluded them from the benefits of postmodernist development. I demonstrate that projects aimed at modernizing them, and achieving sustainability have instead accentuated their exclusion because of their presumed cultural isolation, led to their deep entrenchment in poverty and resulted in complete erasure. The failure of these projects is due to the clash between global and local perspectives and interests over the Western protectionism and nature aesthetics that underpin conservation and development schemes, and the government's failure to ensure that developers fulfill their obligations to affected communities, as well as the non-recognition of the multiplex relationships between hunter-gatherers and farmers that is based on cultural, historical and political ecology. Against this backdrop, development has thus, become a process of erasure in which the livelihood of the Pygmies has been balkanized and their cultural existence and identity, negated.","doi":"10.1007/s10708-011-9441-7","journal":null,"aid":613}

N.","dAbstract":"The present and future well-being of the world's forest dwelling populations depends on their ability to gain livelihood resources from their immediate environment. Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products has been promoted by conserva-tionists and development agencies as a feasible strategy for forest dwellers that does not compromise the resource base. Yet surveys of actual resource use suggest that for poorer resource-dependent communities without access to markets, non-timber forest products can only ever represent a safety-net activity and a supplementary income source. Others argue that resource availability, in terms of the diversity and productivity of the forest, is the key parameter in realizing a contribution of forest products to well-being. This paper examines the scope and heterogeneity of forest product use to reveal whether resource availability necessarily provides the context for significant contributions to well-being of forest dwellers. We present data from an area of tropical rainforest, close to Iquitos in Peru, which was previously shown to have high potential value. We find, through a census survey of households within a forest reserve area, that non-timber forest products provide only a relatively small portion of income and that only a small proportion of available products are actually commercialized , despite apparent market availability. We show that the low rates of commercialization can be explained by unequal access capital assets used for extraction, to natural resources themselves , and to product markets. They are also explained by the concentration of capital-poor households on subsistence gathering activities. The value of destructive uses of forests, both logging and agriculture, remain higher than returns from non-timber products. This research demonstrates that although non-timber forest products are an important livelihood source, market integration and commercialization is not everywhere an appropriate or realistic strategy.","doi":"10.1007/s10021-005-0154-y","journal":null,"aid":1060}

Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil, Camer-oon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unac-knowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation. Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on NTFP availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to light demanding species that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the potential for enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests.","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2011.04.037","journal":null,"aid":640}

However, research on cooperation has demonstrated that increased market access and income may strengthen or weaken cooperation. Because cooperation is essential for community resilience in small-scale societies, negative effects on people's well-being can be expected if increased NTFP trade reduces cooperation. To evaluate whether NTFP trade affected cooperation, we used household data (survey and systematic observations) to compare the frequency of cooperation in two communities of Brazilian Amazon Caboclos, one of which engaged in NTFP trade, while the other did not. Cooperation was less frequent in the community trading NTFPs, but neither household cash income nor household participation in NTFP exploitation was associated with cooperative behavior. Decreased frequency most likely derived from indirect effects of NTFP trade, such as less time to fish or socialize, or other outcomes observable only at the community level, such as income inequality, the influx of new residents and consequent population growth. Our results indicate that conservation and development projects based on NTFP trade may negatively impact social and economic well-being of local communities.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":641}

This paper outlines a methodological approach that combines ethnographic research, ecological line transects and market surveys in the Dzanga Sangha Reserve (Central African Republic). Results from each research component are reported separately in order to provide examples of how each would answer specific questions about the status of wildlife populations and the scale of hunting within a protected area. The integrated analysis of ethnographic, market and ecological datasets clarifies synergistic impacts operating in the region and provides a more nuanced understanding of changes in both the forest and the market based on information gleaned from hunting practices and hunter interviews. This research demonstrates the potential pitfalls of using a singular approach to make recommendations on complex human-environment issues. Such cross-disciplinary mixed-methods approaches will further understandings of dynamic wildlife populations and forge more informed environmental policy recommendations.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":349}

PES is a market-oriented approach to environmental management and conservation that attaches an economic value to the provision of environmental services, which is compensated through voluntary payments, in cash or in kind (e.g., Duncan 2006; Wunder 2005 ). Proponents of PES argue that these schemes will foster resource conservation as long as environmental service users are prepared to pay adequate compensation to secure services, and environmental service providers are incentivized to continue generating these services in return for compensation, rather than pursuing other income-generating activities that might degrade them (e.g., FAO 2011; Pagiola et al. 2005 ). In this way, PES schemes seek to create mechanisms to enable bargaining and transactions between environmental service users and providers that are in both parties' interests: in other words, internalizing what would otherwise be an externality (Pagiola 2008;). The concept of PES has attracted much attention for its potential application in addressing the pressing issues of ecosystem conservation and poverty alleviation in developing countries (e.g., Duncan 2006; FAO 2011; UNEP=IUCN 2007). Much of this attention is based on the premise that poor, and mostly rural, groups often inhabit crucial ecosystems, and that payments (especially in cash) for safeguarding ecosystems and environmental services can form important sources of income that may improve their livelihood strategies (FAO 2007; Grieg-Gran et al. 2005 Muradian et al. 2010; Porras et al. 2008; Rosa et al. 2003; Zilberman et al. 2008). Some authors have stressed the need to ensure that any benefits from PES are equitably distributed among low-income groups (Rosa et al. 2003), that compensation replaces or improves income earned from previous land uses (Farley et al. 2011), and that institutional arrangements are put in place to ensure these benefits accrue in practice (Gran et al. 2005; Vatn 2010). These concerns around equity have led to a consideration of the broader benefits of PES schemes beyond monetary payments, to security of land tenure (although this sometimes is a prerequisite for participation), improved internal organization, enhancement of social capital, and more effective natural resource management (Lee and Mahanty 2007; Muradian et al. 2010; Rosa et al. 2003; Wunder 2008). Nevertheless, much literature has treated PES as a technical-economic intervention whose effectiveness depends on the adequacy of project design, nature of implementation, institutional capacity building, and economic calculation and planning. What is missing from many of these analyses are the ways in which social relations and dynamics between stakeholders—and especially between poor rural communities providing environmental services and the downstream users or third","doi":"10.1080/08941920.2013.825037","journal":{"name":"Ecuador, Society & Natural Resources: An International Journal","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":643}

About half of FDCs (46%) surveyed are willing to participate in mangrove conservation through involvement in management as proprietors.

Bolivia, a land-locked country in the heart of South America, is extraordinary in many ways. With fewer than eight people per square kilometer , it is among the most sparsely populated countries in the New World tropics (FAO, 2001). Only the Guianas are less densely populated. Poverty in Bolivia is among the highest in South America, with over two thirds of the population classified as \" living in poverty \" (World Bank, 1996), demonstrating that an economy based on exploiting our natural resources has not provided adequately for our inhabitants. Roughly 55% of the Bolivian population is of indigenous heritage, which is the highest proportion of indigenous people in any South American country (Gonzalez, 1994). Large expanses of forest ecosystems remain intact, especially in northern Bolivia where many areas are uninhabited or sparsely populated by indigenous peoples, although probably a third to half of this forest cover has been exploited by selective cutting of valuable mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King). Along with Guyana, Bolivia has the lowest rate of forest loss among the Amazonian countries (FAO, 2001). In the northwestern part of Bolivia, Madidi National Park, the area where Eco Bolivia has focused most of its work, is an extraordinary area even within such a unique country. Madidi National Park covers 1.89 million hectares (4.725 million acres), which is roughly the size of New Jersey. It occupies part of the \" Tropical Andes \" biodiversity hotspot, considered by Myers et al. (2000) to be a \" hyper-hot \" candidate for conservation due to the exceptional number of endemic plants and animals found within it. The park covers several different ecosystem types, from 6,000 m (19,000 ft) tall glacial peaks and high altiplano, through grasslands, dry forests and cloud forests, and down into lowland rainforests and seasonally flooding savannahs at a mere 600 ft above sea level. With such great variety in altitude, rainfall, and topography, Madidi represents an area that is undeniably one of the most species rich terrains in the world, and may have the highest biodiversity of any protected area on the planet (Parker & Bailey, 1991). Madidi National Park also contains tremendous cultural diversity. In and around Madidi there are indigenous people of Quechua, Aymara, Tacana, Esse Ejja, Leco, Moseten, Chiman, and Araona origins. Each of these groups maintains a unique native language and has vastly differing traditions and knowledge arising out of many centuries inhabiting these lands. One of the goals I had in establishing the limits that I recommended for Madidi was to draw together other areas that, at least officially, were protected areas, as well as areas that were or should become indigenous territories. Madidi thus borders two protected areas in Peru, and three national protected areas, three indigenous territories, and two proposed indigenous territories in Bolivia. Since its creation, a municipal park has been added to its borders. Today the \" Global Community \" is increasingly aware of the importance of both conserving natural resources and helping indigenous communities survive in this new era. The two causes have largely converged over the past couple of decades as conservationists and indigenous groups have increasingly recognized their mutual interests (Beltrán, 2000; Stevens, 1997; Davis & Wali, 1994; Kleymeyer, 1994; Poole, 1993; Durning, 1992; COICA, 1989; Poole, 1989; Brownrigg, 1985; Clad, 1985). Now almost every hectare of Amazonian forest and every indigenous group is considered a valuable resource to the conservation world, and money is made available to conserve these lands and help the people who inhabit them. It would appear that everyone supports conservation efforts these days: the Bolivian government, foreign governments, multilateral agencies, businesses, international non-governmental organizations and foundations . . . the list goes on and on. In a very short span of time, significant funding has been made available for conservation. And yet, from our local perspective, it is becoming increasingly difficult to implement good community-based conservation strategies. Why is this happening? Whereas conservation was integrated into many traditional cultures as a way of life, western Keynotemodels of \" progress \" have challenged these models. Local efforts to regain control of our regions are now being upstaged by big projects being implemented by outside \" experts. \" My purpose here is to give a frank account of our experience in the hope of identifying the problems and aiming towards solu- tions.","doi":"10.1300/J091v17n01_02","journal":{"name":"Journal of Sustainable Forestry","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1076}

We analysed local mitiga-tion techniques and propose possible measures to reduce human–elephant conflicts. For four protected areas in Bangladesh, we investigated how people interact with elephants and other crop-damaging species. Crop-damaging species differed from site to site, but elephants were generally the most frequent offenders. Although some people were able to control crop damage caused by other wildlife, damage caused by wild elephants was mostly uncontrollable. Forest villagers were somewhat tolerant of damage caused by other wildlife but they were not tolerant of damage caused by wild elephants. Tolerance of crop damage caused by wildlife other than wild elephants tended to increase with distance of respondents from protected areas. Non-tolerance of crop damage caused by wildlife was more common in southeast Bangladesh than in the north. Habitat destruction, caused by high population growth and poverty, appeared to be a major cause for increasing human–elephant conflict. There is an urgent need for adoption of an umbrella strategy (e.g. estimate the size of elephant populations, develop landscape-scale conservation plans and create forest buffer zones under community-based natural resource management schemes) in the use of conflict mitigation as a conservation tool for Asian elephants.","doi":"10.1080/21513732.2011.554867","journal":{"name":"International Journal of Biodiversity Science, Ecosystem Services & Management","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":654}

The Garoua regional wildlife college for francophone Africa (Cameroon) developed the first long (diploma and certificate) and refresher courses in community conservation for mid-career PA managers and guards from West and Central Africa. Through lectures, case studies and participatory rural appraisal exercises, the courses emphasized the development of skills for tuning principles of people participation to the conservation objectives of PAs. The present study reviews the trainees' evaluations of these courses, to appreciate their relevance and support their further development. Diploma students judged the course as highly relevant because of the acquired analytical skills, whereas certificate students considered them only of medium relevance. The response to short refresher courses varied as a function of the use of cases from either the trainees' professional experience or from the fieldwork location. The reactions of trainees to this learning opportunity show that PA personnel are not 'attitude-limited' as often suggested. Their constraints to develop a more people-oriented work style lie largely in the areas of knowledge and skills. These findings point to the need for increased efforts to implement training of PA personnel in community conservation, preferably early in their careers.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892905002523","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":660}

The question of who gets access to rejuvenated lands is often highly political, however. Environmental managers \" reclaim \" land resources by rehabilitating them, but they simultaneously reanimate struggles over property rights in the process, allowing specific groups of resource users to literally and figuratively \" reclaim \" the land. Relying on data gathered during fourteen months of field work between 1989 and 1995, this paper analyzes the openings created by environmental policy reforms introduced over the past two decades along The Gambia River Basin, and the tactics and strategies rural Gambians have developed to manipulate these policies for personal gain. Specifically, I demonstrate how women market gardeners pressed \" secondary \" usufruct rights to great advantage to ease the economic impact of persistent drought conditions for the better part of a decade, only to have male lineage heads and community leaders \" reclaim \" the resources in question through donor-generated agroforestry and soil and water management projects. This is thus a study of the responses different community groups have made to a shifting international development agenda centered on environmental goals. It is simultaneously an analysis of those environmental policies and practices and their impact on gendered patterns of resource access and control within a set of critical rural livelihood systems.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1100}

Introduction The marine aquarium trade supplies aquarium keepers with ornamental species such as fish, corals, sea anemones, crustaceans, echinoderms and polychaetes. Although the real volume is unknown, it has been estimated that 14–30 million fish from over 1800 species, 1.5 million live stony corals, and 9–10 million other vertebrates are traded annually [1,2]. Over 90% of all ornamental species are caught in the coral reefs of at least 45 countries including Brazil, the Maldives, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and the United States (Hawaii). More than two thirds of all organisms come from Indonesia and the Philippines [3]. Main importer is the United States with over 60%, followed by the European Union and Japan [2,4]. The catching of ornamental fish started in Sri Lanka in the 1930s [5]. Through the 1950s, it extended in the Philippines and Hawaii. By the 1980 s, the collection of ornamental species had already spread throughout large parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific islands, and the Caribbean [1] . Over the last two decades, technological developments in the aquarium industry promoted a shift in preferences from simple fish-only tanks towards the creation of marine reef mini-ecosystems [6]. This caused a sharp increase in the demand for marine ornamentals, especially invertebrates [1,7]. By the early 2000, the marine aquarium trade was already a multimillion dollar industry with an estimated global value of 200–330 million USD per year [8]. From ocean to aquarium, marine ornamentals pass through a complex supply chain represented by collectors, middlemen, exporters, importers, retailers, and final buyers. Values of organisms increase throughout the supply chain, but only a very small amount of the profit goes to the collector [8,9]. Nonetheless, it has been argued that catching of marine ornamentals could potentially create significant benefits to low-income coastal communities, especially in regions where other income alternatives are largely absent [8,10]. But until now, there is little empirical evidence for a contribution of ornamental fishing to the livelihoods of local resource collectors. A recent study from Indonesia has shown that fishing for marine ornamentals was part of a wider marine resource use portfolio, and that income from ornamental fishing varies substantially between individual fishermen [11]. Indonesia's neighbour Papua New Guinea (PNG) did only recently join the marine aquarium trade. Papua New Guinea has more than 40,000 km 2 of coral reefs to a depth of 30 m [12]. These reefs belong to the most species diverse ecosystems in the world [13]. Exploitation of marine resources is for the most part limited to small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries. While coral reefs and their associated marine resources in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have been heavily impacted by overexploitation and destructive fishing activities, Papua New Guinea's reefs still remain comparatively pristine. This makes them an interesting location also for catching marine ornamental species. Until 2007, the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) of Papua New Guinea was opposed to the involvement of the country in the marine aquarium trade. Negative impacts associated with the collection of marine ornamentals had raised concerns about the sustainability of this activity. High mortality of organisms caused by poor catching and holding equipment [9], detrimental effects upon targeted populations caused by selective catching and over- exploitation [14,15], and the loss of corals after the application of cyanide [16] are major issues in this respect. However, a number of large marine aquarium retailers had contacted the NFA and expressed their interest in establishing the marine ornamental trade also in PNG. In 2007, the National Fisheries Authority contracted a US-based consultancy to conduct a first assessment of marine resources of potential interested for the aquarium trade. This consultancy was later developed into a three year project under the name \" Sea Sustainable Marine Aquarium Resources Trade \" (SeaSmart Programme ). A total budget of 5 million USD was spent by the NFA in order to develop a sustainable approach to marine ornamental fishing that was supposed to generate benefits to local fishing communities while avoiding the negative ecological consequences listed above. In this article, the results of the SeaSmart Programme are evaluated. The overall outcomes of the project in establishing the marine aquarium trade in Papua New Guinea are assessed, target species are listed, and their collection and handling is described. The main focus of this analysis, however, is on the local collectors, and on the impacts of this new activity on them and their communities. Specifically, (1) the general characteristics of marine ornamental fishers and their communities are described; (2) the benefits from collecting marine ornamentals are assessed and their contribution to household income is quantified; and (3) the perceptions on the impacts of the SeaSmart Programme on household and community level are gathered.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2013.09.018","journal":null,"aid":1101}

In India over 50 million people are believed to be directly dependent upon NTFPs for their subsistence. However, such human dependence on NTFPs for livelihood gains (win) has most frequently been at a certain ecological cost (lose). If livelihoods are to be maintained, the existing 'win-lose' settings have to be steered to a 'win-win' mode, otherwise, there could be severe erosion of the biological resources and loss of livelihoods ('lose-lose'). Examining the dependence of forest fringe communities on NTFPs at three sites in south India with contrasting human and ecological settings, three key factors (extent of dependence on NTFPs, indigenous ecological knowledge and market organization) are likely to constrain reaching the win-win situation. How these factors shape the ecological cost of harvesting NTFPs at the three sites is examined. Within the parameter space of these factors, it is possible to predict outcomes and associations that will conform to win-win or win-lose situations. Empirical data derived from the three study sites demonstrate the causality of the observed associations. The key for long-term livelihood gains lies in reducing the ecological cost. Certain interventions and recommendations that could optimize the balance between livelihood gains and ecological cost are proposed.","doi":"10.1017/S0376892904001596","journal":{"name":"Environmental Conservation","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":721}

This paper proposes the use of transformative learning as one of the measures of the success of a community conservation project in terms of promoting learning that leads to significant changes in a participant's values and attitudes. Using the ASSETS programme in coastal Kenya as a case study, we focused on participant learning and the extent to which such learning resulted in a more positive attitude towards conservation of the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. Participation in ASSETS resulted in instrumental learning and communicative learning, as described in the transformative learning theory. Findings show that participation in ASSETS led to a variety of learning outcomes, such as learning new information about the forest, and learning to question local cultural norms and speak out for conservation.","doi":"10.4103/0972-4923.79187","journal":null,"aid":1113}

To improve the adequacy of conservation strategies where chimpanzees live alongside people, it is essential to understand not only chimpanzee behavior and ecology [Hockings, 2007; McLennan & Hill, 2010; Naughton‐ Treves, 1998; Tweheyo et al., 2005] but also how people perceive chimpanzees and behave towards them [Costa, 2010; Hill, 2004; Hill & Webber, 2010; Kohler, 2005; McLennan & Hill, 2012; Nyanganji et al., 2010]. Recent ethnoprimatological research has emphasized the necessary dialogue between the disciplines of ecology and social anthropology in primate conservation [Fuentes & Hockings, 2010; Lee, 2010; Sousa & Frazão‐Moreira, 2010] . Understanding peoples' knowledge and perceptions about chimpanzees should be the first step towards conservation. In addition, environmental education has been mentioned frequently as an important component of conservation strategies [e.g., Casanova & Sousa, 2007; IUCN/UNEP/WWF, 1991], given that the success of conservation programs depends on local people's ability to implement them [Bonine et al., 2003 [Bonine et al., : 1209. Where chimpanzees live in proximity to agricultural communities, they can raid a large variety of crops [Hockings & McLennan, 2012]—a behavior that promotes close interactions with humans [Hill, 1997 [Hill, , 2000. Human–chimpanzee interactions are described as positive in certain circumstances [Hockings & Sousa, 2012], but negative interactions have been reported more widely [Costa, 2010; Halloran et al., 2013; Hockings et al., 2009; McLennan, 2008; Richards, 2000]. Deforestation is said to promote negative interactions between humans and chimpanzees and therefore shape negative perceptions of chimpanzees [McLennan, 2008]. Local perceptions of chimpanzees as \" the property of researchers \" can also generate negative attitudes towards the species [Naughton‐Treves, 1997]. On the other hand, in some African countries, chimpanzees are generally not seen as food for people, because of their status as a human‐like species [McLennan, 2008; McLennan & Hill, 2012] and as \" human‐like \" and \" respectful \" , but \" dangerous \" , as described at Budongo forest (Uganda) [Hill & Webber, 2010]. In Cantanhez National Park in Guinea‐Bissau, Casanova et al. [in press], Costa [2010] and Costa et al. [2013] reported that the species is considered \" ugly \" and \" inedible \" . It is suggested that aesthetics and edibility might be associated in perceptions of wildlife species [Casanova et al., in press].","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":1122}

E. and Wegge P. and Y.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION A key component in many countries' conservation strategies has long been the establishment of national parks and other forms of protected areas, so that more than 8,500 protected areas, which together cover about 800 million hectares, are now found practically throughout the world (WRI, 1994). A large number of these protected areas have been established in developing countries, but the needs and aspirations of rural people living next to them have been largely overlooked when implementing conservation strategies. Successful conservation has in fact often been linked to the need to protect natural areas from traditional use by local people (Zube & Busch, 1990 ). Rural villagers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the establishment of protected areas, as they depend primarily on locally available resources for their physical livelihood and spiritual needs (Shiva et al, 1982; Gadgil, 1990; Mishra e? a/., 1992). Crop-raiding and -predation by park wildlife may further increase the problems of securing a sustainable livelihood for people living next to these areas. Wild animals' entry to agricultural lands may lead to various forms of damage, e.g. from crop-loss by raiding and destruction, prevention of farmers from using arable land due to fear of crop damage, livestock depredation by park animals, and harassment and injuries to local people. In addition, guarding and the construction and maintenance of various protective measures bear heavy indirect costs owing to the time and financial investments involved. In the rapidly-emerging literature on park-people relations, frequent references are made to crop damage as a major source of conflict between resident people and protected areas (Kiss, 1990; West & Brechin, 1991). On the Indian subcontinent Schultz (1986), and Johnsingh & Panwar (1992), document the seriousness of crop damage and human injuries by wild Elephants (Elephas maximus). However, as stated by Schultz (1986) , accurate information on crop damage by other wild animals is scarce . About 11% of Nepal's land area is designated as national parks or otherwise protected areas (IUCN, 1993). In the Terai (lowland) region of this otherwise mountainous country, five large areas have been designated national parks or protected areas, and from a conservation point of view the outcome has proved successful (Mishra et al., 1992). Villagers living adjacent to these parks, etc., are allowed to collect grass within their boundaries for thatching. This is allowed during a yearly two-weeks' period towards compensation for the denial to use traditional resources of the national parks and otherwise protected areas and for damage caused by wildlife (Heinen & Kattel, 1992). Park authorities have also assisted local development efforts by providing timber for construction of local schools and bridges, diverting park rivers for irrigation purposes, and also various other activities. However, recent studies suggest that conflicts between conservation interests and local development are increasing in areas adjacent to Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) (Milton & Binney, 1980; Lehmkuhl etal., 1988; Jnawali, 1989; Sharma, 1990; Mishra et al., 1992; Heinen, 1993; Nepal & Weber, 1993; Sharma & Shaw, 1993). Heinen (1993) discussed park-people relations in Kosi Tappu Wildlife Reserve in eastern Terai. In the more sparsely populated and less researched western Terai, the results of recent observation indicates increasing conflicts adjacent to the Royal Bardia National Park (RBNP) as well (Khatri, 1993; Leisure & Mehta, 1993; Sasthre, 1993), but conclusive data are scarce. The objectives of this paper are to (i) quantify the extent of crop damage and livestock predation by park animals in villages adjacent to RBNP, and (ii) discuss strategies employed by affected farmers to minimize the problem.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":689}

The findings are used to gauge management performance and effectiveness of the HMMRs. Two surveys with different survey designs, targeting fishermen with different fishing techniques, produced conflicting results.

The influence of a number of factors, including socioeconomic characteristics, perception of coral resources state of health and attitudes towards non-compliance with regulations are analysed. During May 2006, 640 questionnaires were distributed to school children around Reunion Island, Western Indian Ocean, for completion by their parents, following an informal educational activity made in school. From a 73% (n ¼ 469) response rate, results showed that 78% of participants were in favour of the MPA. Analysis further identified that those supportive of the MPA were generally from higher socio-professional categories, had a negative perception of the coral reef ecosystem's health and were not originally from Reunion. In contrast, locals (born in Reunion) from lower socio-professional categories or with no employment activity and having a positive perception of the health status of coral reefs offered no opinion on the MPA. Attitudes towards enforcement and compliance highlighted that SCUBA divers, fishers and jet skiers attributed a higher value to the protection of the coral reef environment through enforcement of MPA regulations than to their own use of the coral reef resource. When asked about the use of penalties to deter non-compliance, swimmers were awarded the lowest fines, followed by SCUBA divers, fishers then jet skiers being awarded the highest fines. Thus, the more severe the act of non-compliance by a resource user group was perceived to be, the more these users themselves disapproved of non-compliant behaviour and supported use of high penalties. The survey design through focusing on school children's parents, demonstrated a simple and cost-effective method for data collection while providing environmental education, which could be employed in similar case studies elsewhere.","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2010.01.008","journal":null,"aid":1151}

Management capacity in protected areas depends upon the system of go-vernance, the level of resources and local community support. The key question of interest at the global level are whether the responsible authorities have the capacity to manage their protected areas effectively, and whether desired outcomes are achieved on the ground. Measuring these dimensions is contextual; what is effective in one country or locale may be inappropriate in another. Thus, assessing management capacity is context specific. The potential declaration of Tara National Park located in Serbia as a Biosphere Reserve necessitated research to characterize the institutional context , the social and demographic situation of the communities within the Park boundaries. There is a growing recognition that the sustainable management of protected areas ultimately depends on the cooperation and support of the local people. In order to achieve sustainable conservation, state legislators and environmental planners should involve local people in the management of protected areas and need to identify and promote social processes that enable local communities to conserve and enhance biodiversity as a part of their livelihood system. Drawing upon research in Tara National Park, this paper analyzes the potential capacity of people living within Tara National Park to effectively participate in the management of the protected area by incorporating activities that promote biodiversity within their everyday livelihood strategies. The results demonstrate that sustaining or providing alternative livelihood strategies is necessary in order to halt the exploitation of protected areas by local people striving to survive.

The overexploitation of inshore fishing resources is a major problem in Viet Nam's coastal areas along the Mekong Delta. As a result, the Catch per Unit of Effort of small-scale fishing enterprises has decreased, undermining the sustainability of livelihoods of fishing families. The paper focuses on livelihoods' strategies and diversification in the context of overexploitation and exhaustion of near-shore resources in relation to fishery policies. The results show that overexploitation is unavoidable in near-shore waters because of the lack of enforcement of fishery regulations for offshore vessels and the limitation of alternative sources of income and opportunities for livelihood diversification for small-scale fishers. The present policies to prevent overexploitation need to be reconciled with livelihood sustainability and fishery management, resource conservation and socioeconomic goals Crown","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2012.06.021","journal":null,"aid":238}

The devolution of forest management and benefit sharing in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam","authors":"Thi T. and Ha T. and Van Dijk H. and Bush S. R.","dAbstract":"Large parts of the world's remaining mangrove forest are lost due to the expansion of shrimp farming in coastal areas. Current forest allocation and subcontracting policies of the Vietnamese government with respect to the devolution of forest management and participation of local people in sustainable forest management reflect both environmental and economic concerns. The paper aims at investigating how the devolution of rights over forestland and benefit sharing mechanisms are related to actual rights and the distribution of benefits of forest management practices. The findings show that farmer's decision-making over mangroves is very much influenced by shrimp farming since the income from mangroves is very low compared to that from shrimp. Farmer's decision making over forest is very much influenced by the way in which the benefit sharing policy is implemented by the state-owned forestry companies and management boards. However, their attitudes towards mangrove plantation and protection are far from negative. The study supports the claim that shrimp farmers may well be able to plant, protect and manage mangroves if they have more rights and responsibilities over forests and are able to benefit more from the production of mangroves. In this way more sustainable management of mangrove forests may be promoted.","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.07.034","journal":null,"aid":241}

R. and Van Weerd M. and Van Der Ploeg J. and Van Der Ploeg J. and Araño R.

Policy makers assume that people are antagonistic toward conserving crocodiles in the wild and think that the enforcement of environmental legislation in a context of widespread rural poverty is illegitimate and ineffective. They argue that these negative public attitudes can only be transformed by generating revenues for rural communities, for example, through crocodile ranching or ecotourism. Despite the evident failure to conserve crocodiles in the wild, this thinking continues to underpin policy and practice in the Philippines. A community-based conservation project in the northern Sierra Madre on Luzon puts this utilitarian logic in perspective. The project succeeded in transforming hostile attitudes toward crocodiles and mobilized broad societal support for the protection of the Philippine crocodile and its freshwater habitat. Cultural values, such as pride in the occurrence of this rare and iconic species, form an important incentive for people to support the preservation of the species in the wild. These experiences highlight the importance of moving beyond ideological positions in discussions on biodiversity conservation, and enable the design of integrative and innovative solutions to conserve wildlife in human-dominated landscapes.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"The Journal of Environment Development Downloaded from Journal of Environment & Development","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1178}
{"filename":"Van Vliet 2010","year":2010,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION People living in landscapes of high conservation importance are trapped between their dependence on natural resources to meet their local development aspirations and the international pressure to conserve these resources with high international value. This dynamic is particularly apparent with the establishment and management of national parks and other types of protected areas, as they represent the cornerstone of most biodiversity conservation strategies (Stevens 1997, Brechin et al. 2003). In the past, some conservation initiatives have ignored the need to take into account local development aspirations to meet conservation goals and have sometimes clearly undermined human rights and livelihoods through restriction of access, displacement, or oppressive enforcement measures (Brockington 1999, Cernea 2000, Schmidt-Soltau 2005, Brockington and Igoe 2006, Cernea and SchmidtSoltau 2006, West and Brechin 1991 However, it is increasingly recognized that conservation of some natural resources cannot be accomplished without providing alternative solutions for local communities depending on these resources for income and subsistence. In 2003, the World Parks Congress resolved that the social costs of protected-area establishment should be fully compensated (International Union for the Conservation ofNature 2003). The Seventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity called for an assessment of the economic and socio-cultural costs for local communities arising from the establishment and maintenance of protected areas, and an adjustment of policies to ensure that such costs and impacts are equitably compensated (Convention on Biodiversity 2004). To conform to these international resolutions, landscape managers and conservationists are increasingly challenged with integrating social rights and development aspirations into meeting conservation goals. Organizations with the primary mission of conservation have more recently adopted forms of integrated conservation and development approaches (Campbell and Vainio-Mattila 2003), or a more explicit rights-based approach (Campese et al. 2007). Rather than a concentration on protected areas alone, a more integrated landscape approach that aims to achieve both biodiversity conservation and development outcomes is becoming more widely adopted (Wells et al. 2004). This shift toward more participatory processes to achieve conservation goals and with a landscape-level focus could be a significant step toward more equitable and successful conservation. However, global experiences illustrate that successful \" integration \" of conservation and development continues to be elusive, and synergies between conservation and development do not emerge naturally (Barrett et al. 2005). Either compensation measures have no clear link to the impact of conservation on local livelihoods and, therefore, lead to a loss of resilience of local communities (Robinson and Redford 2004, Sayer and Campbell 2004, Wells et al. 2004), or they are not directly conditioned by the provision of environmental services and, therefore, lead to disastrous effects on biodiversity conservation. Other sources of failure are: the disconnection in time frames between conservation and development activities, and the lack of assessment of external risks such as markets, climate change, or the political context, that can destroy conservation and development efforts by significantly influencing local strategies to move in unpredictable directions beyond the coping range of social–ecological systems. The concepts of resilience and vulnerability provide a useful framework for analyzing how to improve compensation measures in the context of conservation and development. The resilience knowledge domain is grounded in ecology and mathematics with a focus on theoretical models, whereas the vulnerability and adaptation knowledge domains are grounded in geography and natural hazards research. The key parameters of vulnerability and resilience are: exposure, that is, the stress to which a system is exposed; sensitivity, that is, the degree to which the system can be influenced by sources of exposure; and adaptive capacity, that is, the capacity to recover a stable state after exposure to external stimuli. A focus on \" practical adaptation \" is increasingly common in the field of climate change research but, to our knowledge, the term is not yet used in the field of conservation and development projects. By \" practical adaptation, \" we mean research that investigates the adaptive capacity of a particular community to identify means of implementing adaptation initiatives (Smit and Wandel 2006). In the context of climate change, exposure is linked to natural disasters caused by climate variability, whereas in the context of conservation and development projects, community exposure is caused by changes in access to natural resources and livelihood options. The vulnerability and resilience of local livelihoods depends on people's \" baseline \" conditions in terms of nutrition, health, morale, and other aspects of well-being; their own efforts and strategies to reinforce their livelihoods; their access to proper support by government or civil-society institutions; and their social and political networks, including social and political capital. Participatory vulnerability assessments aim to document the ways in which the community experiences changing conditions. The focus is on conditions that are important to the community rather than those assumed to be important by researchers or other experts. We adapted the approach proposed by Smit Ecology and Society 15(2): 6 http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol15/iss2/art6/Fig. 1.

We monitored bushmeat traded in the market of Kisangani (the provincial capital of the Province Orientale in the Democratic Republic of Congo) and compared data collected in surveys in 2002 and 2008–2009. In both periods more than two-thirds of the carcasses sold were of rodents and ungulates. From 2002 to 2008–2009 the number of carcasses increased by 44% but the equivalent biomass by only 16% because of a significant decrease in medium-sized species (10–50 kg) and an increase in small species (, 10 kg). The number of carcasses of large species increased between the two periods and those of diurnal monkeys increased fourfold. In both periods smoked bushmeat was one of the cheapest sources of protein available year-round, together with caterpillars, which were only available during the rainy season, and pork. Prices of other domestic meat were significantly higher. This study identified an increase in the market of highly threatened species such as okapi Okapia johnstoni and small diurnal monkeys and the continued presence of protected species, and also highlights the food security role that bushmeat plays for poor urban people who cannot afford alternative sources of protein.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605311000202","journal":null,"aid":1180}

E.","dAbstract":"Across West and Central Africa, wildlife provides a source of food and income. We investigated the relation between bushmeat hunting and household wealth and protein consumption in 2 rural communities in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. One village was dedicated to commercial hunting, the other trapped game primarily for food. We tested whether commercial-hunter households were nutritionally advantaged over subsistence-hunter households due to their higher income from the bushmeat trade and greater access to wild-animal protein. We conducted bushmeat-offtake surveys in both villages (captures by hunters and carcasses arriving to each village). Mammals (including threatened primates: black colobus [Colobus satanas], Preussi's guenon [Allochrocebus preussi], and russet-eared guenon [Cercopithecus erythrotis]), birds, and reptiles were hunted. The blue duiker (Philantomba monticola), giant pouched rat (Cricetomys emini), and brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus africanus) contributed almost all the animal biomass hunted, consumed, or sold in both villages. Monkeys and Ogilbyi's duikers (Cephalophus ogilbyi) were hunted only by commercial hunters. Commercial hunters generated a mean of US$2000/year from bushmeat sales. Households with commercial hunters were on average wealthier, generated more income, spent more money on nonessential goods, and bought more products they did not grow. By contrast, households with subsistence hunters spent less on market items, spent more on essential products, and grew more of their own food. Despite these differences, average consumption of vegetable protein and domestic meat and bushmeat protein did not differ between villages. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the socioeconomic and nutritional context of commercial and subsistence bushmeat hunting to correctly interpret ways of reducing their effects on threatened species and to enable the sustainable offtake of more productive taxa. Resumen: En´En´ Africa Central y Occidental la fauna silvestre es una fuente de ingresos y alimento. Investig-amos la relación entre la carne de caza, la economía familiar y la ingesta de proteínas en dos comunidades rurales en la Isla de Bioko, Guinea Ecuatorial. Una aldea se dedicaba a la caza comercial mientras que la otra cazaba principalmente para autoconsumo. Comprobamos si las familias que practicaban la caza comercial tenían ventajas nutricionales sobre las familias que practicaba una caza de subsistencia debido a sus mayores ingresos por el comercio de la carne y mayor acceso a proteínas procedentes de la fauna silvestre. Realizamos encuestas para conocer la extracción de carne de caza en ambas aldeas (capturas por cazadores y piezas que llegaban a cada aldea). Se cazaron mamíferos (incluyendo primates amenazados: colobo negro Colobus 577 satanas, cercopitecos de Preuss Allochrocebus preussi y cercopitecos de orejas rojas Cercopithecus erythrotis), aves y reptiles. El cefalofo o duiquero azul Phillantomba maonticola, la rata gigante de Emin Cricetomys emini y el puercoespín africano Atherurus africanus resultaron ser la mayoría de la biomasa animal cazada, consumida o comercializada en ambas aldeas. El duiquero de Ogilby Cephalophus ogilbyi y otros monos fueron cazados solamente por los cazadores comerciales. ´ Estos generaron un promedio de US$2000 al año con las ventas de la carne. Sus familias tuvieron una economía más saneada, mayores ingresos, gastaron más dinero en bienes no esenciales, comprando más productos en vez de cultivarlos. Por el contrario, las familias de los cazadores de subsistencia gastaron menos dinero en bienes de mercado y más en productos esenciales y cultivaron sus propios alimentos. A pesar de estas diferencias, el consumo medio de proteínas vegetales y animales (domésticos y carne de caza) no fue diferente entre ambas aldeas. Nuestros resultados resaltan la importancia de entender el contexto socioeconómico y nutricional en el que se desarrolla la caza comercial y de subsistencia para poder interpretar correctamente las vías para reducir sus efectos sobre las especies amenazadas y permitir una extracción sostenible de los taxones más productivos.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Conservation Biology","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1182}

G. and Coulibaly O. and Adégbidi A. and Sinsin B.","dAbstract":"Commitment of local communities to protected areas is essential for conserving biodiversity. However, in many developing countries like Benin, former management strategies kept human from protected areas using coercion. Fortunately, more recent regimes attempt to give local populations more control on the management but little is known about local residents' perceptions, beliefs and attitudes toward the management of these areas. This study, carried out around the Pendjari National Park, determined factors which support local communities' positive perceptions towards biodiversity conservation in the park, analysed their assessment of current park management activities compared to former management approaches and draw the implications for effective participatory management of protected areas. We collected socio-demographic data from 164 residents on their awareness of conservation methods. We used Stepwise Discriminant Analysis to differentiate the variables that had the greatest power for discriminating between local residents' perception to conserve or not biodiversity and to manage the park. The findings indicated that the positive behavior of local communities towards conservation of biodiversity within Pendjari National Park was highly correlated with the current management strategy that involved more effectively local communities, the educational level of participants and their geographical origins. Participants' perceptions of biodiversity conservation were strongly related to locally perceived benefits. Although 89% of participants were favorable to the concept of biodiversity conservation within the park, the decision to ban encroachments due to agricultural activities increased negative opinion on this park management option. Our results suggested that understanding local residents' perceptions and using them as a starting point to improve the park–people relationship could help park management staff to involve more effectively local communities and improve their awareness about biodiversity conservation within the park.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2010.06.008","journal":null,"aid":728}

An increasing number of coastal households in tropical countries see their livelihoods endangered by declining fisheries catches. Acceptable livelihood alternatives are needed to reduce the pressure on the marine environment. Indonesian coastal communities do not always depend exclusively on fishing but often diversify their livelihood portfolios, which makes livelihood programs a relevant policy intervention for them. Sea cucumber mariculture is increasingly advocated in Indonesian coastal management. Using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and non-participant observation, current livelihoods and the attitudes toward the possibility of sea cucumber mariculture activities were assessed in two coastal villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Respondents stated a high interest in alternative livelihoods. At the same time, non-economic factors such as tradition and personal gratification played an important role in decisions on whether to fish or not. Villagers' attitudes were influenced by fishery-related experiences, perceptions and understandings, as well as by previous experiences with alternative livelihood programs. The results suggest that it is easier to turn people with farming experience into aquaculturists than people who are highly focused on fishing. Moreover, the indications are that sea cucumber mariculture would remain an additional source of income rather than replace fishing. In the study area, mariculture is still an unfamiliar activity, not yet sufficiently trusted to generate willingness to invest. Villagers' general acceptance of non-fishing income alternatives will need to be promoted if livelihood alternatives are to be successful in reducing pressure on marine resources.","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.12.012","journal":null,"aid":729}

Since the 1960s, when motors were first introduced to Ghana's artisanal canoe fleet, two interrelated processes have occurred in Cape Coast. First, Ghana's fisheries have become increasingly exploited and—in the case of some species—overfished. Second, the social relations of production in the artisanal sector have shifted from being socially embedded to being more market-based and impersonal. I argue that two recent Women in Development (WID) projects in particular have contributed to the breakdown of fishtraders' traditional economic networks and livelihood strategies: (a) loan schemes that target women's associations , and (b) the 1985 Intestate Succession Law, which reconfigured inheritance rights. These WID projects, based on western notions of gender and the household, have created disharmony and mistrust among Cape Coast's fishtraders rather than promoting their \" development. \" The breakdown of fishtraders' labor and marketing organizations has resulted in increasingly desperate strategies to get fish, increased degradation of Ghana's marine environment , and uncertainty for the future of the coastal economy.","doi":"","journal":{"name":"Professional Geographer","volume":"","issue":""},"aid":1190}

Many cases in different parts of the world indicate that the Indigenous peoples have developed patterns of resource use and management practices that reflect detailed knowledge of local geography and ecosystem, and contribute to the natural conservation through their living practices. The guidelines of Indigenous knowledge and culture lay the base for the development of ecotourism. A critical evaluation of the conceptuali-zation of Indigenous knowledge is therefore, essential to the success of an alternative strategy to development for aboriginal communities. Participatory observation in the field of ecotourism activities and brief interviews are the major study methods, with several workshops conducted to supplement data collection for the two case studies. The Taroko area came into contact with tourists in a relative early era due to its famous natural features and national park. Its growing ecotourism is the result of cooperation among local residents, environmentalists, and academics, each with very different concepts of ecotourism operation. The national park and public sectors have also played significant role in shaping the content of ecotourism. In San-Chan community, due to the negative impacts generated by the unregulated mass tourism expansion, the local Indigenous people decide to close the public access to the attractive creek for 3 years, while at the same time promote ecotourism for poverty alleviation. These two cases embrace the 'Nature' as an important element in their construction of new place identity and community development. However, their spatial location in-or outside the national park produces significant differences and sociopolitical implications on the operations of ecotourism.","doi":"10.1007/s10708-010-9373-7","journal":null,"aid":750}

Free-ranging European bison have existed in this area for 40 years, inhabiting a suboptimal habitat characterized by intensive agriculture and fragmented forests. Despite 85.0 % of respondents reporting positive attitudes towards bison presence, 47.4 % of respondents considered the animals acceptable only if they were not closer than 10 km from their residence. Over 60 % of respondents suggested increasing the numbers of bison in the country, and 51 % suggested letting them live freely in the wild. The most negative attitude towards an increase in numbers was shown by women, respondents with lower knowledge of the species and inhabitants of biggest settlements. Public awareness relating to the European bison is lacking, as nearly 50 % of persons residing near areas inhabited by bison did not know about their presence. We conclude that, despite the high valuation placed upon the bison by the public and the ability of the bison to survive in open agrolandscapes with fragmented forests, negative public opinion may be a factor limiting the social carrying capacity for the species. Lithuanian human dimensions of this species should be taken into account when introducing the European bison elsewhere in Western Europe.","doi":"","journal":null,"aid":4}

These systems reflect the ecological knowledge of the farmers of such risk prone environments. Agroforestry parklands are playing an important role, through trees and shrubs providing soil cover that reduces erosion and buffers the impacts of climate change. They also provide green fodder that complements crop residues for livestock feeds, and fruits and leaves for human consumption and for income generation. The interactions between various components of the system influence the ecosystem service functions of trees of parklands (provisioning, regulating and supporting services) in several ways. These ecosystem functions have been at the center of the local ecological knowledge guiding the management options of the farmers and have also attracted the attention of scientists. Findings revealed new challenges that call for production options ensuring increased and diversified productivity of the systems while preserving the environment. Research on such challenges must adopt an inclusive approach based on local knowledge supported by science-based analyses of the socio-ecological systems in the face of high population pressure and climate change.","doi":"10.1016/j.cosust.2013.10.004","journal":null,"aid":31}

Within the t-test for equality of means, member households (test sample) and non-member households (matching sample) of the community forest management institution are compared. Due to time and cost limitations, the sample was restricted to  households which form over % of the test sample and about % of the total (control) population in the survey villages. Nevertheless, the sample was randomly drawn from the complete list of households in the survey villages. The test statistics that are presented include sample means, standard deviations, standard errors and p-values. The threshold p-value for differences being significant is set at p 4 ·.

This is followed by a discussion of social capital, an important expression of community life, related to access questions of wildlife consumption and conservation (see also Ribot & Peluso  on this issue of social relations and access). The section concludes with a discussion on the potentials of bushmeat (particularly the giant cane rat) domestication for achieving both livelihoods and conservation objectives. Socio-economic characteristics of households from forest communities in the Kilum-Ijim Mountain Forest Reserve Human capital was assessed based on the literacy of the household head and the household's labour force. Although the literacy rate (assessed as a cumulative percentage of those who completed primary school or higher) was generally lower than the national average of % (World Resource Institute ), more household heads participating in forest management institutions (·%) were literate compared with the matching households (·%). This difference suggests that more literate community members are elected into the forest management institution. Interestingly, the size of households participating in forest management institutions is larger (average  persons) than in matching households (average  persons) (Table ). This is certainly linked to a higher mean number of spouses (· versus ·) per household head in the forest management institution. It seems logical to assume that because larger households have higher needs for forest resources, and can therefore exert more pressure on forest resources, strategically they tend to be more likely to be asked to join a forest management institution. The average household size of members in forest management institutions is generally far higher than in other parts of the region. For instance, Balgah & Buchenrieder (a, b) found an average household size of almost five for fish farming and disaster-affected households in the Northwest Region respectively. This larger than average (regional) household size could be attributed to the generally rich fertile soils around the Kilum-Ijim Mountain and the relative abundance of livelihood resources appropriated from the conserved forest (Penn & Gardner ; Ndenecho ). Nevertheless, a higher percentage of households in forest management institutions were primarily occupied in subsistence agriculture (·%) as compared with the matching households (·%). The consequence is that the former tend to have larger farms and more plots than the latter since more mouths have to be fed (","doi":"10.1017/S0022278X12000596","journal":null,"aid":58}

To provide baseline data for a longitudinal study on the effects of newly established national parks on human livelihoods in Gabon we conducted a cross-sectional study that compared livelihood indicators between communities that do, and do not, use natural resources within protected areas. We interviewed 2,035 households in 117 villages at four sites, recording income, consumption, education, health indicators and social capital, and village characteristics such as distance to markets, distance to park boundaries, and land cover within a 5-km radius. Our results indicated that closed rainforest coverage was greater around park than control villages and that this difference was associated with a greater reliance of park households on forest resources. However, we found no systematic differences in most livelihood measures between park and control households. Instead, the relationship between household livelihood measures and proximity to parks varied in idiosyncratic ways between sites, suggesting that determinants of human welfare are highly localized and cannot be generalized to larger spatial scales.","doi":"10.1017/S0030605310001791","journal":null,"aid":null}

The Grootberg lodge partnership in Namibia: towards poverty alleviation and empowerment for long-term sustainability?","authors":"Lapeyre R. and Lapeyre R.","dAbstract":"This paper analyses socioeconomic impacts of a tourism community –public–private partnership in a rural area in Namibia and its contribution to achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals. Building on an institutional analysis as well as an applied sustainable livelihoods approach, it is argued that the Grootberg lodge partnership contributes to nature conservation, poverty alleviation as well as capacity-building and empowerment at both the individual and collective levels (the triple bottom line). Indeed, empirical data gathered in 2006 and 2007 show that the Grootberg lodge has helped to improve the livelihoods of some rural households by distributing to them secure wage revenues, building their financial and physical assets and reducing their vulnerability; it has further provided employees with essential training sessions (human capital) and has involved community members in some of the tourism management decisions. These results, however, remain context related and dependent on some important unpredictable and intangible variables (trust and openness); as a result, further systematic livelihood studies in other contexts are called for in order to better inform policy-makers on the future promotion and development of tourism partnerships both in Namibia and worldwide.","doi":"10.1080/13683500.2011.555521","journal":null,"aid":417}
