Thirty-three ethnographic interviews held in October 2010 found that 81.8% (N ¼ 27) of the fishermen interviewed were able to identify the species by its area of occurrence, coloration, and body size. The subsequent analysis of interviews was based on those 27 fishermen selected. There were no reports of positive interactions, and 52% (N ¼ 14) of those interviewed described negative interactions related to whales ''tearing and/or dragging the gillnets''. Accidents between whales and fishing vessels were described by 44% (N¼ 12) of the fishermen. Accidental captures in gillnets were mentioned in 48% (N ¼ 13) of the interviews and fishermen believed that these events were caused by whales failing to see gillnets in the water (N¼ 4) and by the position of these nets in the routes frequented by the mammals (N ¼ 9). In the fishermen's eyes this type of interaction has minimal impact on fishery. Therefore, is suggested the monitoring of areas frequented by whales and fishery, the use of gillnets away from these animals' migration routes, the search for alternative and lower-impact fishing activities, and the training of local actors for sustainable whale watching tourism in the region.","aid":15}

It reflects increased global awareness and the desire to travel to more authentic and exotic destinations (McLaren 1998). Usually the ecotourists are from developed countries, and their destinations are in the developing world (Fennell 2003; Appiah-Opoku 2004). Africa has long attracted travelers from developed countries who are interested in seeing tropical landscapes, wildlife, and indigenous peoples. More recently, the African rainforest has become a popular destination for ecotourists who seek not only adventure, but also an opportunity to learn about rainforest ecology and culture and to contribute to conservation efforts (Linden 1991; Igoe and Croucher 2007; Spenceley 2008). The hope is that their vacation dollars will give local communities incentives to protect rainforests and promote cultural norms and values (Stronza 2000). Since the concept of ecotourism emerged some 25 years ago, many sites in Africa have experienced hikes in visitation. Increased revenues from safari expeditions have been used to protect wildlife from poachers and to support education or health care in host communities. For instance, prior to the outbreak of civil war in Rwanda, tourists' visits provided approximately $1.02 million in direct annual revenues, enabling the government to create anti-poaching patrols and employ local residents (Gossling 1999). In 1997, Kenya earned $502 million from ecotourism, and this enabled the government to reinvest in anti-poaching patrols (Weaver 1999). The tropical rainforests are among the most ecologically threatened ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa (Plumptre 2002). Communities in the rainforest ecosystems typically depend on natural resources and biodiversity for food security and livelihoods (Blaikie 2006). Protected areas are increasingly being used as a tool for biodiversity conservation and ecotourism in these rainforest ecosystems and have become part of the Millennium Development Goals. Consequently, their mission has broadened to include a direct contribution to national development and poverty reduction (). Livelihood rights of rural communities are often seen to be at odds with biodiversity conservation in protected areas (Crane et al. 2009; Mazur and Stakhanov 2008). For instance, national parks often restrict local people's access to the natural landscapes, flora, and fauna while attracting ecotourists to these resources. The conservation community is increasingly being challenged to implement measures that respect human rights and reduce poverty (Alcorn and Royo 2007). Reconciling complex and often conflicting relationships between protected areas, ecotourism, and rural livelihoods is a major challenge facing conservationists in the rainforest region of West Africa. Against this background , this article examines the history of the Kakum National Park in Ghana, its operation, and the impact on rural livelihoods in villages that are within the vicinity of the park.","aid":815}

B. and Rose G. and Mahudi H.","dAbstract":"This study examined the perceptions of fishers from two fishing communities with differing use histories and involvement in the long-standing (16 yr) multiple use Mafia Island marine protected area (MIMP), Tanzania. A randomly distributed questionnaire indicated that 94% of fishers believed that without the MIMP, there would be overfishing, dynamite use, destroyed habitats, and few fish. Fishers were more positive about core zones (no-take fishery closures) than general use zones (areas allowing selective fishing) as a consequence of increases in fishing pressure. Those that reported increased catches and sizes of fish since the creation of the MIMP were more likely to agree with present zone locations and more positive in general about fisheries and conservation planning. Most thought that fish size and gear restrictions were preferable to permanent closures. Perceptions differed among communities and gear users. Community and gear type explained 46% of the variance in responses about the perception that fisheries and conservation are compatible goals. Somewhat surprisingly, these effects were more important than catch increases or involvement in MIMP-related activities. The differences in perception between communities may be partly attributed to different fishing histories. Multiple-use zoning provides a means to identify and resolve conflicts and achieve what are likely universal objectives for fisheries sustainability and conservation.","aid":26}

Introduction While the formal study of tourism is a relatively new addition to the academic curriculum, tourism itself is a very old subject and one which has been described and discussed for many years. However, as it has become the subject of academic scrutiny in recent decades, it has also become apparent that while we have learned much about it, there is still a great deal more to be discovered, explained, and understood. Nowhere, perhaps, is this clearer than in the relationship between tourism and the environment. It is often assumed and stated that tourism is dependent on the environment, and argued that if the environment deteriorates in quality, then tourism is likely to decline. Such an argument has often been seen as a fundamental element in this authors model of the tourism life cycle (Butler 1980), although as more recent discussions of this model have illustrated (Butler 2006a,b) the relationship is not as simple as it may seem. In exploring this relationship we come across several of the many paradoxes that can be found in tourism, elements which make tourism a fascinating if difficult subject for study, and an equally difficult one to plan and manage in the real world. The relationship between tourism destination development and the environment is a complex one, not least because of two key issues, one is definition of terms, and the other is the change that inevitably accompanies development and indeed, is an integral part of such a process. Without appreciating that tourism is dynamic and operates in a dynamic world, it is impossible to understand and deal with this relationship. It has to be appreciated that change is constant and that inconsistency and chaos can and do exist with order and rationality at different levels.","aid":36}

To achieve this objective we use a multinomial choice model of engagement (or non-engagement) in forest management activities based on household data from 4 villages surrounding the National Kabore Tambi Park in Burkina Faso. The results show that the participation by household members in forest conservation activities is mainly determined by the three variables that are related to policy: membership in community based forest management associations, security of land use rights, and training. The current training programs focus only on forest conservation practices. To be more efficient it should focus on increasing people's knowledge about the benefits due to conservation and the threats resulting from the lack of forest management. Furthermore the results indicate that improving land use right security would increase farmer's willingness to participate in forest management activities such as community work and forest surveillance. Thus particular attention should be paid to the prevailing system of land rights and its incentives, or disincentives, for promoting sustainable management of the forest resource.","aid":52}

It is also important for climate change adaptation, as well as mitigation policies on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Men and women relate to and use the forest differently and so may experience the effects of climate change and REDD+ policies differently. Investigations through semi-structured interviews and document reviews in three countries of the region revealed that women have had limited participation in discussions on issues of climate change or REDD+. There is some evidence that gender consideration will become part of future national REDD+ strategies. Strategies to foster the effective participation of all stakehold-ers are essential to ensure that gender dimensions are addressed in issues of climate change, forest access, forest management and distribution of carbon benefits. Sexe, changement climatique et REDD+ dans les forêts du bassin du Congo en Afrique Centrale H.C. PEACH BROWN La région du bassin du Congo en Afrique Centrale contient la seconde forêt tropicale contigüe du monde, une importante source de revenus pour des millions de personnes. Elle est également importante pour l'adaptation au changement climatique, ainsi que pour les politiques d'atténuation comme la réduction des émissions de la déforestation et de la dégradation des forêts (REDD+). Hommes et femmes ont une relation à la forêt différente, tout comme l'usage qu'ils en font, et ils ont par conséquent une expérience différente du changement climatique et de la politique de la REDD+. Une enquête à travers des interviews à demi structurés et une étude de documents dans trois pays de la région révéla que les femmes ont une participation limitée dans les débats sur les questions du changement climatique ou de la REDD+.

This paper assesses these interactions using a three-pronged conceptual framework of livelihoods, equity and rights (resource access and management rights, as well as indigenous and aboriginal rights). The framework is applied to examine the experiences of indigenous peoples in Canada and the Philippines regarding access to fishery resources, and participation in fisheries management and policy. These experiences demonstrate the importance of legally recognized rights not only as a key tool in resource management, but also in the pursuit of secure and equitable livelihoods on the part of indigenous peoples. While it is apparent that in some ways, serious mismatches exist between government policy and local livelihood needs, there are also illustrations of positive change in improving the situation of indigenous peoples.","aid":70}

This paper explores the impacts of local forest law enforcement with a focus on the poorest forest users in community-managed forests. A case study including 14 community forest groups in western Nepal was conducted in 2008. Methods included review of archival data, a stakeholder survey (n = 211), and recall of forest crimes by a random household sample (n = 252). Local forest law enforcement was found to detect far more crimes than district-level enforcement. Crimes are primarily small-scale unauthor-ised appropriation of products for subsistence use by poorer households and rules are lightly enforced. It is argued that local law enforcement, while apparently not economically harmful to the poorer in the short term, may be used to perpetuate existing wealth and cast-based social inequities.","aid":82}

In parts of the world with a history of armed conflict, the chances of such an approach being successfully adopted might seem remote. One such area is the Maputo Elephant Reserve in southern Mozambique. The aim was to improve understanding of the local people's use of natural resources and perceptions of the Reserve's impact. Interviews and questionnaires distributed in four different villages were used to estimate the relative value of these resources in relation to the attitude of the local people towards the Reserve. The people gave a relative value rank for each specific use of each plant, animal and fish resource. On average 60% of the households exploited more than two different resource categories. The plant resources of the Reserve were used by 71% of the households and were valued more highly than animal and fish resources. Plants were used for many purposes; construction material, fuelwood and fruits had the highest relative values. Antelopes, hippopotamus and elephants were valued highest amongst a range of animal species which were hunted by 21% of households. Amongst uses of animals, consumption, use of the skins and commercial sale of the meat were especially important. When asked if they liked the Reserve, 88% of respondents answered positively. The attitude towards the Reserve was correlated with crop damage experiences; people with crop damage caused by elephants, hippos or bushpigs, were more negative. Attitude of respondents was inversely related to the number of species invading their agricultural fields. Resource use intensity, use purpose, resource value and attitude were different amongst sites and dependent on site-specific circumstances, different management strategies could be necessary for the four sites. A resource management plan should be drawn up, local people should be included in the management team and steps should be taken to improve the relationship between the Reserve's authorities and the local population generally.","aid":110}

It consisted of the release of three natural enemies, two weevil species and one moth, that feed exclusively on water hyacinth. In 1999, a survey of 365 men and women from 192 households in 24 villages in the target area, using participatory and quantitative methods, revealed that water hyacinth, although not eliminated, was perceived by the villagers as having been reduced from a serious pest to one of minor or moderate importance. According to their estimates of the impacts they perceived, at the peak of the infestation water hyacinth had reduced the yearly income of this population of about 200 000 by approximately US$84 million. Lost revenues for men were mostly in fishing, while women experienced lost revenues in trade, primarily food crops and fish. The reduction of water hyacinth cover through biological control was credited with an increase in income of US$30.5 million per year. The total cost of the control program is estimated at a present value of US$2.09 million. Assuming the benefits are to stay constant over the next 20 years, a most conservative assumption, the accumulated present value would be US$260 million, yielding a respectable benefit cost ratio of 124:1. This ratio is calculated for direct economic effects on the people of Southern Benin only, and does not take into account indirect benefits or the benefits of the project to other countries were the biological control agents were successfully introduced. Other effects mentioned, but not measured, included an increase of water quality and of human health. #","aid":111}

This paper provides an overview and comparison of existing statutory legislation with respect to the extraction and trade of NTFPs in four Andean countries and discusses its adequacy with respect to ensuring legal and sustainable extraction and trade of NTFPs. The related legal framework surrounding indigenous peoples' rights, traditional knowledge and access to genetic resources is also reviewed. Forest laws are primarily concerned with the regulation of timber. Hence, legal and administrative frameworks to regulate the extraction and trade of NTFPs are fragmented and ambiguous.

The objective is to assess how the establishment or destruction of the Park distributes benefits and costs among different stakeholders. A household survey of local communities was undertaken to provide social, economic and ecological data. The paper determines the costs and benefits of three management options: (1) The experimental park scenario corresponds to the base case where some level of protection is achieved, but fisheries eventually collapse; (2) the ghost park scenario assumes that all timber and fish are harvested, destroying the area; (3) the dream park scenario only allows subsistence activities, recreation, education and research. At a 10% discount rate, the dream park has the highest net present value (US $11.9 million). This compares with US $10.0 million for the ghost park and US $9.8 million for the experimental park. Although the dream park scenario has the highest net present value, it exceeds that of the ghost park by less than US $2.0 million. However, protection scenarios allocate the bulk of the Park's benefits to local communities. The dream park confers three times more benefit value to villagers compared with the ghost park. Local communities, whose traditional livelihoods depend on the sustainable use of the Park, stand to loose most; commercial loggers and fishing fleets, as well as the Armed Forces, stand to gain most from the wanton exploitation of timber and marine resources. #","aid":113}

The ethical basis of the model is to promote accountability, transparency and responsibility throughout a project's planning and implementation process. Additionally, the CCI model seeks to provide a forum, the CCI seat, for resolving conflicts, developing further partnership and building capacity. It is a decision-making model that is applicable to community-based conservation and partnerships in protected area management. As an adaptive management initiative built on the concept of community conservation, the model is vital for decision-making forums for managing biodiversity at a broad-scale level.

The regular presence of sea lions on the island is not only a touristic attraction in the region, but also a problem to the fishery community. This community faces economic impacts in its activities due to fish depredation caused by sea lions. Because of this issue, the perceptions and attitudes of different stakeholders from the region are important to be considered by managers, so that a realistic and decentralized action plan can be designed. The goal of this study was to analyze how different local stakeholders perceived the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos. Additionally, how these stakeholders differed from each other in terms of attitudes, knowledge and perceptions. In October 2011, January and March 2012, face-to-face interview surveys were conducted with fishermen and tourists, and drop-off questionnaires surveys with business, and tourism professional and teachers, in a total of 150 questionnaires, 30 for each group. The results indicated existence of differences across the five stakeholder groups. It was also suggested that non-direct stakeholders had a more favorable view of the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos and the sea lion, whereas direct stakeholder (the fishermen) saw it as an obstacle to their fisheries activities.","aid":151}

The study area is focused on the surroundings of Lata Jarum and Lata Jarum itself. This area is rich in biodiversity with endemic flora and fauna. A field survey via a structured questionnaire was conducted on 194 village respondents living in the vicinity of Lata Jarum. This is also complemented by observation during field survey. The data were analyzed descriptively. The most significant finding is that the majority have a neutral perception due to a lack of understanding and knowledge about community-based ecotourism. The other findings indicate that both positive perception and negative perception towards community-based ecotourism have a minority perspective. However, the responses for positive perception are larger as compared to the negative perception. The positive perception is mainly due to pecuniary returns whereas those opposing want to maintain the traditional way of life. The concluding remark is that for ecotourism to succeed with effective local community participation, a dual approach i.e. a top-down and bottom-up approach needs to be adopted. Future research on the dual top-down and bottom-up approach including training and development, will help in capacity building.","aid":152}

Introduction Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are among the most threatened ecosystems in the Americas, where they were historically preferred for human settlements and agricultural activities (Maass, 1995; Ewel, 1999). In Brazil, TDFs extend over 27,367,815 ha, representing 3.21% of its territory (Sevilha et al., 2004), predominantly distributed in the semi-arid northeastern region (Fig. 1). As in other parts of the world, Brazilian TDFs are neglected in terms of research and conservation efforts compared to tropical rain forests (Sá nchez-Azofeifa et al., 2005; EspíritoSanto et al., 2006). For this reason, human occupation and land In this study, we review the current available information on the social–ecological context of Brazilian tropical dry forests (TDFs), a vegetation type that covers approximately 3% of the country territory. For this purpose, we conducted a comparative analysis of two case studies, one study in the north of Minas Gerais state and the other in Paranã River Basin, situated in southeastern and central Brazil, respectively. We compiled published bibliographical and census-based data for the two regions, concerning the historical human occupation and land use and the environmental and development policies affecting TDF management and sustainable use. Brazilian TDFs usually occur in semi-arid climates, and have been intensely converted mainly to extensive pasturelands in large farms, thus leading to high income concentration in those areas. Our case studies involve less-developed regions that support populations with very low human development indices, which is the norm for Brazilian TDFs. Many of these are traditional populations, such as indigenous and slave descendents, with peculiar cultural practices only recently considered in government policies proposed for the forest management. Though the two regions have similar land use histories, current social–ecological scenarios are very different. In the north of Minas Gerais, TDF conversion policies were debated intensely for the last 15 years, recently resulting in a state law specifically generated to regulate TDF use. Also, this region has 20 conservation units (CUs), some of them delimited inside the territories of the several traditional populations that inhabit TDF areas. This process caused enduring conflicts that can affect both CUs' effectiveness and the sustenance of these populations. In the Paranã River Basin, there is no specific policy towards TDFs, whose use is regulated by the 43-year-old Brazilian Federal Forest Code. There are only four CUs in this region, and most traditional populations were expelled from their original territories and consequently lost their cultural identity. Government sustainability strategies are limited to the establishment of CUs, a response that may disregard social demands and cultural practices, depending on the local context. Given the uniqueness and threat level to TDFs, specific and more diversified policies towards land use should be established for these ecosystems in order to stimulate low-impact activities that maintain ecosystem services and improve the livelihoods of TDF inhabitants. ß 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. use, deforestation rates and the real status of conservation of the remaining TDF fragments are largely unknown. As a result of the high proportion of valuable timber species and fertile soils where these forests occur, Brazilian TDFs are in high demand for logging and farming, the main drivers of land cover change in this ecosystem (Scariot and Sevilha, 2005; Anaya et al., 2006). Another important threat is the mining of limestone outcrops, which are commonly encountered where TDFs occur. Due to high deforestation rates and their restricted distribution, TDFs can be considered the most threatened ecosystem in Brazil. Large intact areas are now rare, found almost solely in a few conservation units (CUs), due to the local government's limited conservation strategy towards this ecosystem. In the farmland landscape, only small fragments of TDFs remain, most of them disturbed by selective logging and cattle ranching (Sevilha et al., 2004; Sevilha, 2000, 2005). TDF distribution in Brazil includes some of the poorest regions of the country, thus any conservation strategy for these ecosystems must address human welfare and social justice. The predominant model for nature preservation adopted in Brazil is derived from the American concept of protected areas, which is essentially the conservation of ''pieces'' of the natural world in their original state (Arruda, 2000). The primary expression of this concept is the creation of CUs of Restricted Use (equivalent to IUCN categories Ia, II and III), where the only allowed human activities are the tourism, education and scientific research. Frequently these areas of limited access are established in territories historically occupied by vulnerable human populations, precluding their access to natural resources that are essential to their survival. The paradigm of ''sustainable development'' emerged in the late 1980s (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987) and posed an alternative conservation strategy to CUs and the conflicts generated by their creation. In spite of its vagueness (Mebratu, 1998; Robinson, 2004), the concept of sustainable development implies a consensus among economic, social and environmental interests (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987; Robinson, 2004; Teixeira, 2005). However, the Commission's findings are often interpreted as a set of compensatory actions and technical adaptations to legitimate large market-oriented projects, such as agriculture, mining, energy production and the raising of livestock (Zhouri et al., 2005; Leff, 2006). In this sense, sustainable development strategies usually place a high priority on economic growth and devalue social diversity, ignoring traditional management practices of local populations as sustainable forms of land use and poverty alleviation. In order to address sustainability issues for a given region, it is necessary to analyze the social conflicts involving the access to natural resources, which are inevitably inequitable and determined by longstanding practice. This paper aims to understand the social–ecological context of Brazilian TDFs, through the examination of two case studies in the north of Minas Gerais state and the Paranã River basin, situated in southeastern and central Brazil, respectively. These two regions had different human activities over the past several centuries and were subjected to contrasting developmental and environmental policies in the last few decades. Also, they represent some of the most active current frontiers of deforestation and forest degradation in the country. Thus, we compiled published bibliographical and census-based data to revise the available information on the historical occupation and land use in these regions. We also conducted a comparative policy analysis in order to explain the situation of TDFs and of the inhabitants whose livelihoods highly depend upon TDF manage- ment.","aid":153}

Huaying Grand Canyon, Sichuan Province, China","authors":"Fanwei Z.","dAbstract":"In recent years, geoparks (a geoheritage effort to protect geological features) have been vigorously promoted in China and abroad. The evaluation of a geopark is important for geopark development. However, current evaluation methods focus on geoheritage and their values, and often ignore residents' situations, even though community participation is essential to the sustainable development of geoparks. In this paper, the Mt. Huaying Grand Canyon Geological Park was selected as a study area to evaluate resident's perceptions of the park. Perception impact factors were selected from the perspective of the park residents. Quantitative evaluation models, based on data from questionnaires, were created using the hierarchy process model and expert evaluation method. The results showed that the following factors influenced residents' perceptions, listed from the most significant to the least: residents' understanding of geoheritage, participation level in commercial activities, participation level in planning decisions, satisfaction level regarding benefit distribution and level of participation willingness. It was found that residents' level of understanding of geoheritage and their participation level in planning decisions were the main reasons for poorer perceptions of geoheritage. The keys to improving residents' perceptions of geoheritage are to change the management system, implement people-centered policies and to establish a government-led management mode that encourages community participation and involves private business contracts.","aid":162}

This paper contributes to sustainable tourism by presenting local decision-making practices and issues arising from the perspective of the members of one village in the Boum¯ a National Heritage Park, Fiji. It shows that introduced democratic decision-making systems may not contribute to political empower-ment in CBEM and can cause difficult situations. It is argued that greater attention to local systems of governance is required if tourism practitioners are to fully understand decision-making and participation in CBEM. The paper also offers a culturally appropriate methodology that may produce more meaningful outcomes for sustainable tourism research in indigenous Fijian contexts, and in other contexts worldwide. It argues that levels of empowerment should not just be treated as the outcome but as a part of the process of tourism development. It explores the core Fijian cultural concept of vanua as a way of life, involving interrelated social, ecological and spiritual elements. An emic perspective utilising informal talanoa (discussions) is used and examined, along with the roles of kin groups, village spokesmen and clan systems, and their relationship with western business decision-making practices.","aid":164}

More recently, however, parties to CITES have embraced the sustainability discourse and taken steps to address the socioeconomic dimensions of wildlife trade. This paper examines the policies developed by CITES' Parties at four recent meetings, with a view to determining whether they are founded on a holistic understanding of socio-environmental dynamics. It concludes that CITES' conservation approach remains rooted in a conception of sustainability that treats people and wildlife as separate entities, and where species conservation takes priority over human development. Nonetheless, CITES does appear to be moving towards a more all-encompassing perception of sustainability where focus is on ecosystems rather than ensuring the survival of single species.","aid":724}

Coexistence between subsistence farmers and elephants leads to problems for conservation and food security, especially on the edge of protected areas. Crop-raiding patterns have been investigated for decades, but understanding both social and ecological determinants remains a key challenge to defining realistic management options in a context of increasing human and elephant densities. 2. Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, and its periphery, hosts one of the highest densities of free-ranging elephants. As scale is a critical element of ecological systems, we analysed the determinants of crop raiding at three spatial scales: the study area (217 households in 200 km²), the village (30 fields in 14 km²) and the edge of the refuge area (30 fields in less than 3 km²). We combined foraging ecology with sociological approaches, including a partici-patory experiment, to understand the processes behind the susceptibility of subsistence farmers to crop raiding. 3. Distance to refuge area was the most influential determinant in decreasing crop-raiding risk, with no damage occurring further than 4Á4 km. We obtained consistent models between the three scales with high explanatory power for field damage at village and edge scales (94% and 68% respectively). Household density acted as an obstacle to elephants. Millet patches seemed to provide refuges, and thus promoted damage. 4. The participatory experiment allowed rigorous testing of the efficiency of traditional guarding practices. The presence of people was crucial for guarding efficiency. More innovatively, we demonstrated the role of neighbours and the importance of cohesive guarding as a promising strategy of reducing crop loss at the edge, primarily in areas with a high density of elephant paths. 5. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides evidence that multi-scale multidisciplinary approaches can unravel endogenous processes shaping human–elephant coexistence on the edge of protected areas. We believe that manipulating perceived risks for elephants, through mitigation methods based on the 'ecology of fear', and spatial organization of households, could create a 'soft fence' which, when combined with adequate incentives to farmers, promotes a better integration of the protected area in its territory.","aid":228}

Face-to-face interviews, supported by structured questionnaires, were conducted to determine 1) sources of livelihood ; 2) the impact of tourism; and 3) the readiness of rural communities to participate in income-generating activities. Farmers were keen to take up ecotourism and wanted to use the proceeds to increase their livestock herds. However, this would increase pressure on natural resources, causing land degradation. Additionally, income from ecotourism may also lead, in the long run, to social inequality in remote communities.

Because very little is known about the diversity of strategies people employ to deal with these risks, a study was performed in the Mekong Delta across four shrimp farming systems: (1) improved extensive non-forest, (2) mixed mangrove-shrimp, (3) intensive and (4) clustered intensive. The risks and livelihood strategies that were encountered differed systematically across the four farming systems. It was found that the uncertainties that the shrimp farmers faced include limited access rights to the mangrove forest, crop failure due to regular occurrence of shrimp disease, high investment costs and volatile markets for shrimp. Shrimp farmers have created several strategies for coping with these uncertainties, including redesigning farms, producing salt, changing the species farmed from Penaeus monodon to Penaeus vannamei, becoming involved in a cooperative cluster, integrating aquaculture and agriculture, and farming shrimp by organic standards.","aid":239}

Current forest allocation and subcontracting policies of the Vietnamese government with respect to the devolution of forest management and participation of local people in sustainable forest management reflect both environmental and economic concerns. The paper aims at investigating how the devolution of rights over forestland and benefit sharing mechanisms are related to actual rights and the distribution of benefits of forest management practices. The findings show that farmer's decision-making over mangroves is very much influenced by shrimp farming since the income from mangroves is very low compared to that from shrimp. Farmer's decision making over forest is very much influenced by the way in which the benefit sharing policy is implemented by the state-owned forestry companies and management boards. However, their attitudes towards mangrove plantation and protection are far from negative. The study supports the claim that shrimp farmers may well be able to plant, protect and manage mangroves if they have more rights and responsibilities over forests and are able to benefit more from the production of mangroves. In this way more sustainable management of mangrove forests may be promoted.","aid":241}

Assurances that protected areas will provide such benefits are often crucial to attracting the support needed for their creation. But delivering on these promises is seldom easy. In some cases this may mean broadening the scope of benefits delivered by protected areas without undermining what they were set up for in the first place, no simple task. Unless we understand and publicise the full range of benefits from protected areas we risk not only reducing the chances of new protected areas being created but even of seeing some existing protected areas being degazetted and their values lost. This report, the fourth volume in WWF's Arguments for Protection series, looks at the role of protected areas in poverty reduction, in its widest sense. We focus mainly on the poorest countries and on poor communities within those countries. A few examples look at regional development and some also compare the impacts of protected areas in the materially richer countries. Specifically the report seeks to review five linked questions: 񮽙 What is the range of benefits that protected areas can offer? 񮽙 How do these benefits link to poverty reduction strategies? 񮽙 What is the evidence, if any, of protected areas reducing poverty and increasing well-being? 񮽙 What are the prerequisites for protected areas to contribute to poverty reduction? 񮽙 How do the benefits reach the poorest people, if at all? Efforts to align protected areas and poverty reduction have continued for some time and have a mixed history; while some social programmes associated with protected areas have worked well there have also been plenty of failures. Meanwhile the political pressure to show that conservation and poverty reduction can co-exist is growing and some governments are questioning commitments to protection in the face of present economic or social pressures. As investors seek more guarantees or predictability of joint socio-economic and conservation success, implementing agencies are – rightly – being held more accountable for results. The concept of 'protected area' is defined and different management approaches and governance types are described. Protected areas usually have to compete with other demands on land or water. Changing political expectations mean that many stakeholders expect to have a say about whether a protected area is created or not and designation often depends on a complex process of negotiation, trade offs and agreements. To support claims that protected areas can reduce poverty, it is important to have clear definitions of what we mean by 'poverty', 'poverty reduction' and 'well-being'. We review many different definitions, including those from the World Bank, UK Department for International Development (DFID), World Health Organisation, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Summit on Sustainable Development. For the purposes of this report, based on definitions from the OECD and DFID, we recognise five fundamental dimensions of well-being, any improvement in which should contribute to reducing poverty: 񮽙 Subsistence: non-economic benefits that contribute to well-being, i.e. health, nutrition, clean water and shelter 񮽙 Economic: benefits which provide the ability to earn an income, to consume and to have assets 񮽙 Cultural and spiritual: pride in community, confidence, living culture, spiritual freedom, education 񮽙 Environmental services: role in environmental stability and provision of natural resources 񮽙 Political: relating to issues of governance and thus influence in decision-making processes The different types of relationship between local people and protected areas are described, ranging from 'winwin' to 'lose-lose'. We consider whether protected areas can help to reduce poverty, first from the rather narrow perspective of poverty as defined by the World Bank and applied within the Millennium Development Goals (less than one dollar a day) by assessing the economic benefits of protected areas, then by looking at wider definitions of poverty as defined above. The sometimes chequered history of protected areas and local communities is considered as well, looking at poverty reduction in particular. A collection of short examples of economic benefits from protected areas are given in table form. We distinguish between direct and compensatory benefits from protected areas: i.e. benefits that arise because of the intrinsic values of the protected area itself and those that come because governments or others introduce compensation packages for people displaced by or losing resources to protected areas. The different types of values and benefits which protected area can provide in theory and practice (which is not necessarily the same thing) are also described in turn: food and drink, cultural and spiritual values, health and recreation, knowledge, environmental benefits, materials and homeland. Next we use data from work by WWF and others on management effectiveness of protected areas. WWF has carried out over 400 assessments of protected areas, using a simple questionnaire-type tracking tool, and has also assessed over 40 national protected area systems with another rapid assessment system. Both can be used to identify a group of protected areas where managers believe protection has also resulted in better conditions for local communities. WWF is also a major sponsor of a global study of management effectiveness in protected areas coordinated by the University of Queensland, which is assessing several thousand assessments. The combination of these data gives us two things: the largest body of statistical information on management effectiveness of protected areas available to date and a means of identifying a range of protected areas worth looking at in more detail. In addition, we developed our own simple assessment tool, the Protected Area Benefits Assessment Tool, and have used this to help to draw together information for this report and for a series of case studies. Case studies, which look at the issues discussed in the report in greater detail, come from Argentina, Finland, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Poland and Tanzania.

Its Bedouin Support Programme component is designed to provide tangible benefits to the Protec-torate's inhabitants as a means of building their support for, and participation in, the project's conservation initiatives. This paper discusses the process by which the objectives and work plan of the Bedouin Support Programme were established. A gender-balanced nine-person field team, composed of mainland Egyptian and expatriate social scientists and a local Bedouin, conducted extensive discussions with representatives of all tribal groups living within the Protectorate. Bedouins called for assistance in the creation of jobs and income-generating activities, improvement of water supplies, reversal of trends in environmental deterioration , involvement with tourism, and access to health and educational services. They made numerous suggestions for conservation-related activities in which they could participate, including wildlife protection and remote park facility operations. The team then consulted companies and government agencies which would be impacted by, or involved in, the Protectorate's Bedouin-related activities. Using these Bedouin and non-Bedouin perspectives, the team then developed a work plan for Bedouin Support Programme activities, seeking to further Bedouin interests in the areas of natural resource conservation, employment and income generation, the operation of remote park facilities, tourism, training, animal and human health, agriculture, and infrastructure.","aid":291}

One of the Law's articles calls for the creation of a national park system and park administration, which was put into full effect in 1998 with the founding of the SERNAP. Throughout the 1990s and the early 21st century, new national parks were declared, and in many older ones, such as Sajama NP, an administration was put in place for the first time in 1995. Following standard top-down approaches, local acceptance of these national parks was generally non-existent. This was the situation in Sajama NP when, around the turn of the century, SERNAP tried to tackle existing problems in the management of its parks by elaborating principles and policies for managing the national park system and putting in practice its motto of \" parks with people. \" Compared to older conservation practices, SERNAP's philosophy explicitly recognizes the existence of traditional communities within its parks, as well as these populations' rights to The Sajama National Park in Bolivia","aid":293}

They play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of the coastal environment , acting as sources of nutrients to adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems through active and passive transport. We examined the nutrient contents in mangrove and nonmangrove soils in and around the Bhitarkanika National Park, India and assessed whether the local agricultural producers were aware of and placed a value on this contribution of mangrove forests in enhancing agroecosystem productivity. Soil samples from both mangrove and nonmangrove areas were analysed and quantity of organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium were derived. The replacement cost method was used to derive the value of nutrients in mangrove soils. We estimated that each hectare of mangrove contains additional nutrients worth US$232.49 in comparison to nonmangrove areas. The difference in nutrient content in mangrove versus nonmangrove areas gave the value of US$3.37 million for the nutrients in 145 km 2 of mangrove forests. The agricultural producers were aware that mangrove forests act as a source of nutrients and were willing to pay a higher price for the land adjoining mangrove forests. Around 92% of the producers ranked nutrient retention as a secondary function of mangrove forests. Despite crop depredation from wild ungulates and conflict with salt water crocodiles the agricultur-ist finds the benefit to cost ratio of mangrove forests high and more than 76% were in favour of mangrove restoration. This study provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of mangrove ecosystems to the livelihoods of the local people and the urgent need to sustain these through proper policy and market interventions.","aid":315}

This paper quantifies the value of provisioning services of mangrove forests to local livelihoods in terms of forestry and fishery products. To examine the use of mangrove products, 324 households from 36 villages in the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area located in East Coast of India were surveyed using structured questionnaires. For estimating the contribution of mangrove forests to fish productivity, fish production was evaluated in three stages—inshore fishery, offshore fishery and the role of mangrove forests as nursery ground for fish and shellfish. The findings revealed that 14.2% of the fuel need of each household was being met by the forests. Other forestry products used were timber, honey and thatch grass. During the study, 14 species of fish and three of shellfish were recorded. The total catch for inshore fishery was estimated as 3.77 kg h-1 having market price of US$ 2.25. In offshore fishery the number of species caught as well as income from the catch was higher in areas with mangroves (US$ 44.61 h-1) than in those without mangroves (US$ 2.62 h-1). The market price of the forestry and fishery products used by the people was estimated as US$ 107 household-1 annum-1. The resources extracted from mangrove forests contributed to more than 14.5% of the total income of the household. This was around 30% for the households residing in the immediate vicinity of the forests. This study suggests that provisioning services provided by the mangrove forests are of significant importance to the coastal communities as they increase the resilience and sustainability of the local economy.","aid":314}

M. van Zonneveld and co-authors used climate envelope modelling to predict possible shifts in the distribution of two tropical pine species, Pinus kesiya and Pinus merkusii, in Southeast Asia; the aim was not only to anticipate impacts, but also to identify opportunities, such as the potential for pine plantations in areas where they were not previously possible. M. Silveira Wrege et al. used climate vulnerability mapping to predict areas in Brazil where climate change might have the greatest effects on Araucaria angustifolia, so that these areas can be prioritized for conservation activities. A short contribution by M.

Understanding the impacts of conflict on livelihoods and conservation activities is paramount in Goma. The main reasons for resource degradation here are heightened insecurity, theft, and uncertainty, which limit the use of far off land for agriculture. Consequently, most people depended on forest products and fish from protected areas, thereby causing higher risks of depletion of fish and park resources. High population density, few livelihoods alternatives, unpredictability, and weak state apparatus remain serious issues to be considered in resource conservation. La dépendance aux ressources naturelles : les défis d'après-conflit pour la sécurité des moyens d'existence et pour la durabilité environnementale a ` Goma, République Démocra-tique du Congo La haute dépendance aux ressources naturelles a ` Goma pendant la période après-conflit a provo-qué des dégâts sévères au Parc National de Virunga (VNP) et au Lac Kivu. Il est de la plus haute importance que l'on comprenne les effets du conflit sur les moyens d'existence et sur les activités e ´cologiques a ` Goma. Les causes principales de la diminution des ressources dans cette région sont une augmentation de l'insécurité, des vols, et l'incertitude ; ces facteurs réduisent l'exploitation de terres lointaines pour l'agriculture. Par conséquent, la plupart des gens comptaient sur ce qu'ils trouvaient dans les forêts et sur les poissons pêchés dans les zones protégées, ce qui a mené un risque e ´levé de diminution des ressources aquatiques et territoriales au parc national. La densité de la population, le manque d'autres moyens d'existence, l'imprévisibilité et la faiblesse de l'appareil de l'Etat restent des questions primordiales pour la protection des ressources. Dependencia en los recursos naturales: retos del post-conflicto para la seguridad de los medios de vida y la sostenibilidad ambiental en Goma, República Democrática del Congo En el escenario post-conflicto de Goma, se creó una fuerte dependencia de los recursos naturales, la cual provocó daños severos al Parque Nacional de Virunga y al Lago Kivu. Resulta de fundamental importancia comprender los impactos que los conflictos producen en los medios de sustento y en las actividades de conservación en Goma. La creciente inseguridad, el robo y la incertidumbre constituyen las razones principales de la degradación de los recursos debido a que inhiben el uso de tierras lejanas para la agricultura. En consecuencia, la mayoría de las personas depende de pro-ductos forestales y de la pesca en a ´reas protegidas, situación que provoca el aumento del riesgo tanto del agotamiento de peces como de los recursos del parque. Las políticas orientadas a la con-servación de los recursos tendrán que considerar, además, otros temas graves, como lo son la alta densidad poblacional, las pocas alternativas para generar ingresos, la incertidumbre y la débil presencia del Estado. Dependência de recursos naturais: desafios pós-conflito para a segurança dos meios de subsis-tência e sustentabilidade ambiental em Goma, República Democrática do Congo A alta dependência de recursos naturais em Goma, no pós-conflito, causou graves prejuízos para o Virunga National Park (VNP) e Kivu Lake. Compreender os impactos do conflito sobre os meios de subsistência e atividades de conservação e ´ algo crucial em Goma. As principais razões para a degradação dos recursos aqui são o aumento da insegurança, roubo e incerteza, o que limita o uso de terras distantes para a agricultura.

It is widely recognized that the lives of humans and wildlife in this region are inextricably intertwined. However, few studies have attempted to integrate both human and wildlife dimensions using ethnographic data to better contextualize the trade and its ecological impacts. This paper outlines a methodological approach that combines ethnographic research, ecological line transects and market surveys in the Dzanga Sangha Reserve (Central African Republic). Results from each research component are reported separately in order to provide examples of how each would answer specific questions about the status of wildlife populations and the scale of hunting within a protected area. The integrated analysis of ethnographic, market and ecological datasets clarifies synergistic impacts operating in the region and provides a more nuanced understanding of changes in both the forest and the market based on information gleaned from hunting practices and hunter interviews. This research demonstrates the potential pitfalls of using a singular approach to make recommendations on complex human-environment issues. Such cross-disciplinary mixed-methods approaches will further understandings of dynamic wildlife populations and forge more informed environmental policy recommendations.","aid":349}

The study employed focus group meetings, in-depth interviews, and interviews of households, as stratified by wealth class and head of household gender in Copperbelt, Zambia. The results show that FPES are vitally important in providing food, medicine, fodder, and construction materials to rural livelihoods. FPES provided 43.9 % of the average household's income and contributed a 10 % income equalisation effect among households, as revealed by the Gini-coefficient analysis. Poorer households received a lower mean annual income from forests than did their intermediate and wealthy counterparts, but in relative terms, forest income made the greatest contribution to the total household incomes of poor households. When stratified by gender, forests contributed 44.4 and 41.8 % of the income of male-and female-headed households, respectively. The study indicates that wealth, rather than gender , was the key determinant of a household's engagement in the sale of FPES. The inter-and intra-community differentiation in the use and sale of FPES, as revealed in this study, enables more effective targeting of forest management interventions and informs efforts to reconcile the goals of poverty reduction and forest conservation.","aid":354}

We focus on India to discern trends and implications of nature-based tourism in an emerging economy. We interviewed 91% of tourist facilities around 10 PAs to assess visitation, employment, and practices. Average growth rate was 14.9% (from −7% in Bandipur to 44% in Periyar from 2002 to 2008) and 80% are domestic tourists. Many facilities (72% post 2000) are recently constructed and 85% occur within 5 km of PAs. Clustering of facilities in some PAs might facilitate easier management of resource use and establishment of best practice guidelines. Contributions of facilities to local employment are marginal. Rules governing entry of people and vehicles vary widely. Domestic nature-based tourism potentially generates public support for conservation but adds to existing challenges of managing PAs already facing pressure from livelihood needs of local populations. Based on these trends, the increasing middle class in India is likely to generate future demand for nature-based tourism counter to trends in industrialized countries. There is urgent need for establishing and enforcing regulations to manage tourists, resource use, and land-use change around PAs.","aid":942}

Zagros forests cover 6.07 million ha and support rich plant and animal diversity. Changes in local community social and economic systems and the inefficiency of traditional forest management led to a critical situation in the stability of forest regeneration in recent decades. Due to a shortage of productive and arable lands and resulting unemployment and poverty, people overexploited the Zagros forests. Outside intervention in traditional forest management creates conflicts between local peoples and forest management organizations. To achieve sustainable forest management, including forest resources conservation and improvement of natural resource based livelihoods of communities, it is desirable to implement Forestry Incentive Programs (FIP) based on the important functions of forests. Detailed information on the so-cio-economics of communities, the effect of forests on local livelihoods, and lists of products extracted from the forest were obtained from a survey of local communities though questionnaire, interview and observation. We studied 276 households in three villages and completed 76 questionnaires by householders in the quantitative analysis. Sampling was performed by simple random sampling (SRS). The needs of rural communities , such as livestock husbandry, mainly arise from the characteristics and environmental features of villages. We identified the driving forces, pressures, status, impacts and responses (DPSIR) to design incentive programs, by DPSIR analysis and interaction analysis. Evaluation of local community benefits from forests showed that in order to improve forest management, 319 dollars per year would be needed by each family as an incentive in 2010 to prevent lopping and firewood collecting, the main causes of forest degradation.","aid":385}

We analyzed the effects on livelihood capitals to compare in two ways: (1) before and after participation, and (2) participants and non-participants. In Cox's Bazar, there were some significant changes regarding income sources, but annual income was little changed after participation in participatory forestry. Literacy (about 10 % after participation) and mobile phone ownership (75 %) were significantly higher than before. Housing conditions were better (brick walls: 7.5 %; sun-grass roof: 70 %) than those of non-participants (brick walls: 0 %; sun-grass roof: 77.5 %). PF ensured legal rights on forest lands for participants, while non-participants were illegally living on public forestland. However, expenses were considerably higher than income; people were still struggling with poverty and many of them suffered from malnutrition. This ultimately put pressure on all capital. People had redistributed their available capital to cope with adversity, and there was a trend toward involvement in economic activities other than forests. Our study found that social capital was more influenced by PF more than other capitals. Due to the involvement with the PF program, people were feeling much more secure, women had elevated status, and social relationships became stronger.","aid":391}

A total of one hundred and sixty species distributed both in forest reserve and general land were recorded. Local end-uses of NTFPs including fuel wood, food, construction materials, medicine and traditional rites items were identified. This indicated significant contribution of NTFPs to local community income and livelihood resilience and thus, incentive for sustainable forest management. While access to NTFP is important to guarantee the socioeconomic well being of the forest adjacent communities, their sustainable management has not been taken seriously by local government officials and policy makers thereby contributing to reduction of biodiversity resources and irretrievable loss of most species. To ensure the sustainable utilization of NTFPs from Ngumburuni Forest Reserve and similar tropical forest environments, a number of conservation approaches are proposed.","aid":394}

A randomly distributed questionnaire indicated that 94% of fishers believed that without the MIMP, there would be overfishing, dynamite use, destroyed habitats, and few fish. Fishers were more positive about core zones (no-take fishery closures) than general use zones (areas allowing selective fishing) as a consequence of increases in fishing pressure. Those that reported increased catches and sizes of fish since the creation of the MIMP were more likely to agree with present zone locations and more positive in general about fisheries and conservation planning. Most thought that fish size and gear restrictions were preferable to permanent closures. Perceptions differed among communities and gear users. Community and gear type explained 46% of the variance in responses about the perception that fisheries and conservation are compatible goals. Somewhat surprisingly, these effects were more important than catch increases or involvement in MIMP-related activities. The differences in perception between communities may be partly attributed to different fishing histories. Multiple-use zoning provides a means to identify and resolve conflicts and achieve what are likely universal objectives for fisheries sustainability and conservation.","aid":26}

Ninety members of local communities bordering Manyeleti Game Reserve, which is contiguous with Kruger National Park, South Africa were interviewed. Respondents expressed diverging attitudes toward predators, which were more favorable among participants with higher education. Negative views were particularly due to fear of human and livestock losses, especially to lions, Panthera leo. Lions were thought to be the most abundant predator both within and outside the reserve. Lions were also the best known predator and were most often held responsible for killing livestock. Despite these livestock losses and a lack of conservation education, most participants voiced favorable opinions about large carnivore conservation, as predators were considered an integral part of the respondents' natural heritage. Thanks to this cultural tolerance and also because of a largely accepted management policy regarding predator control, large carnivores and people can coexist in the vicinity of Kruger National Park.","aid":413}

{"filename":"Le et al. 2014","year":2014,"title":"What drives the success of reforestation projects in tropical developing countries? The case of the Philippines","authors":"Le H. D. and Smith C. and Herbohn J.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction While tropical deforestation continues at alarmingly high rates, the net loss of forest area globally has slowed from 8.3 million ha per year between 1990 and 2000 to 5.2 million ha per year between 2000 and 2010 (FAO, 2010). This reduction in net loss is mainly due to an increase in afforestation, reforestation, and natural forest regrowth. It appears that a number of tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, whereby there has been a shift from deforestation to net reforestation (Meyfroidt and Lambin, 2011). Reforestation through planting trees on cleared land is an important mechanism that leads to tree cover establishment as reported in the forest transition literature, however reforestation is not a straightforward process that leads invariably to tree cover increase (de Jong, 2010 ). Rather, the outcome of forest rehabilitation itself is influenced by many factors (Chokkalingam et al., 2005; Le et al., 2012). If forest rehabilitation outcomes can be appropriately assessed, and these outcomes linked to forest cover increases, the study of forest rehabilitation could shed light on some of the many complex processes that ultimately result in forest transition (de Jong, 2010). Little information exists to indicate the success of reforestation projects in achieving ecological or socio-economic benefits. Unfortunately, many existing reforestation projects have partially or completely failed, often because the trees that were planted have not survived or have been rapidly destroyed by the same pressures that caused forest loss in the first place. Even when planted trees have survived to maturity, they have not necessarily been welcomed by local communities. Dudley et al. (2005:6) observed that, 'too many restoration projects do not bother to find out what local people really want'. This is a particular problem in the rural areas of developing countries because if reforestation projects do not meet community livelihood needs, then the planted trees will not be respected and will most likely be removed and replaced with agricultural land uses. A number of problems with past reforestation projects can be identified. Reforestation projects have often sought to encourage and sometimes impose tree planting without understanding why the trees disappeared in the first place and without attempting to address the immediate or underlying causes of forest loss (Eckholm, 1979). There has also often been a mismatch between social and ecological goals of reforestation; either reforestation has aimed to fulfil social or economic needs without reference to ecological goals, or it has had a narrow conservation aim without taking into account the social and economic needs of people. For foresters, reforestation traditionally meant establishing trees for a number of functions (wood or pulp production, soil protection). For many conservationists, reforestation is either about restoring original forest cover on degraded areas or about planting corridors of forest to link protected areas. For many interested in social development, the emphasis of reforestation is on establishing trees that are useful for fuel-wood, fruit, or as windbreaks and livestock enclosures. Until now, most reforestation practitioners and ecologists have tended to see their jobs as strictly technical. In reality, however, reforestation is as much a cultural activity as any other human endeavour. As Higgs (1997) has compellingly argued, good reforestation requires a view expanded beyond the technical to include historical, social, cultural, political, aesthetic and moral aspects. Otherwise conflicts may arise when reforestation programs are introduced (Light and Higgs, 1996; Swart et al., 2001). Based on a variety of case studies, the most important socioeconomic requirements for reforestation success appear to be a stable land-use pattern, equitable land-tenure systems, homogeneous human populations (with respect to ethnicity, economics, and so forth), local public involvement, and strong local leadership and participation by government institutions (Karki, 1991; Lamb, 1988). However, the success or failure of reforestation projects cannot be explained by either a single technical or a socioeconomic factor (Aronson et al., 1993; Le et al., 2012; Sayer et al., 2004). Little quantitative research has been conducted on reforestation success drivers and their interactions. Through a comprehensive review of the literature we have identified a list of potential success drivers and grouped these into technical/biophysical drivers; socio-economic drivers; institutional , policy and management drivers; and reforestation project characteristics (Le et al., 2012). In that study, we also identified a large set of indicators that have been used to measure the success of reforestation projects (Fig. 1). A critical shortcoming in our current understanding concerns the relationships between the drivers of reforestation success and the indicators. In some cases these links are relatively clear, for example weed control and grazing management are logical drivers that would affect seedling survival rate (a key indicator of reforestation success). However in many other cases, the links are not clear and there may be many drivers that affect the outcomes of reforestation in unknown or unexpected ways.

F.","dAbstract":"How users perceive the performance of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is fundamental for the social acceptance of these zones. Moreover, their perceptions may be relevant for monitoring the effects of MPAs on extractive activities. This study analyzes artisanal fishers' perceptions of the performance of a northwestern Mediterranean coastal MPA, which encompasses two no-take zones (NTZs). Three viewpoints have been considered: the effect on the personal activity of fishers, the effect on the local fishery and the effect on the ecosystem. In order to test the hypothesis that biomass export (spillover) – which had previously been evidenced from the two NTZs – may influence fishers' perceptions of NTZ effects, fishers' perceptions were compared with both declared and observed fishing activity over an one-year period. The results show that negative perceptions of NTZs are either nil or are negligible. Most fishers are aware of the beneficial effects of NTZs on ecosystems and fisheries. However, they remain to be convinced of the beneficial effects of the NTZs on their own activity. For instance, the proximity of a NTZ appears never to be involved in the choice of a fishing spot. This partial lack of correspondence between scientific expectation and fishers' perceptions is discussed in the light of fishing habits in the zone adjacent to NTZs, and takes into account fishing grounds, targeted species and seniority (defined as the number of years the fisher has been fishing within the MPA). All three factors appear to influence fishers' perceptions. For example, having a positive perception about a NTZ and spending more time fishing in the adjacent zone are habits that can be associated with fishers with less seniority. Fishers' perceptions obviously indicate the social acceptance of the MPA and are an essential monitoring tool for MPA managers. However, perceptions cannot be seen as a substitute for scientific monitoring, as both approaches are clearly complementary.","aid":954}

P.","dAbstract":"Forest cover in Sri Lanka has decreased rapidly during the last century and only fragments of the once widespread natural forest cover remain. This paper analyzes forest cover change and small scale farmers' relation to natural forests around two protected forest areas in Sri Lanka; Kanneliya Forest Reserve and Knuckles Conservation Forest. Methods used are spatial analysis to observe changes in forest cover from the 1980s until 2010, interviews with small scale farmers and key informants as well as field observations. In Kanneliya Forest Reserve, a decrease in forest cover is observed, particularly due to population increase and expanding tea plantations. In Knuckles Conservation Forest on the other hand, we find an overall increase in forest cover due to expansion of tree plantations, a ban on shifting cultivation and emigration from the area followed by natural forest regeneration. Agriculture is the most common source of income in both study areas and there is a clear link between conversions of forests to agricultural expansion. The profits from agricultural activities are in general insufficient to sustain small scale farmers' needs and the most common alternative source of income is achieved through resources extracted from the forest. Since 2001, demarcation of forest boundaries around the two forest reserves has reduced encroachment and illegal felling of timber. However, this policy has simultaneously threatened the livelihoods of peripheral communities in the forest buffer zones, especially in the investigated villages around Knuckles Conservation Forest. Despite successful attempts to reduce deforestation rates through governmental interventions, further incorporation of local people into the management of forests as stipulated in the current forest policy should be continued.","aid":961}

This paper analyses the strategies of adjustment implemented by members of two flood-prone communities in Puerto Rico, and discusses how the adoption of these strategies and other factors could influence future adaptive capacity and vulnerability to floods. Semi-structured interviews with community members from different resource endowment groups were used to elicit the resources behind the process of adjustment along with additional factors that could influence future adaptive capacity, including their perceptions of risks related to floods. The analysis revealed how access to resources – including material, economic and human resources – has facilitated living with floods in these communities; although not everyone has been able to adapt in the same way. Past actions, along with public responses being undertaken in the area (i.e. flood control project and upstream structural modifications) appear to be reducing flood-risk perceptions and promoting a false sense of security among community members, irrespective of resource endowment group. For that reason, developing ways to increase awareness about future flood potential and making clear the need for complementary non-structural strategies is imperative. In short, the research findings emphasise that access to resources and cognitive factors are important determinants of adaptive capacity. Hence, both should be taken into account while developing practical strategies towards increasing adaptive capacity and reducing vulnerability to floods specifically, and to other natural hazards in general.","aid":965}

There is an often implicit assumption that PGIS use is effective, in that it meets content needs, satisfies underlying local stakeholder interests and therefore is a tool for better governance. The analytical framework looks at participatory spatial planning performance with respect to key dimensions of governance, especially the intensity of community participation and empowerment, equity within communities and between 'governed' and 'governing', respect for indigenous knowledge, rights, ownership, legitimacy, and effectiveness. Specific development focus is given by a case study using participatory mapping and PGIS in community forest legitimization, planning and management in Tinto, Cameroon. 'Good governance' criteria are applied ex-post to the implementation procedures, the geo-information outputs, and the longer-term outcomes of the PGIS processes. Impacts of incorporating PGIS were examined in terms of the types and degrees of participation in the process; access to, and the uses made of, the geographic information; whether the information outputs met stakeholders' requirements; and the overall changes in equity and empowerment in the community. It was found that PGIS/participatory mapping processes contributed – positively, though not comprehensively – to good governance, by improving dialogue, redistributing resource access and control rights – though not always equitably – legitimizing and using local knowledge, exposing local stakeholders to geospatial analysis, and creating some actor empowerment through training. PGIS promoted empowerment by supporting community members' participation in decision-making and actions, and by enabling land use planning decisions beyond community forestry itself.","aid":488}

Children's responses revealed that they had a general knowledge of wildlife but knew few details about specific species. Respondents thought that wildlife was important but were nonetheless tolerant of several forms of environmental exploitation. Visits by conservation organizations , Conservation International and Foster Parrots, were shown to increase appreciation of wildlife and the need to set up more protected areas, but unless programmes were concentrated and sustained they had little effect on attitudes towards environmental utilization and exploitation. Experience of the natural world in terms of owning a domestic animal or pet, having visited a zoo, or being a member of a wildlife club had little impact on children's knowledge of wildlife and did not change attitudes to utilization and exploitation. Surprisingly, Guyanese children did not have particularly positive views about classic flagship species, such as jaguars, giant anteaters and tapirs, when compared to other species. Our findings suggest that zoos, wildlife clubs and conservation organizations could enhance the dissemination of their message through making more frequent and sustained visits, imparting more detailed knowledge, and exposing children to the potential dangers of utilization and exploitation; also that conservation organizations should reassess their use of standard flagship species in South America.","aid":552}

They include the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP), and the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjing (DCBT). While there have been studies of these programs, many questions remain to be examined concerning why the programs have been initiated, whether they have been effectively implemented, what their induced socioeconomic and ecological impacts are, and how their performance can be improved. To address these overarching questions, my colleagues from the Forest Economics and Development Research Center (FEDRC) of the Chinese State Forestry Administration and Michigan State University (MSU) and I organized an international symposium in Beijing, on October 19, 2007. It included invited speeches and panel discussions as well as refereed presentations, many of which featured ongoing research projects undertaken by scholars from MSU, FEDRC, and their partners. After the symposium, I decided to edit a book based on the conference presentations , and the presenters and their associates have worked hard to prepare their manuscripts for the book in a timely manner. Our consensus was that getting these papers quickly published in a single volume would highlight the research advances in assessing China's ecological restoration programs and thus provide a major source of literature, conceptual frameworks, models, and tools for continued assessment of the programs, particularly integrated assessment of the socioeconomic and environmental impacts. If time proves that this book has indeed made a valuable contribution in this regard, then our intention will have realized, for which my colleagues and I will be grateful. As its editor, I will take responsibility for any not so well articulated or elaborated arguments and language errors. The book, containing 14 chapters, addresses a wide range of issues. It begins with an up-to-date description of China's ecological restoration programs (ERPs, Chapter 1 ) and an extensive survey of the literature that has assessed the implementation efficacy and impact significance of these programs (Chapter 2). Then it presents the research methodology of integrative assessment that my collaborators and I have adopted (Chapter 3) and a case study of detecting the land use and land cover changes (LUCC) induced by implementing the programs (Chapter 4). Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted to modeling the driving forces of the historical LUCC in the upper Yangtze. Chapters 7 and 8 are attempts to quantify the potential ecological impacts on carbon dynamics and soil erosion. The remaining chapters are efforts to estimate the socioeconomic impacts of the programs, as reflected in income, employment, and other dimensions of livelihoods. In describing China's ERPs, Chapter 1 covers their initiation, implementation, and challenges. Overall, it appears that with the substantial government investment, tremendous progress has been made in implementing the ERPs. For instance, the forest area and volume have expanded significantly with the implementation of the NFPP. Similarly, under the SLCP a large amount of degraded farmland and grassland has been rehabilitated, and the forest and grass coverage has expanded substantially. As a result, the ecological and socioeconomic conditions have seen improvement. To complete their implementation successfully and to fundamentally improve the ecosystem functions and services, however, the authors argue that it is essential for China to embrace a more balanced and comprehensive approach to ecological restoration, adopt better planning and management practices , emphasize local people's active engagement, strengthen the governance of project implementation, establish an independent and competent monitoring network , and conduct timely and high-quality assessments of the program effectiveness and impacts. In addition to reviewing the literature on assessing the implementation efficacy and impact significance of the ERPs, Chapter 2 also outlines several directions for future research. In a nutshell, it finds that: (1) the implementation effectiveness has not been examined as extensively as the impact significance; (2) efforts to assess the impact significance have concentrated on the SLCP, particularly its socioeconomic effects: growth of income, alternative industry, and employment, and likelihood of re-conversion; and (3) most of the socioeconomic studies are based on rural household surveys, and discrete choice and difference in differences models. Future work should thus pay more attention to the NFPP and other programs, and the environmental impacts and the implementation effectiveness of all of them. To these ends, the authors recommend that analysts gather more field data regarding the evolving ecosystem conditions and socioeconomic information of higher aggregation, and conduct their research across scales, with better application of geospatial technology and more effective collaboration. In presenting their research methodology of integrative assessment, the authors of Chapter 3 first call for embracing both environmental and socioeconomic changes and engaging investigations at multiple scales and through interdisciplinary collaboration with expertise from ecology, economics, hydrology, and geospatial, climate , and land change sciences. Echoing some of the recommendations made in Chapter 2, they further argue that the deployment of geospatial capability, the use of longitudinal data, and the connection between science and policy should be the hallmarks of an integrative assessment. Then, they outline their general approach and specific models to quantifying the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the ERPs, and to addressing the issue of how to overcome the challenges in generating the data needed for executing various empirical tasks. The authors hold Preface ix that the adoption and application of this methodology will lead to a more rigorous and systematic assessment as well as implementation of the ecological restoration programs in China. Chapter 4 reports the land cover changes in northeast China from the late 1970s to 2004. Even though land use statistics from governmental sources exist, their availability and reliability are not promising. Coupled with the fact that the geospatial technology is now not only well advanced but also cost effective, this led to the authors' decision to identify the regional LUCC using remote sensing and the Geographic Information System. Their results are very encouraging. It is found that while forestland and wetland were greatly reduced until 2000 due to farmland expansion and urbanization, spurred by the population and economic growth, their declining trends have been revered most recently. Meanwhile, built-up land has continued to increase. Further, the land cover changes occurred primarily in areas with low elevation and gentle slope. These findings suggest that the forest and wetland protection and restoration projects have indeed taken effect. However, the authors warn that there remains a long way to go before the ecosystems are greatly recovered and can function in the way that society expects. Chapters 5 and 6 are attempts to modeling the driving forces of the LUCC in the upper Yangtze basin, aiming to shed light on human impacts on the LUCC and environmental conditions. In Chapter 5, the authors use a fractional logit model to determine the effects of social, economic, and institutional factors on the changes of cropland, forestland, and grassland. Based on a panel dataset covering 31 counties over four time periods from 1975 to 2000, they show that population expansion, food self-sufficiency, and better market access drove cropland expansion, while industrial development contributed significantly to the increase of forestland and the decrease of other land uses. Similarly, stable tenure had a positive effect on forest protection. In addition to highlighting the main LUCC drivers, this chapter also illustrates the limitations of the conventional choice models. To gain a better knowledge of the complex interactions of human and natural drivers underlying the LUCC, Chapter 6 creates a system of simultaneous equations to capture the dynamic linkages, feedback , and endogeneity of the determinants. This novel structural model of land use focuses on the multiple dimensions of agriculture – not only cropland use itself, but also grain production, soil erosion, and related technical change. The results show that technical change plays an important role in supplying food on a limited cropland ; limiting cropland expansion in turn reduces soil erosion, which then benefits grain production in the longer term. It is also found that policies and institutions have significant impacts on land use change and the status of soil erosion. Together, these results carry some important implications for sustainable land use and ecosystem management. The alternative modeling strategies are beneficial to improved knowledge of the drivers. Chapters 7 and 8 are estimations of the changes in carbon storage and soil erosion based on ecosystem simulation models. Quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and carbon fluxes between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere is critical to understanding the regional patterns of carbon storage and loss. In Chapter 7, the authors use the General x Preface Ensemble Biogeochemical Modeling System to simulate the terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics in the Jinsha watershed of the upper Yangtze basin, based on a unique combination of spatial and temporal dynamics of such major factors as climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, and LUCC. It shows that the Jinsha watershed ecosystems acted as a carbon sink during the period of 1975–2000, with an average rate of 0.36 Mg/ha/yr, primarily resulting from regional climate variation and local LUCC. Vegetation biomass accumulation accounted for 90.6% of the sink. While soil organic carbon loss before 1992 led to a lower net gain of carbon in the watershed, soils became a small sink thereafter. The carbon sink/source pattern had a high degree of spatial heterogeneity, with sinks associated with forest areas without disturbances and sources caused by stand-replacing disturbances. This underlies the importance of land-use history in determining the regional carbon sink/source pattern. Land degradation caused by serious soil erosion has made the Loess Plateau one of the poorest regions in China. To improve the environmental conditions, the government has taken a number of measures there, including the SLCP. A natural question to ask thus is whether and to what extent it has actually accomplished the designed objective. Chapter 8 answers this question, concentrating on the soil erosion dynamics in the Zuli River basin. The authors do so by adopting a distributed soil erosion model to simulate the changes of water runoff and soil erosion induced by implementing the SLCP, with the assistance of remote sensing and GIS technologies for parameterization of the land surface attributes. Their simulations show that the improved ground cover, especially forestland and grassland, has resulted in an erosion reduction of 38.8%, compared to the mean level of the 1990s. On the other hand, the changed rainfall pattern has caused soil erosion to increase by 13.1%. In combination, the authors obtain a net decrease of soil erosion by 25.7% in recent years. This evidence suggests that China's ecological restoration efforts have effectively mitigated the regional water and soil loss. Chapters 9–14 constitute studies of the different socioeconomic impacts of the ERPs – with different sample sites, datasets, and modeling approaches. While most of these chapters feature various versions of the difference-in-differences (DID) model and panel data, one chapter estimates the aggregate NFPP impacts using an input-output model and another measures the agricultural productivity change induced by the SLCP. The authors of Chapter 9 note that the ERPs are often designed with dual goals: to enhance ecosystem services and to alleviate poverty; however, reaching both can be challenging. If the household's supply of ecosystem services is not positively correlated with poverty, tradeoffs may exist between meeting the two goals. Moreover, even if the supply of ecosystem services and poverty were positively correlated, cost-conscious program managers need to adopt targeting approaches such that the poorer households with land that is less costly to set aside and provides a higher environmental benefit are selected. To explore strategies by which both the environmental and poverty alleviation objectives of a program can be achieved cost effectively, they develop a conceptual framework to understand the implications of alternative targeting when policy makers have both environmental and poverty alleviation goals. Using the SLCP as a study case, Preface xi they then evaluate what factors determine the selection of program areas. Having demonstrated the heterogeneity of parcels and households, they examine the correlations across households and their parcels in terms of their potential environmental benefits, opportunity costs of participating, and the asset levels of households as an indicator of poverty. Finally, they compare alternative targeting criteria and simulate their performances in terms of cost effectiveness in meeting both the environmental and poverty alleviation goals when given a fixed budget. It is found that there is a substantial gain in the cost effectiveness of the program by targeting parcels based on the \" gold standard, \" – targeting parcels with low opportunity cost and high environmental benefit managed by poorer households. In Chapter 10, the authors hypothesize that in addition to participation status and household characteristics, the SLCP's impacts on income growth and labor transfer are determined by the local economic conditions, program extent, and political leadership; and the income impacts may vary from sector to sector. To test these propositions, they compiled a dataset of 600 households in three counties of the Loess Plateau region, with observations for times both prior to and after the program initiation (1999 and 2006), both aggregate and categorical incomes, and both participating and non-participating households. Using a simple DID model, they find that participation status, economic condition, program extent, and political leadership have all had significant impacts on household income and off-farm employment. Also, the effects of participation on crop production income, animal husbandry income, and off-farm income vary substantially. Obviously, these results have great policy meanings regarding how to improve the effectiveness and impacts of the ERP in China. In Chapter 11, the authors assess the impact of the NFPP on local household livelihoods. To that end, they apply a series of policy evaluation microeconometric techniques to quantify the program's effects on two interrelated facets of household livelihoods: income and off-farm labour supply. They find that the NFPP has had a negative impact on incomes from timber harvesting, due to logging restrictions. However, they show that off-farm labor supply has increased more rapidly in NFPP areas than in non-NFPP areas. As such, the NFPP has actually had a positive impact on total household incomes from all sources. Furthermore, this result is strongest for employment outside the village. On the basis of these results, the authors also offer an intriguing discussion concerning how to mitigate the negative impact of the program and strengthen its positive impact on household livelihoods. China's ecological restoration programs, which are sometimes referred to as \" the Priority Forestry Programs, \" or PFPs, also include the Wildlife Conservation and the Nature Reserve Development Program (WCNR) and the Shelterbelt Development Program (SBDP). In addition to improving the environmental and resource conditions, a frequently reiterated goal of these PFPs is to enhance the income of rural residents. Thus, a question of common interest is: How has implementing the PFPs affected the farmers' income and poverty status? The task of Chapter 12 is to address this question, using a fixed-effects model and panel data from over 2,100 households in ten counties of Sichuan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Jiangxi. The evidence indicates that their effects are mixed. The impacts of the SLCP, the NFPP, and the concerns and to improve its environmental conditions, China has been undertaking several major ecological restoration efforts (EREs), including the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP), the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), and the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjin (DCBT). These EREs represent large-scale, transformational changes and will have profound environmental and socioeconomic impacts both domestically and internationally (Forest and Grassland Taskforce of China, 2003;). A few studies have investigated the early implementation of these programs, their preliminary impacts, and the perceived problems in carrying them forward. For instance, was one of the earliest efforts that summarize the essentials, progress, and effects of the NFPP and SLCP. The authors also commented on the challenges facing the programs. Similarly, reported the implementation of these two programs, reviewed the patchy evidence of their effects, and suggested steps for improving their effectiveness, including systematic planning, diversified funding, effective compensation, integrated research, and comprehensive monitoring. In addition, presented a synopsis of these and other programs and then related them to the latest forest tenure reform and other policy initiatives of the Chinese government. Undoubtedly, China's experiences and lessons of ecological restoration are of broad interest and a lot has been learned of the NFPP and the SLCP from these and other studies. Nonetheless, China's EREs are not limited to the NFPP and the SLCP (), and a complete documentation and a timely updating of all the major efforts are still missing in the literature, which are not conducive to gauging the scope of these programs and the scale of their impacts. Additionally, a more thorough and critical deliberation of the relevant policy and technical measures remains urgently needed for improving the implementation of these programs. The purpose of this paper is to tackle these tasks and thereby to advance the international understanding and to facilitate the execution of China's EREs. Before proceeding, it should be noted that because of space limitation and potential diffusion of attention, we have decided not to review the literature that has assessed the socioeconomic and ecological impacts of the EREs here. 1 Furthermore , given that our tasks are to narrate the basic contents of the programs and their progress and to discuss the major issues encountered in their execution, a number of the statistics will be drawn from official sources and a largely descriptive analysis will suffice. The paper is organized as follows: In the remainder of this section, we will provide the historic background, against which China's EREs were launched; then, we will present their key elements and implementation in the next two sections; finally, we will address the critical issues that China faces in successfully completing these programs and fundamentally improving its ecosystem functions and services. After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, large tracts of primary natural forests remained in the northeast, southwest, and a few other places. Later, most of these forests were nationalized and 136 state-owned forest bureaus were gradually set up in these forests to produce timber to spur the young economy (SFA, 2001). Along with this strategy of resource exploitation, the old governance system came into play, under which the state enterprises lacked incentive and autonomy to manage and utilize the resources efficiently (Yin, 1998). Since logging was the main, or even the sole, revenue source and the forest bureaus had to assume the heavy burden of providing almost all of the social services for their workforce, over-cutting became prevalent and regeneration and management were neglected. At the same time, population growth and demand for employment in these forest regions led to more fuelwood consumption, housing construction, and land clearing . Consequently, China's natural forests were quickly depleted (Liu, 2002). The over-cutting and under-management also resulted in structural deterioration of the forests, as reflected in reduced stocking volume, imbalanced age structure, altered species composition, and low growth rate (Yin, 1998). Unfortunately, the ecological environment in the rural society was even worse. The collectivization in the 1950s discouraged people from tree-planting and forest management. Soon after, as part of the attempt to industrialize, a campaign to increase steel production took place during the Great Leap Forward. In many cases, even backyard furnaces fueled by wood charcoal were deployed for that purpose (Yin, 1994). Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, forest and grassland conversion to other uses was also carried out under the chronic crisis of grain shortages on the one hand and the national policy of food self-sufficiency on the other. These malpractices resulted in severe destruction of vegetation and deforestation. Also, farming on steep slopes became common due to demographic explosion and lapses in regulation (Du, 2001). Coupled with uneven rainfalls and rugged terrains, this led to a substantially reduced ecosystem capacity to regulate water flows and to contain soil erosion (Lu et al., 2002). These factors were deemed to be the primary reasons for the record dry-up of the Yellow River in 1997 and the widespread flooding in the Yangtze basin in 1998 (Xu & Cao, 2001). Another disaster has been the loss of grass cover and desertification in the west, driven by uncontrolled grazing, poor maintenance of rangeland, and human-induced decline of water tables (). To be sure, the Chinese government made attempts to combat the growing environmental problems in the past, but the record of their effectiveness was utterly disappointing. Since 1978, for instance, a number of afforestation projects has been launched ( ). Despite their broad geographic reach and remarkable planting efforts, public investments were limited, and the efforts were rarely followed through (Smil, 1993). Often, sites were poorly prepared, seeds and/or seedlings were not properly planted, and saplings were not well tended. Therefore, these forestry projects have failed miserably in delivering the expected environmental benefits. Similar problems have hindered the efforts to curb farming on slopes (Xu & Cao, 2001). In addition, having gained economic independence from the rural reforms, many farmers aggressively sought new croplands, just like herders hastily increased their livestock (Du, 2001). Oftentimes, this meant that a large number of the more sensitive patches on steeper slopes were claimed, and a great amount of the grassland in the arid and semi-arid regions was overgrazed. In short, the successive occurrences of ecological disasters in the late 1990s indicated that China's historic efforts to protect ecosystems had not improved the overall ecological conditions and more decisive and forceful measures are thus called for to bring the problems under control. It was against this backdrop that the new EREs were launched and the existing ones consolidated. The State Forestry Administration (hereafter, SFA), prompted by the ecological disasters and charged by the State Council, proposed the NFPP in 1998 as a large-scale scheme to protect most of the natural forests and, then, the SCLP in 1999 to convert croplands on slopes and desertified fields back to forestland, grassland, and wetland on an even larger scale. 2 Moreover, China has indeed been carrying out four other programs: the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjin, the Shelterbelt Network Development Program, the Wildlife Conservation and Nature Reserves Protection Program, and the Industrial Timberland Plantation Program (SFA, 2002). Altogether , they are designated by the SFA as the \" Six Priority Forestry Programs \" of ecological restoration and resource expansion and are incorporated into the national economic development and environmental protection plans (SFA, 2007;). 3 The Chinese government hopes that these programs will not only greatly improve the domestic resource and ecological conditions as well as rural livelihoods, but also significantly contribute to regional and global environmental causes ( ). The total investment in these programs over this decade will easily top 500 billion yuan (). 4","aid":553}

Employing key‐informant interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation, we look at how one community has perceived the conservation actions in their village, Boumba, Niger, and the neighbouring national park, Park‐W. This study examines local perceptions of the goals, priorities and methods of conservation in Park‐W and the Boumba region. We demonstrate that while participants expressed positive alignment with perceived conservation goals, they did not agree with conservation priorities and felt strongly against the methods. Reframing conservation discourse in the terms of sustainable‐use or adaptive management may serve to help translate much of the conservation ethic to local realities.

This paper reports an empirical study of the Upland Settlement Project (USP) of Bangladesh which was undertaken to prevent land degradation and enhance the standard of living of the people. Planters were found to have given up shifting cultivation and adopted soil conserving agroforestry practices, and forest coverage has been increased in the project village. Interacting with project staff members, government officials and NGOs assisted planters in diversifying livelihood strategies thereby reducing dependency on project resources. Rich planters, utilizing their own capacity, expanded their income sources successfully. Poor planters still remain wage labourers because they do not have sufficient finance and networks to invest in productive ventures. Planters' participation in project activities and the information flow between them and project staff were found to be minimal. Suggestions are made for the continuity of project functions, which involve greater participation of planters in rubber management functions, improved information flow, resolution of land tenure and greater equality in distribution of rubber revenue.","aid":573}

There are now only 15 planters in the project village and, although agroforestry has progressed well, only 30 to 40% of poor quality rubber trees remain. Planter participation in project activities was limited to wage labour, indicating that the USP failed to adequately achieve all its proposed objectives. In the face of project failure, planters have adopted diversified strategies to maintain their livelihoods. Several shortcomings caused failure of the project, such as the inability of project staff members to organize planters, failure to create awareness among planters about project benefits, lack of regular project money disbursement, sociocultural ignorance , and lack of social capital among planters.

The forest villagers are well-endowed with all the elements of a sustainable livelihoods framework, though human capital in terms of education is not satisfactory. Strong social capital, stable natural capital and a productive market-oriented agroforestry system facilitate the generation of financial and physical capital that make the livelihoods of Khasia people sustainable.

It may not be possible, for example, to create or maintain employment and generate increasing volumes of revenue for government whilst also sustaining stocks and biodiversity. Two approaches to fisheries management, one focused on capturing wealth and limiting access and the other on maintaining access for employment and providing community development and welfare, present contrasting policy advice, with different points of emphases and objectives. This article examines the case of Lake Victoria, where the three main commercial fisheries are seen to contribute to different objectives for the lake's fisheries. Insights from the debate between wealth-based and welfare-based approaches to fisheries management provide a framework for the analysis of fisheries policy and practice on the lake. From the analysis, it is concluded that whilst there is much rhetoric in support of a wealth-based approach, this has not been followed through in implementation, reflecting the lack of political support for new taxation and limiting access. The welfare functions of the fisheries are significant, but could be substantially strengthened through greater investment in the provision of services to fisheries communities. The approaches are not mutually exclusive , but pursuing wealth-based management must support livelihoods, employment and development, as well as fisheries management objectives. Without the incorporation of welfare objectives, fisheries policies will not be politically accepted or fully implemented, suggesting the need for a balance between wealth and welfare objectives and measures.","aid":589}

The aim was to study dependency, involvement and attitude towards forest protection based on gender and caste. A conceptual model indicating differences between the groups was used as a base. Women experienced more problems of restrictions caused by the protection and more threats associated with the forest than did men. Voting in meetings and a wish for more plantations was of greater importance for women than for men, while men emphasised importance of cooperation with government. Direct involvement was very low among women, even though they were well informed about forest issues. Tribal groups were the main contributers of labour, while general caste had been involved for considerably longer in forest protection than other groups. The tribal groups also wanted more plantations and had a good understanding of the ecosystem. For example, they indicated the value of a growing forest. Men and general caste tended to be more outspoken in this type of questionnaire situation compared to women and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The general attitude towards Dhani Hill, however, was positive and could be linked to daily use and future optimism. This optimism and the involvement of all the different groups should be considered as crucial in the timing of local forest management interventions.

The study analysed NTFP collection and management practices under government and community forest management systems, and impact of these practices on the status of forest and NTFPs. The analysis based on people's perception revealed that NTFPs were being depleted more rapidly than timber components in both types of forest. The pace of depletion was, however, considerably lower in community forests, as these forests were accessible only to the relevant forest user group members.

The tenure reform clarity and strengthening of tenure rights at community level through various CBFM programs in Nepal in the last few decades has enhanced opportunities for the rural people to benefit from forest-based enterprises. However, a key concerns as these programs have advanced over the years has been whether the poor benefit from them given their high dependence on the forests. To examine this question, 28 CBFE from Nepal's mid-hills and mountain districts were selected purposively from among forest user groups (FUGs) engaged in income-generating activities, varying in their size of membership, use of forest products and stage of growth. These CBFEs have been broadly categorised into FUGs, networks, cooperatives and companies. The contribution from enterprises to the household economy was found to be greatest from companies, followed by cooperatives and then networks. The effective practices of the CBFEs in increasing income benefits were found to include representation of the poor and marginalized groups in executive committees in the FUGs-based enterprises, targeted employment of the poorest in the collection of non-timber forest products and in processing units in networks, and enabling the poor to own share capital in cooperatives and companies.

Major international donor agencies sponsor programs to empower and strengthen the capacity of local communities to manage their natural resources, while concurrently improving livelihood opportunities. We surveyed 205 randomly selected households throughout the project area to assess the factors that influence household participation roles in management and management groups, and to evaluate how benefits from program involvement were distributed among the community. Overall, the distribution of benefits was unequal: households with higher level participation roles had increased access to financial credit and capacity development trainings. Social variables such as age, level of education among head of households, the highest level education among household adults, and household size predicted participation. The region is economically homogeneous; therefore, economic factors such as remittances, off-farm income and the quantity of landholdings or livestock did not predict household participation roles. Our results demonstrate the importance of targeting and empowering disadvantaged households in decentralized conservation programs, including educating members about the relationship between participation and equitable distribution of benefits.

The potential of these areas to contribute to the global conservation of biodiversity is significant, given that statutory protected areas alone will not suffice. Nevertheless, there is still inadequate support for private conservation areas, and further research on appropriate, flexible, and generally applicable incentive measures is necessary. We conducted 25 semistructured interviews with the owners of private conservation areas in the Little Karoo, South Africa, to examine landowner opinions of existing conservation policies and their relationships with the local conservation authority. We also assessed landowner preferences regarding conservation incentive measures. Landowners doubted the conservation authority's capacity to implement its stewardship program and were also discouraged by the bureaucracy of the program. The conservation authority was often viewed negatively, except where landowners had experienced personal contact from conservation staff or where strong social capital had formed among landowners. Landowners did not desire financial rewards for their conservation efforts, but sought recognition of their stewardship role and greater involvement from the conservation authority through personal contact. We conclude that conservation policies for private lands could benefit from the provision of extension services to landowners, promotion of formation of groups of landowners and other stakeholders, and public acknowledgment of the contributions private conservation areas make.

This paper demonstrates how the governance of nature through sedentarization, the creation of national parks as a mechanism of forestry conservation and the failure to endorse standard environmental safeguards in the creation of the Tchad-Cameroon pipeline project have led to the devastation of the livelihood of the indigenous pygmies. Simultaneously, by categorizing the Pygmies as a 'primitive other' despite the very dynamism of the concept of culture, the state of Cameroon has excluded them from the benefits of postmodernist development. I demonstrate that projects aimed at modernizing them, and achieving sustainability have instead accentuated their exclusion because of their presumed cultural isolation, led to their deep entrenchment in poverty and resulted in complete erasure. The failure of these projects is due to the clash between global and local perspectives and interests over the Western protectionism and nature aesthetics that underpin conservation and development schemes, and the government's failure to ensure that developers fulfill their obligations to affected communities, as well as the non-recognition of the multiplex relationships between hunter-gatherers and farmers that is based on cultural, historical and political ecology. Against this backdrop, development has thus, become a process of erasure in which the livelihood of the Pygmies has been balkanized and their cultural existence and identity, negated.","aid":613}

N.","dAbstract":"The present and future well-being of the world's forest dwelling populations depends on their ability to gain livelihood resources from their immediate environment. Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products has been promoted by conserva-tionists and development agencies as a feasible strategy for forest dwellers that does not compromise the resource base. Yet surveys of actual resource use suggest that for poorer resource-dependent communities without access to markets, non-timber forest products can only ever represent a safety-net activity and a supplementary income source. Others argue that resource availability, in terms of the diversity and productivity of the forest, is the key parameter in realizing a contribution of forest products to well-being. This paper examines the scope and heterogeneity of forest product use to reveal whether resource availability necessarily provides the context for significant contributions to well-being of forest dwellers. We present data from an area of tropical rainforest, close to Iquitos in Peru, which was previously shown to have high potential value. We find, through a census survey of households within a forest reserve area, that non-timber forest products provide only a relatively small portion of income and that only a small proportion of available products are actually commercialized , despite apparent market availability. We show that the low rates of commercialization can be explained by unequal access capital assets used for extraction, to natural resources themselves , and to product markets. They are also explained by the concentration of capital-poor households on subsistence gathering activities. The value of destructive uses of forests, both logging and agriculture, remain higher than returns from non-timber products. This research demonstrates that although non-timber forest products are an important livelihood source, market integration and commercialization is not everywhere an appropriate or realistic strategy.","aid":1060}

Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil, Camer-oon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unac-knowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation. Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on NTFP availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to light demanding species that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the potential for enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests.","aid":640}

However, research on cooperation has demonstrated that increased market access and income may strengthen or weaken cooperation. Because cooperation is essential for community resilience in small-scale societies, negative effects on people's well-being can be expected if increased NTFP trade reduces cooperation. To evaluate whether NTFP trade affected cooperation, we used household data (survey and systematic observations) to compare the frequency of cooperation in two communities of Brazilian Amazon Caboclos, one of which engaged in NTFP trade, while the other did not. Cooperation was less frequent in the community trading NTFPs, but neither household cash income nor household participation in NTFP exploitation was associated with cooperative behavior. Decreased frequency most likely derived from indirect effects of NTFP trade, such as less time to fish or socialize, or other outcomes observable only at the community level, such as income inequality, the influx of new residents and consequent population growth. Our results indicate that conservation and development projects based on NTFP trade may negatively impact social and economic well-being of local communities.","aid":641}

This paper outlines a methodological approach that combines ethnographic research, ecological line transects and market surveys in the Dzanga Sangha Reserve (Central African Republic). Results from each research component are reported separately in order to provide examples of how each would answer specific questions about the status of wildlife populations and the scale of hunting within a protected area. The integrated analysis of ethnographic, market and ecological datasets clarifies synergistic impacts operating in the region and provides a more nuanced understanding of changes in both the forest and the market based on information gleaned from hunting practices and hunter interviews. This research demonstrates the potential pitfalls of using a singular approach to make recommendations on complex human-environment issues. Such cross-disciplinary mixed-methods approaches will further understandings of dynamic wildlife populations and forge more informed environmental policy recommendations.","aid":349}

PES is a market-oriented approach to environmental management and conservation that attaches an economic value to the provision of environmental services, which is compensated through voluntary payments, in cash or in kind (e.g., Duncan 2006; Wunder 2005 ). Proponents of PES argue that these schemes will foster resource conservation as long as environmental service users are prepared to pay adequate compensation to secure services, and environmental service providers are incentivized to continue generating these services in return for compensation, rather than pursuing other income-generating activities that might degrade them (e.g., FAO 2011; Pagiola et al. 2005 ). In this way, PES schemes seek to create mechanisms to enable bargaining and transactions between environmental service users and providers that are in both parties' interests: in other words, internalizing what would otherwise be an externality (Pagiola 2008;). The concept of PES has attracted much attention for its potential application in addressing the pressing issues of ecosystem conservation and poverty alleviation in developing countries (e.g., Duncan 2006; FAO 2011; UNEP=IUCN 2007). Much of this attention is based on the premise that poor, and mostly rural, groups often inhabit crucial ecosystems, and that payments (especially in cash) for safeguarding ecosystems and environmental services can form important sources of income that may improve their livelihood strategies (FAO 2007; Grieg-Gran et al. 2005 Muradian et al. 2010; Porras et al. 2008; Rosa et al. 2003; Zilberman et al. 2008). Some authors have stressed the need to ensure that any benefits from PES are equitably distributed among low-income groups (Rosa et al. 2003), that compensation replaces or improves income earned from previous land uses (Farley et al. 2011), and that institutional arrangements are put in place to ensure these benefits accrue in practice (Gran et al. 2005; Vatn 2010). These concerns around equity have led to a consideration of the broader benefits of PES schemes beyond monetary payments, to security of land tenure (although this sometimes is a prerequisite for participation), improved internal organization, enhancement of social capital, and more effective natural resource management (Lee and Mahanty 2007; Muradian et al. 2010; Rosa et al. 2003; Wunder 2008). Nevertheless, much literature has treated PES as a technical-economic intervention whose effectiveness depends on the adequacy of project design, nature of implementation, institutional capacity building, and economic calculation and planning. What is missing from many of these analyses are the ways in which social relations and dynamics between stakeholders—and especially between poor rural communities providing environmental services and the downstream users or third","aid":643}

The second study aim was to explore forest-dependent communities' (FDCs) perceptions about their participation in management and conservation practices. The Schlager and Ostrom theoretical framework was adopted to examine the role of potential ownership variations in a common property resource regime. A survey of 412 FDC households was undertaken. Current management by the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD) does not result in implementation of mandated mangrove conservation practices. It was found that allocation of property rights to FDCs would be expected to increase conservation practices. 92% of respondents expressed the view that the evidenced rapid degradation over the past 30 years was due primarily to corruption in the BFD. About half of FDCs (46%) surveyed are willing to participate in mangrove conservation through involvement in management as proprietors. Consistent with Schlager and Ostrom's theory, the results indicate the necessity for de facto and de jure ownership and management change from a state to common property regime to ensure FDCs' participation in conservation practices.","aid":647}

Bolivia, a land-locked country in the heart of South America, is extraordinary in many ways. With fewer than eight people per square kilometer , it is among the most sparsely populated countries in the New World tropics (FAO, 2001). Only the Guianas are less densely populated. Poverty in Bolivia is among the highest in South America, with over two thirds of the population classified as \" living in poverty \" (World Bank, 1996), demonstrating that an economy based on exploiting our natural resources has not provided adequately for our inhabitants. Roughly 55% of the Bolivian population is of indigenous heritage, which is the highest proportion of indigenous people in any South American country (Gonzalez, 1994). Large expanses of forest ecosystems remain intact, especially in northern Bolivia where many areas are uninhabited or sparsely populated by indigenous peoples, although probably a third to half of this forest cover has been exploited by selective cutting of valuable mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King). Along with Guyana, Bolivia has the lowest rate of forest loss among the Amazonian countries (FAO, 2001). In the northwestern part of Bolivia, Madidi National Park, the area where Eco Bolivia has focused most of its work, is an extraordinary area even within such a unique country. Madidi National Park covers 1.89 million hectares (4.725 million acres), which is roughly the size of New Jersey. It occupies part of the \" Tropical Andes \" biodiversity hotspot, considered by Myers et al. (2000) to be a \" hyper-hot \" candidate for conservation due to the exceptional number of endemic plants and animals found within it. The park covers several different ecosystem types, from 6,000 m (19,000 ft) tall glacial peaks and high altiplano, through grasslands, dry forests and cloud forests, and down into lowland rainforests and seasonally flooding savannahs at a mere 600 ft above sea level. With such great variety in altitude, rainfall, and topography, Madidi represents an area that is undeniably one of the most species rich terrains in the world, and may have the highest biodiversity of any protected area on the planet (Parker & Bailey, 1991). Madidi National Park also contains tremendous cultural diversity. In and around Madidi there are indigenous people of Quechua, Aymara, Tacana, Esse Ejja, Leco, Moseten, Chiman, and Araona origins. Each of these groups maintains a unique native language and has vastly differing traditions and knowledge arising out of many centuries inhabiting these lands. One of the goals I had in establishing the limits that I recommended for Madidi was to draw together other areas that, at least officially, were protected areas, as well as areas that were or should become indigenous territories. Madidi thus borders two protected areas in Peru, and three national protected areas, three indigenous territories, and two proposed indigenous territories in Bolivia. Since its creation, a municipal park has been added to its borders. Today the \" Global Community \" is increasingly aware of the importance of both conserving natural resources and helping indigenous communities survive in this new era. The two causes have largely converged over the past couple of decades as conservationists and indigenous groups have increasingly recognized their mutual interests (Beltrán, 2000; Stevens, 1997; Davis & Wali, 1994; Kleymeyer, 1994; Poole, 1993; Durning, 1992; COICA, 1989; Poole, 1989; Brownrigg, 1985; Clad, 1985). Now almost every hectare of Amazonian forest and every indigenous group is considered a valuable resource to the conservation world, and money is made available to conserve these lands and help the people who inhabit them. It would appear that everyone supports conservation efforts these days: the Bolivian government, foreign governments, multilateral agencies, businesses, international non-governmental organizations and foundations . . . the list goes on and on. In a very short span of time, significant funding has been made available for conservation. And yet, from our local perspective, it is becoming increasingly difficult to implement good community-based conservation strategies. Why is this happening? Whereas conservation was integrated into many traditional cultures as a way of life, western Keynotemodels of \" progress \" have challenged these models. Local efforts to regain control of our regions are now being upstaged by big projects being implemented by outside \" experts. \" My purpose here is to give a frank account of our experience in the hope of identifying the problems and aiming towards solu- tions.","aid":1076}

We analysed local mitiga-tion techniques and propose possible measures to reduce human–elephant conflicts. For four protected areas in Bangladesh, we investigated how people interact with elephants and other crop-damaging species. Crop-damaging species differed from site to site, but elephants were generally the most frequent offenders. Although some people were able to control crop damage caused by other wildlife, damage caused by wild elephants was mostly uncontrollable. Forest villagers were somewhat tolerant of damage caused by other wildlife but they were not tolerant of damage caused by wild elephants. Tolerance of crop damage caused by wildlife other than wild elephants tended to increase with distance of respondents from protected areas. Non-tolerance of crop damage caused by wildlife was more common in southeast Bangladesh than in the north. Habitat destruction, caused by high population growth and poverty, appeared to be a major cause for increasing human–elephant conflict. There is an urgent need for adoption of an umbrella strategy (e.g. estimate the size of elephant populations, develop landscape-scale conservation plans and create forest buffer zones under community-based natural resource management schemes) in the use of conflict mitigation as a conservation tool for Asian elephants.","aid":654}

Through lectures, case studies and participatory rural appraisal exercises, the courses emphasized the development of skills for tuning principles of people participation to the conservation objectives of PAs. The present study reviews the trainees' evaluations of these courses, to appreciate their relevance and support their further development. Diploma students judged the course as highly relevant because of the acquired analytical skills, whereas certificate students considered them only of medium relevance. The response to short refresher courses varied as a function of the use of cases from either the trainees' professional experience or from the fieldwork location. The reactions of trainees to this learning opportunity show that PA personnel are not 'attitude-limited' as often suggested. Their constraints to develop a more people-oriented work style lie largely in the areas of knowledge and skills.

The question of who gets access to rejuvenated lands is often highly political, however. Environmental managers \" reclaim \" land resources by rehabilitating them, but they simultaneously reanimate struggles over property rights in the process, allowing specific groups of resource users to literally and figuratively \" reclaim \" the land. Relying on data gathered during fourteen months of field work between 1989 and 1995, this paper analyzes the openings created by environmental policy reforms introduced over the past two decades along The Gambia River Basin, and the tactics and strategies rural Gambians have developed to manipulate these policies for personal gain. Specifically, I demonstrate how women market gardeners pressed \" secondary \" usufruct rights to great advantage to ease the economic impact of persistent drought conditions for the better part of a decade, only to have male lineage heads and community leaders \" reclaim \" the resources in question through donor-generated agroforestry and soil and water management projects.

Introduction The marine aquarium trade supplies aquarium keepers with ornamental species such as fish, corals, sea anemones, crustaceans, echinoderms and polychaetes. Although the real volume is unknown, it has been estimated that 14–30 million fish from over 1800 species, 1.5 million live stony corals, and 9–10 million other vertebrates are traded annually [1,2]. Over 90% of all ornamental species are caught in the coral reefs of at least 45 countries including Brazil, the Maldives, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and the United States (Hawaii). More than two thirds of all organisms come from Indonesia and the Philippines [3]. Main importer is the United States with over 60%, followed by the European Union and Japan [2,4]. The catching of ornamental fish started in Sri Lanka in the 1930s [5]. Through the 1950s, it extended in the Philippines and Hawaii. By the 1980 s, the collection of ornamental species had already spread throughout large parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific islands, and the Caribbean [1] . Over the last two decades, technological developments in the aquarium industry promoted a shift in preferences from simple fish-only tanks towards the creation of marine reef mini-ecosystems [6]. This caused a sharp increase in the demand for marine ornamentals, especially invertebrates [1,7]. By the early 2000, the marine aquarium trade was already a multimillion dollar industry with an estimated global value of 200–330 million USD per year [8]. From ocean to aquarium, marine ornamentals pass through a complex supply chain represented by collectors, middlemen, exporters, importers, retailers, and final buyers. Values of organisms increase throughout the supply chain, but only a very small amount of the profit goes to the collector [8,9]. Nonetheless, it has been argued that catching of marine ornamentals could potentially create significant benefits to low-income coastal communities, especially in regions where other income alternatives are largely absent [8,10]. But until now, there is little empirical evidence for a contribution of ornamental fishing to the livelihoods of local resource collectors. A recent study from Indonesia has shown that fishing for marine ornamentals was part of a wider marine resource use portfolio, and that income from ornamental fishing varies substantially between individual fishermen [11]. Indonesia's neighbour Papua New Guinea (PNG) did only recently join the marine aquarium trade. Papua New Guinea has more than 40,000 km 2 of coral reefs to a depth of 30 m [12]. These reefs belong to the most species diverse ecosystems in the world [13]. Exploitation of marine resources is for the most part limited to small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries. While coral reefs and their associated marine resources in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have been heavily impacted by overexploitation and destructive fishing activities, Papua New Guinea's reefs still remain comparatively pristine. This makes them an interesting location also for catching marine ornamental species. Until 2007, the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) of Papua New Guinea was opposed to the involvement of the country in the marine aquarium trade. Negative impacts associated with the collection of marine ornamentals had raised concerns about the sustainability of this activity. High mortality of organisms caused by poor catching and holding equipment [9], detrimental effects upon targeted populations caused by selective catching and over- exploitation [14,15], and the loss of corals after the application of cyanide [16] are major issues in this respect. However, a number of large marine aquarium retailers had contacted the NFA and expressed their interest in establishing the marine ornamental trade also in PNG. In 2007, the National Fisheries Authority contracted a US-based consultancy to conduct a first assessment of marine resources of potential interested for the aquarium trade. This consultancy was later developed into a three year project under the name \" Sea Sustainable Marine Aquarium Resources Trade \" (SeaSmart Programme ). A total budget of 5 million USD was spent by the NFA in order to develop a sustainable approach to marine ornamental fishing that was supposed to generate benefits to local fishing communities while avoiding the negative ecological consequences listed above. In this article, the results of the SeaSmart Programme are evaluated. The overall outcomes of the project in establishing the marine aquarium trade in Papua New Guinea are assessed, target species are listed, and their collection and handling is described. The main focus of this analysis, however, is on the local collectors, and on the impacts of this new activity on them and their communities. Specifically, (1) the general characteristics of marine ornamental fishers and their communities are described; (2) the benefits from collecting marine ornamentals are assessed and their contribution to household income is quantified; and (3) the perceptions on the impacts of the SeaSmart Programme on household and community level are gathered.","aid":1101}

In India over 50 million people are believed to be directly dependent upon NTFPs for their subsistence. However, such human dependence on NTFPs for livelihood gains (win) has most frequently been at a certain ecological cost (lose). If livelihoods are to be maintained, the existing 'win-lose' settings have to be steered to a 'win-win' mode, otherwise, there could be severe erosion of the biological resources and loss of livelihoods ('lose-lose'). Examining the dependence of forest fringe communities on NTFPs at three sites in south India with contrasting human and ecological settings, three key factors (extent of dependence on NTFPs, indigenous ecological knowledge and market organization) are likely to constrain reaching the win-win situation. How these factors shape the ecological cost of harvesting NTFPs at the three sites is examined. Within the parameter space of these factors, it is possible to predict outcomes and associations that will conform to win-win or win-lose situations. Empirical data derived from the three study sites demonstrate the causality of the observed associations. The key for long-term livelihood gains lies in reducing the ecological cost. Certain interventions and recommendations that could optimize the balance between livelihood gains and ecological cost are proposed.","aid":721}

To improve the adequacy of conservation strategies where chimpanzees live alongside people, it is essential to understand not only chimpanzee behavior and ecology [Hockings, 2007; McLennan & Hill, 2010; Naughton‐ Treves, 1998; Tweheyo et al., 2005] but also how people perceive chimpanzees and behave towards them [Costa, 2010; Hill, 2004; Hill & Webber, 2010; Kohler, 2005; McLennan & Hill, 2012; Nyanganji et al., 2010]. Recent ethnoprimatological research has emphasized the necessary dialogue between the disciplines of ecology and social anthropology in primate conservation [Fuentes & Hockings, 2010; Lee, 2010; Sousa & Frazão‐Moreira, 2010] . Understanding peoples' knowledge and perceptions about chimpanzees should be the first step towards conservation. In addition, environmental education has been mentioned frequently as an important component of conservation strategies [e.g., Casanova & Sousa, 2007; IUCN/UNEP/WWF, 1991], given that the success of conservation programs depends on local people's ability to implement them [Bonine et al., 2003 [Bonine et al., : 1209. Where chimpanzees live in proximity to agricultural communities, they can raid a large variety of crops [Hockings & McLennan, 2012]—a behavior that promotes close interactions with humans [Hill, 1997 [Hill, , 2000. Human–chimpanzee interactions are described as positive in certain circumstances [Hockings & Sousa, 2012], but negative interactions have been reported more widely [Costa, 2010; Halloran et al., 2013; Hockings et al., 2009; McLennan, 2008; Richards, 2000]. Deforestation is said to promote negative interactions between humans and chimpanzees and therefore shape negative perceptions of chimpanzees [McLennan, 2008]. Local perceptions of chimpanzees as \" the property of researchers \" can also generate negative attitudes towards the species [Naughton‐Treves, 1997]. On the other hand, in some African countries, chimpanzees are generally not seen as food for people, because of their status as a human‐like species [McLennan, 2008; McLennan & Hill, 2012] and as \" human‐like \" and \" respectful \" , but \" dangerous \" , as described at Budongo forest (Uganda) [Hill & Webber, 2010]. In Cantanhez National Park in Guinea‐Bissau, Casanova et al. [in press], Costa [2010] and Costa et al. [2013] reported that the species is considered \" ugly \" and \" inedible \" . It is suggested that aesthetics and edibility might be associated in perceptions of wildlife species [Casanova et al., in press].","aid":1122}

E. and Wegge P. and Y.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION A key component in many countries' conservation strategies has long been the establishment of national parks and other forms of protected areas, so that more than 8,500 protected areas, which together cover about 800 million hectares, are now found practically throughout the world (WRI, 1994). A large number of these protected areas have been established in developing countries, but the needs and aspirations of rural people living next to them have been largely overlooked when implementing conservation strategies. Successful conservation has in fact often been linked to the need to protect natural areas from traditional use by local people (Zube & Busch, 1990 ). Rural villagers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the establishment of protected areas, as they depend primarily on locally available resources for their physical livelihood and spiritual needs (Shiva et al, 1982; Gadgil, 1990; Mishra e? a/., 1992). Crop-raiding and -predation by park wildlife may further increase the problems of securing a sustainable livelihood for people living next to these areas. Wild animals' entry to agricultural lands may lead to various forms of damage, e.g. from crop-loss by raiding and destruction, prevention of farmers from using arable land due to fear of crop damage, livestock depredation by park animals, and harassment and injuries to local people. In addition, guarding and the construction and maintenance of various protective measures bear heavy indirect costs owing to the time and financial investments involved. In the rapidly-emerging literature on park-people relations, frequent references are made to crop damage as a major source of conflict between resident people and protected areas (Kiss, 1990; West & Brechin, 1991). On the Indian subcontinent Schultz (1986), and Johnsingh & Panwar (1992), document the seriousness of crop damage and human injuries by wild Elephants (Elephas maximus). However, as stated by Schultz (1986) , accurate information on crop damage by other wild animals is scarce . About 11% of Nepal's land area is designated as national parks or otherwise protected areas (IUCN, 1993). In the Terai (lowland) region of this otherwise mountainous country, five large areas have been designated national parks or protected areas, and from a conservation point of view the outcome has proved successful (Mishra et al., 1992). Villagers living adjacent to these parks, etc., are allowed to collect grass within their boundaries for thatching. This is allowed during a yearly two-weeks' period towards compensation for the denial to use traditional resources of the national parks and otherwise protected areas and for damage caused by wildlife (Heinen & Kattel, 1992). Park authorities have also assisted local development efforts by providing timber for construction of local schools and bridges, diverting park rivers for irrigation purposes, and also various other activities. However, recent studies suggest that conflicts between conservation interests and local development are increasing in areas adjacent to Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) (Milton & Binney, 1980; Lehmkuhl etal., 1988; Jnawali, 1989; Sharma, 1990; Mishra et al., 1992; Heinen, 1993; Nepal & Weber, 1993; Sharma & Shaw, 1993). Heinen (1993) discussed park-people relations in Kosi Tappu Wildlife Reserve in eastern Terai. In the more sparsely populated and less researched western Terai, the results of recent observation indicates increasing conflicts adjacent to the Royal Bardia National Park (RBNP) as well (Khatri, 1993; Leisure & Mehta, 1993; Sasthre, 1993), but conclusive data are scarce. The objectives of this paper are to (i) quantify the extent of crop damage and livestock predation by park animals in villages adjacent to RBNP, and (ii) discuss strategies employed by affected farmers to minimize the problem.","aid":689}

Partly in response to this failure, a number of marine reserves managed by the private sector, Hotel Managed Marine Reserves (HMMRs), have recently been established. In this study, we investigate changes to the social and economic conditions faced by local fishermen, following the establishment of two small reserves adjacent to a hotel in Vietnam, as well as their perceptions of the reserves' ability to produce spillover. The findings are used to gauge management performance and effectiveness of the HMMRs. Two surveys with different survey designs, targeting fishermen with different fishing techniques, produced conflicting results. Fishermen mainly dependent on beach seining mostly opposed the HMMRs and the prospect of more protected areas being established. Fishermen using other fishing techniques were generally in favor of the HMMRs, welcoming more protection and confirming spillover of fish, including large food fishes.","aid":1136}

The influence of a number of factors, including socioeconomic characteristics, perception of coral resources state of health and attitudes towards non-compliance with regulations are analysed. During May 2006, 640 questionnaires were distributed to school children around Reunion Island, Western Indian Ocean, for completion by their parents, following an informal educational activity made in school. From a 73% (n ¼ 469) response rate, results showed that 78% of participants were in favour of the MPA. Analysis further identified that those supportive of the MPA were generally from higher socio-professional categories, had a negative perception of the coral reef ecosystem's health and were not originally from Reunion. In contrast, locals (born in Reunion) from lower socio-professional categories or with no employment activity and having a positive perception of the health status of coral reefs offered no opinion on the MPA. Attitudes towards enforcement and compliance highlighted that SCUBA divers, fishers and jet skiers attributed a higher value to the protection of the coral reef environment through enforcement of MPA regulations than to their own use of the coral reef resource. When asked about the use of penalties to deter non-compliance, swimmers were awarded the lowest fines, followed by SCUBA divers, fishers then jet skiers being awarded the highest fines. Thus, the more severe the act of non-compliance by a resource user group was perceived to be, the more these users themselves disapproved of non-compliant behaviour and supported use of high penalties. The survey design through focusing on school children's parents, demonstrated a simple and cost-effective method for data collection while providing environmental education, which could be employed in similar case studies elsewhere.","aid":null}

Management capacity in protected areas depends upon the system of go-vernance, the level of resources and local community support. The key question of interest at the global level are whether the responsible authorities have the capacity to manage their protected areas effectively, and whether desired outcomes are achieved on the ground. Measuring these dimensions is contextual; what is effective in one country or locale may be inappropriate in another. Thus, assessing management capacity is context specific. The potential declaration of Tara National Park located in Serbia as a Biosphere Reserve necessitated research to characterize the institutional context , the social and demographic situation of the communities within the Park boundaries. There is a growing recognition that the sustainable management of protected areas ultimately depends on the cooperation and support of the local people. In order to achieve sustainable conservation, state legislators and environmental planners should involve local people in the management of protected areas and need to identify and promote social processes that enable local communities to conserve and enhance biodiversity as a part of their livelihood system. Drawing upon research in Tara National Park, this paper analyzes the potential capacity of people living within Tara National Park to effectively participate in the management of the protected area by incorporating activities that promote biodiversity within their everyday livelihood strategies. The results demonstrate that sustaining or providing alternative livelihood strategies is necessary in order to halt the exploitation of protected areas by local people striving to survive.

The paper focuses on livelihoods' strategies and diversification in the context of overexploitation and exhaustion of near-shore resources in relation to fishery policies. The results show that overexploitation is unavoidable in near-shore waters because of the lack of enforcement of fishery regulations for offshore vessels and the limitation of alternative sources of income and opportunities for livelihood diversification for small-scale fishers.

Current forest allocation and subcontracting policies of the Vietnamese government with respect to the devolution of forest management and participation of local people in sustainable forest management reflect both environmental and economic concerns. The paper aims at investigating how the devolution of rights over forestland and benefit sharing mechanisms are related to actual rights and the distribution of benefits of forest management practices. The findings show that farmer's decision-making over mangroves is very much influenced by shrimp farming since the income from mangroves is very low compared to that from shrimp. Farmer's decision making over forest is very much influenced by the way in which the benefit sharing policy is implemented by the state-owned forestry companies and management boards. However, their attitudes towards mangrove plantation and protection are far from negative. The study supports the claim that shrimp farmers may well be able to plant, protect and manage mangroves if they have more rights and responsibilities over forests and are able to benefit more from the production of mangroves. In this way more sustainable management of mangrove forests may be promoted.","aid":241}

Policy makers assume that people are antagonistic toward conserving crocodiles in the wild and think that the enforcement of environmental legislation in a context of widespread rural poverty is illegitimate and ineffective. They argue that these negative public attitudes can only be transformed by generating revenues for rural communities, for example, through crocodile ranching or ecotourism. Despite the evident failure to conserve crocodiles in the wild, this thinking continues to underpin policy and practice in the Philippines. A community-based conservation project in the northern Sierra Madre on Luzon puts this utilitarian logic in perspective. The project succeeded in transforming hostile attitudes toward crocodiles and mobilized broad societal support for the protection of the Philippine crocodile and its freshwater habitat. Cultural values, such as pride in the occurrence of this rare and iconic species, form an important incentive for people to support the preservation of the species in the wild. These experiences highlight the importance of moving beyond ideological positions in discussions on biodiversity conservation, and enable the design of integrative and innovative solutions to conserve wildlife in human-dominated landscapes.","aid":1178}
{"filename":"Van Vliet 2010","year":2010,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION People living in landscapes of high conservation importance are trapped between their dependence on natural resources to meet their local development aspirations and the international pressure to conserve these resources with high international value. This dynamic is particularly apparent with the establishment and management of national parks and other types of protected areas, as they represent the cornerstone of most biodiversity conservation strategies (Stevens 1997, Brechin et al. 2003). In the past, some conservation initiatives have ignored the need to take into account local development aspirations to meet conservation goals and have sometimes clearly undermined human rights and livelihoods through restriction of access, displacement, or oppressive enforcement measures (Brockington 1999, Cernea 2000, Schmidt-Soltau 2005, Brockington and Igoe 2006, Cernea and SchmidtSoltau 2006, West and Brechin 1991 However, it is increasingly recognized that conservation of some natural resources cannot be accomplished without providing alternative solutions for local communities depending on these resources for income and subsistence. In 2003, the World Parks Congress resolved that the social costs of protected-area establishment should be fully compensated (International Union for the Conservation ofNature 2003). The Seventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity called for an assessment of the economic and socio-cultural costs for local communities arising from the establishment and maintenance of protected areas, and an adjustment of policies to ensure that such costs and impacts are equitably compensated (Convention on Biodiversity 2004). To conform to these international resolutions, landscape managers and conservationists are increasingly challenged with integrating social rights and development aspirations into meeting conservation goals. Organizations with the primary mission of conservation have more recently adopted forms of integrated conservation and development approaches (Campbell and Vainio-Mattila 2003), or a more explicit rights-based approach (Campese et al. 2007). Rather than a concentration on protected areas alone, a more integrated landscape approach that aims to achieve both biodiversity conservation and development outcomes is becoming more widely adopted (Wells et al. 2004). This shift toward more participatory processes to achieve conservation goals and with a landscape-level focus could be a significant step toward more equitable and successful conservation. However, global experiences illustrate that successful \" integration \" of conservation and development continues to be elusive, and synergies between conservation and development do not emerge naturally (Barrett et al. 2005). Either compensation measures have no clear link to the impact of conservation on local livelihoods and, therefore, lead to a loss of resilience of local communities (Robinson and Redford 2004, Sayer and Campbell 2004, Wells et al. 2004), or they are not directly conditioned by the provision of environmental services and, therefore, lead to disastrous effects on biodiversity conservation. Other sources of failure are: the disconnection in time frames between conservation and development activities, and the lack of assessment of external risks such as markets, climate change, or the political context, that can destroy conservation and development efforts by significantly influencing local strategies to move in unpredictable directions beyond the coping range of social–ecological systems. The concepts of resilience and vulnerability provide a useful framework for analyzing how to improve compensation measures in the context of conservation and development. The resilience knowledge domain is grounded in ecology and mathematics with a focus on theoretical models, whereas the vulnerability and adaptation knowledge domains are grounded in geography and natural hazards research. The key parameters of vulnerability and resilience are: exposure, that is, the stress to which a system is exposed; sensitivity, that is, the degree to which the system can be influenced by sources of exposure; and adaptive capacity, that is, the capacity to recover a stable state after exposure to external stimuli. A focus on \" practical adaptation \" is increasingly common in the field of climate change research but, to our knowledge, the term is not yet used in the field of conservation and development projects. By \" practical adaptation, \" we mean research that investigates the adaptive capacity of a particular community to identify means of implementing adaptation initiatives (Smit and Wandel 2006). In the context of climate change, exposure is linked to natural disasters caused by climate variability, whereas in the context of conservation and development projects, community exposure is caused by changes in access to natural resources and livelihood options. The vulnerability and resilience of local livelihoods depends on people's \" baseline \" conditions in terms of nutrition, health, morale, and other aspects of well-being; their own efforts and strategies to reinforce their livelihoods; their access to proper support by government or civil-society institutions; and their social and political networks, including social and political capital. Participatory vulnerability assessments aim to document the ways in which the community experiences changing conditions. The focus is on conditions that are important to the community rather than those assumed to be important by researchers or other experts. We adapted the approach proposed by Smit Ecology and Society 15(2): 6 http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol15/iss2/art6/Fig. 1.

In both periods more than two-thirds of the carcasses sold were of rodents and ungulates. From 2002 to 2008–2009 the number of carcasses increased by 44% but the equivalent biomass by only 16% because of a significant decrease in medium-sized species (10–50 kg) and an increase in small species (, 10 kg). The number of carcasses of large species increased between the two periods and those of diurnal monkeys increased fourfold. In both periods smoked bushmeat was one of the cheapest sources of protein available year-round, together with caterpillars, which were only available during the rainy season, and pork. Prices of other domestic meat were significantly higher.

We investigated the relation between bushmeat hunting and household wealth and protein consumption in 2 rural communities in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. One village was dedicated to commercial hunting, the other trapped game primarily for food. We tested whether commercial-hunter households were nutritionally advantaged over subsistence-hunter households due to their higher income from the bushmeat trade and greater access to wild-animal protein. We conducted bushmeat-offtake surveys in both villages (captures by hunters and carcasses arriving to each village). Mammals (including threatened primates: black colobus [Colobus satanas], Preussi's guenon [Allochrocebus preussi], and russet-eared guenon [Cercopithecus erythrotis]), birds, and reptiles were hunted. The blue duiker (Philantomba monticola), giant pouched rat (Cricetomys emini), and brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus africanus) contributed almost all the animal biomass hunted, consumed, or sold in both villages. Monkeys and Ogilbyi's duikers (Cephalophus ogilbyi) were hunted only by commercial hunters. Commercial hunters generated a mean of US$2000/year from bushmeat sales. Households with commercial hunters were on average wealthier, generated more income, spent more money on nonessential goods, and bought more products they did not grow. By contrast, households with subsistence hunters spent less on market items, spent more on essential products, and grew more of their own food. Despite these differences, average consumption of vegetable protein and domestic meat and bushmeat protein did not differ between villages. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the socioeconomic and nutritional context of commercial and subsistence bushmeat hunting to correctly interpret ways of reducing their effects on threatened species and to enable the sustainable offtake of more productive taxa. Resumen: En´En´ Africa Central y Occidental la fauna silvestre es una fuente de ingresos y alimento. Investig-amos la relación entre la carne de caza, la economía familiar y la ingesta de proteínas en dos comunidades rurales en la Isla de Bioko, Guinea Ecuatorial. Una aldea se dedicaba a la caza comercial mientras que la otra cazaba principalmente para autoconsumo. Comprobamos si las familias que practicaban la caza comercial tenían ventajas nutricionales sobre las familias que practicaba una caza de subsistencia debido a sus mayores ingresos por el comercio de la carne y mayor acceso a proteínas procedentes de la fauna silvestre. Realizamos encuestas para conocer la extracción de carne de caza en ambas aldeas (capturas por cazadores y piezas que llegaban a cada aldea). Se cazaron mamíferos (incluyendo primates amenazados: colobo negro Colobus 577 satanas, cercopitecos de Preuss Allochrocebus preussi y cercopitecos de orejas rojas Cercopithecus erythrotis), aves y reptiles. El cefalofo o duiquero azul Phillantomba maonticola, la rata gigante de Emin Cricetomys emini y el puercoespín africano Atherurus africanus resultaron ser la mayoría de la biomasa animal cazada, consumida o comercializada en ambas aldeas. El duiquero de Ogilby Cephalophus ogilbyi y otros monos fueron cazados solamente por los cazadores comerciales. ´ Estos generaron un promedio de US$2000 al año con las ventas de la carne. Sus familias tuvieron una economía más saneada, mayores ingresos, gastaron más dinero en bienes no esenciales, comprando más productos en vez de cultivarlos. Por el contrario, las familias de los cazadores de subsistencia gastaron menos dinero en bienes de mercado y más en productos esenciales y cultivaron sus propios alimentos. A pesar de estas diferencias, el consumo medio de proteínas vegetales y animales (domésticos y carne de caza) no fue diferente entre ambas aldeas.

However, in many developing countries like Benin, former management strategies kept human from protected areas using coercion. Fortunately, more recent regimes attempt to give local populations more control on the management but little is known about local residents' perceptions, beliefs and attitudes toward the management of these areas. This study, carried out around the Pendjari National Park, determined factors which support local communities' positive perceptions towards biodiversity conservation in the park, analysed their assessment of current park management activities compared to former management approaches and draw the implications for effective participatory management of protected areas. We collected socio-demographic data from 164 residents on their awareness of conservation methods. We used Stepwise Discriminant Analysis to differentiate the variables that had the greatest power for discriminating between local residents' perception to conserve or not biodiversity and to manage the park. The findings indicated that the positive behavior of local communities towards conservation of biodiversity within Pendjari National Park was highly correlated with the current management strategy that involved more effectively local communities, the educational level of participants and their geographical origins. Participants' perceptions of biodiversity conservation were strongly related to locally perceived benefits. Although 89% of participants were favorable to the concept of biodiversity conservation within the park, the decision to ban encroachments due to agricultural activities increased negative opinion on this park management option. Our results suggested that understanding local residents' perceptions and using them as a starting point to improve the park–people relationship could help park management staff to involve more effectively local communities and improve their awareness about biodiversity conservation within the park.","aid":728}

An increasing number of coastal households in tropical countries see their livelihoods endangered by declining fisheries catches. Acceptable livelihood alternatives are needed to reduce the pressure on the marine environment. Indonesian coastal communities do not always depend exclusively on fishing but often diversify their livelihood portfolios, which makes livelihood programs a relevant policy intervention for them. Sea cucumber mariculture is increasingly advocated in Indonesian coastal management. Using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and non-participant observation, current livelihoods and the attitudes toward the possibility of sea cucumber mariculture activities were assessed in two coastal villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Respondents stated a high interest in alternative livelihoods. At the same time, non-economic factors such as tradition and personal gratification played an important role in decisions on whether to fish or not. Villagers' attitudes were influenced by fishery-related experiences, perceptions and understandings, as well as by previous experiences with alternative livelihood programs. The results suggest that it is easier to turn people with farming experience into aquaculturists than people who are highly focused on fishing. Moreover, the indications are that sea cucumber mariculture would remain an additional source of income rather than replace fishing. In the study area, mariculture is still an unfamiliar activity, not yet sufficiently trusted to generate willingness to invest. Villagers' general acceptance of non-fishing income alternatives will need to be promoted if livelihood alternatives are to be successful in reducing pressure on marine resources.","aid":729}

Since the 1960s, when motors were first introduced to Ghana's artisanal canoe fleet, two interrelated processes have occurred in Cape Coast. First, Ghana's fisheries have become increasingly exploited and—in the case of some species—overfished. Second, the social relations of production in the artisanal sector have shifted from being socially embedded to being more market-based and impersonal. I argue that two recent Women in Development (WID) projects in particular have contributed to the breakdown of fishtraders' traditional economic networks and livelihood strategies: (a) loan schemes that target women's associations , and (b) the 1985 Intestate Succession Law, which reconfigured inheritance rights. These WID projects, based on western notions of gender and the household, have created disharmony and mistrust among Cape Coast's fishtraders rather than promoting their \" development. \" The breakdown of fishtraders' labor and marketing organizations has resulted in increasingly desperate strategies to get fish, increased degradation of Ghana's marine environment , and uncertainty for the future of the coastal economy.","aid":1190}

Many cases in different parts of the world indicate that the Indigenous peoples have developed patterns of resource use and management practices that reflect detailed knowledge of local geography and ecosystem, and contribute to the natural conservation through their living practices. The guidelines of Indigenous knowledge and culture lay the base for the development of ecotourism. A critical evaluation of the conceptuali-zation of Indigenous knowledge is therefore, essential to the success of an alternative strategy to development for aboriginal communities. Participatory observation in the field of ecotourism activities and brief interviews are the major study methods, with several workshops conducted to supplement data collection for the two case studies. The Taroko area came into contact with tourists in a relative early era due to its famous natural features and national park. Its growing ecotourism is the result of cooperation among local residents, environmentalists, and academics, each with very different concepts of ecotourism operation. The national park and public sectors have also played significant role in shaping the content of ecotourism. In San-Chan community, due to the negative impacts generated by the unregulated mass tourism expansion, the local Indigenous people decide to close the public access to the attractive creek for 3 years, while at the same time promote ecotourism for poverty alleviation. These two cases embrace the 'Nature' as an important element in their construction of new place identity and community development. However, their spatial location in-or outside the national park produces significant differences and sociopolitical implications on the operations of ecotourism.","aid":750}
