R.","dAbstract":"The attitudes of neighbouring communities towards protected areas are increasingly being considered in the establishment and management of national parks. In South Africa, more inclusive policies have been introduced which seek to involve neighbouring communities in policy formulation and management of Kruger National Park (KNP). This paper examines the attitudes of 38 communities towards KNP along its western border. A random survey of 240 households was conducted to assess attitudes towards the Park, and what factors might influence them. Attitudes were measured by responses to 12 related questions, which were transformed to construct an attitude index. Attitudes are more varied than previously reported. Notwithstanding KNP outreach programmes, many respondents had had no interaction with KNP, 72.9% had never been in the Park, and only 32.1% claimed they knew of KNP's activities. Having a household member employed by KNP, age and de jure Traditional Authority affiliation influenced more positive attitudes toward KNP. Negative attitudes were primarily linked with problems associated with damage-causing animals, including inadequate maintenance of the KNP border fence, poor animal control outside KNP and lack of compensation for affected farmers. These findings on relationships between KNP and its neighbours are relevant for many protected areas in similar contexts elsewhere.","aid":null}

By channelling tourism revenue to local residents, conser-vationists hope to offset wildlife costs and improve local attitudes toward conservation. To date tourism revenue-sharing (TRS) programmes have met mixed success. Local conditions and national policies that shape the success of TRS programmes were identified by comparing the experiences of both implementers and beneficiaries of pilot TRS programmes at three parks in western Uganda. Between 1995 and 1998, communities around these parks used a total of US $83 000 of tourism revenue to build 21 schools, four clinics, one bridge, and one road. In 1996, the Ugandan parliament passed legislation that changed both the amount of money available for TRS and the institutions responsible for sharing the money. The programme was suspended at all three parks while the implementing agency (Uganda Wildlife Authority) struggled to design a programme that complied with the new legislation. TRS funds collected before 1996 were shared through 1998, but since then no revenue has been shared. However, a revised TRS programme is expected to resume in 2001. In semi-structured interviews, both implementers and beneficiaries evaluated local TRS programmes and compared them to other benefit-sharing projects, particularly those promoting sustainable use of non-timber products within park boundaries (n 񮽙 44). Both groups of respondents listed revenue-sharing as the most important advantage of living next to a national park. Seventy-two per cent of respondents indicated that they thought TRS had improved attitudes towards the protected areas, and 53% thought TRS was more important then sustainable use of non-timber forest products. Although respondents were generally positive about TRS, in informal discussions respondents repeatedly mentioned four potential obstacles to TRS success, namely poorly defined TRS policies and unsteady implementing institutions, corruption, inadequate funds, and numerous stakeholders with differing priorities. From this survey and literature from experiences in other African countries, there are four key components of successful revenue-sharing programmes: long-term institutional support, appropriate identification of the target community and project type, transparency and accountability, and adequate funding. With firm institutional support and realistic expectations, TRS can play an important role in improving local attitudes towards conservation.","aid":null}

We assessed attitudes towards three facets of conservation: the tiger, an emblematic species signifying India's commitment to wildlife conservation; the forest, a principle source of fuel-wood and other products; and the Forest Department, which manages the forest. More specifically we predicted that (i) attitudes would be an effective predictor of resource use interest in the forest and (ii) benefits obtained from the EDP would create more favorable attitudes towards conservation and the protected area employees. Twelve villages located within 3 km from the reserve boundary were chosen and 2–3% of the households interviewed with regard to their attitudes towards these three facets of conservation, their household resource use patterns, wealth, sex, age and length of residency. We found significant associations between wealth, sex, age and both tiger and forest conservation. Providing benefits has not changed the underlying attitudes of the communities. The poorer sections of society, whether receiving benefits or not, tended to support tiger conservation because conserving wildlife did not affect their livelihood in any way, whereas both the rich and poor had misgivings about forest conservation due to dependency on forest products. We conclude that the ecodevelopment project has not effectively addressed the most important of the local concerns. q","aid":null}

V. and Armada N. B.","dAbstract":"The lack of general understanding that fisheries is an integral part of a larger and dynamic ecosystem can lead more to highlighting the conflicts, rather than realizing the real interaction between the economic, social, and ecological objectives of fisheries management. Furthermore, the poor grasp for the motivations underlying the fishers' behavior in their response to fisheries issues, policies, and regulations may have contributed to many failed fisheries management endeavors. This paper presents the results of a stated preference survey administered to 422 small-scale fishers in the coastal municipality of Talibon, Bohol of the Danajon Bank, Central Philippines, whereby fisheries management was likened to a commodity or good that satisfies the fishers' needs. The study tested specific attributes representing the economic, social, and ecological objectives of fisheries management that are likely to influence the fishers' attitudes toward a management strategy. The attitudes were elicited from the fishers' preference for a particular hypothetical management scenario over another in a series of choice games. A logistic model demonstrated high probabilities of choice when a management strategy promotes the increase in effort of fishing gear types perceived to be least harmful to the marine ecosystem, increases overall fisheries harvest, secures employment security for the majority, and increases the abundance of blue crabs e an important fisheries commodity in the Danajon Bank area. Key socioeconomic and socio-civic characteristics of the fishers and their general knowledge, attitudes to, and perceptions of fisheries ecology concepts and fisheries management issues were likewise identified as probable determinants of choice and therefore behavior e such as acceptance or support e toward actual fisheries management policies.","aid":null}

Nevertheless, degradation of this ecosystem remains a matter of concern, emphasizing the fact that effective conservation of natural resources is possible only with an understanding of the attitudes and perceptions of local communities. In the present study, we examined the attitudes and perceptions of local communities towards mangrove forests through questionnaire surveys in 36 villages in the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area, India. The sample villages were selected from 336 villages using hierarchical cluster analysis. The study revealed that local communities in the area had positive attitudes towards conservation and that their demographic and socioeconomic conditions influenced people's attitudes. Local communities valued those functions of mangrove forests that were directly linked to their wellbeing. Despite human-wildlife conflict, the attitudes of the local communities were not altogether negative, and they were willing to participate in mangrove restoration. People agreed to adopt alternative resources if access to forest resources were curtailed. Respondents living near the forests, who could not afford alternatives, admitted that they would resort to pilfering. Hence, increasing their livelihood options may reduce the pressure on mangrove forests. In contrast with other ecosystems, the linkages of mangrove ecosystem services with local livelihoods and security are direct and tangible. It is therefore possible to develop strong local support for sustainable management of mangrove forests in areas where a positive attitude towards mangrove conservation prevails. The current debates on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and payment for ecosystem services provide ample scope for development of sustainable livelihood options for local communities from the conservation of critical ecosystems such as mangroves.","aid":null}

C. and Nanaya @. K. and Kushalappa @. C. and Garcia @. C.","dAbstract":"Kodagu district produces 2% of the world's coffee , in complex, multistoried agroforestry systems. The forests of the district harbour a large population of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). The combined effects of high elephant density and major landscape changes due to the expansion of coffee cultivation are the cause of human–ele-phant conflicts (HEC). Mitigation strategies, including electric fences and compensation schemes implemented by the Forest Department have met with limited success. Building on previous studies in the area, we assessed current spatial and temporal trends of conflict, analysed local stakeholders' perceptions and identified factors driving elephants into the estates. Our study, initiated in May 2007, shows that the intensity of HEC has increased over the last 10 years, exhibiting new seasonal patterns. Conflict maps and the lack of correlation between physical features of the coffee plantations and elephant visits suggest elephants move along corridors between the eastern and western forests of the district , opportunistically foraging when crossing the plantations. Dung analyses indicate elephants have selectively included ripe coffee berries in their diet. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of wild elephants feeding on coffee berries. If this new behaviour spreads through the population, it will compound an already severe conflict situation. The behavioural plasticity, the multiplicity of stakeholders involved, the difficulty in defining the problem and the limits of technical solutions already proposed suggest that HEC in Kodagu has the ingredients of a ''wicked'' problem whose resolution will require more shared understanding and problem solving work amongst the stakeholders.","aid":null}

Free-ranging European bison have existed in this area for 40 years, inhabiting a suboptimal habitat characterized by intensive agriculture and fragmented forests. Despite 85.0 % of respondents reporting positive attitudes towards bison presence, 47.4 % of respondents considered the animals acceptable only if they were not closer than 10 km from their residence. Over 60 % of respondents suggested increasing the numbers of bison in the country, and 51 % suggested letting them live freely in the wild. The most negative attitude towards an increase in numbers was shown by women, respondents with lower knowledge of the species and inhabitants of biggest settlements. Public awareness relating to the European bison is lacking, as nearly 50 % of persons residing near areas inhabited by bison did not know about their presence. We conclude that, despite the high valuation placed upon the bison by the public and the ability of the bison to survive in open agrolandscapes with fragmented forests, negative public opinion may be a factor limiting the social carrying capacity for the species. Lithuanian human dimensions of this species should be taken into account when introducing the European bison elsewhere in Western Europe.","aid":null}

Against the backdrop of the increasing popularity of ecotourism and the dramatic loss of tigers due to lack of funding, mismanagement, population and development pressures as well as poaching, this article finds that the present policies benefit neither conservation nor local communities. It is only by integrating ecotourism into a broader array of sustainable livelihoods, will local communities be more inclined to support conservation efforts. T ourism in India's wide network of protected areas (PAs) has a long history, but concerns about its na­ ture are relatively recent. In recent dec­ ades, while the popularity of \" ecotourism \" has skyrocketed, the concept remains poorly understood and much abused, par­ ticularly in India. Scholars of ecotourism have identified at least four principles that must be satisfied for genuine ecotourism: minimisation of environmental impacts, generation of funds for conservation, ben­ efits to local communities, and education of visitors (Honey 1999). However, even a cursory examination of wildlife tourism in PAs of India demonstrates that few of these conditions are met, with the result that such tourism benefits neither conservation nor local communities. Concerns about the shortcomings of such poorly planned wildlife tourism have become all the more u rgent in the light of the tiger conservation d ebacle that has been unfolding in India for the past sever­ al years, a fact noted by the Tiger Task Force Report of 2005 (Narain et al 2005). While the dramatic loss of t igers in recent years may be attributed to a variety of fac­ tors including lack of funding and mis­ management, population and d evelop­ ment pressures as well as poaching, it can be argued that well­planned wildlife tour­ ism would not only increase funding, but by benefiting local communities make them more inclined to support conserva­ tion efforts. This article examines the con­ text of wildlife tourism in PAs of I ndia, points out its shortcomings, and makes recommendations that are likely to benefit the goals of tiger conservation.","aid":null}

These systems reflect the ecological knowledge of the farmers of such risk prone environments. Agroforestry parklands are playing an important role, through trees and shrubs providing soil cover that reduces erosion and buffers the impacts of climate change. They also provide green fodder that complements crop residues for livestock feeds, and fruits and leaves for human consumption and for income generation. The interactions between various components of the system influence the ecosystem service functions of trees of parklands (provisioning, regulating and supporting services) in several ways. These ecosystem functions have been at the center of the local ecological knowledge guiding the management options of the farmers and have also attracted the attention of scientists. Findings revealed new challenges that call for production options ensuring increased and diversified productivity of the systems while preserving the environment. Research on such challenges must adopt an inclusive approach based on local knowledge supported by science-based analyses of the socio-ecological systems in the face of high population pressure and climate change.","aid":null}
{"filename":"Beger et al. 2004","year":2004,"title":"A Framework of Lessons Learned from Community- Based Marine Reserves and Its Effectiveness in Guiding a New Coastal Management Initiative in the Philippines","authors":"Beger M. and Harborne A. R.","dAbstract":"Coral reef management, including fisheries and biodiversity conservation, is often executed using marine protected areas (MPAs), particularly in developing countries (Hatcher and others 1989; Polunin and Roberts 1991McClanahan 1999) and represent \" paper parks \" that are designated but in reality do not achieve their goals. In developing countries, a lack of effectiveness can occur because of limited acceptance and support by adjacent communities that are almost always required for the establishment of a sustainable MPA (Bunce and others 2000; Salm and others 2000; Vanderklift and Ward 2000; White and Vogt 2000). Community support and involvement within an integrated coastal zone management scheme increases the likelihood that, for example, fisherfolk respect reserve regulations (Pomeroy and Carlos 1996; Alcala 1998; Cicin-Sain and Knecht 1998; Russ and Alcala 1999; Olsen and Christie 2000). Fishers who fish illegally or despite voluntary agreements will substantially reduce the efficacy of a reserve and a resumption of fishing quickly decreases fish populations (Davies 1977; Russ and Alcala 1989; Russ and Alcala 1996b). The Philippines is one of the leading proponents of community-based coastal zone management in Southeast Asia (Rivera and Newkirk 1997; Uychiaoco and others 2000) and is often looked to for model approaches (White and Deguit 2000). The archipelago supports extensive coral reef, mangrove, and coastal resources, which are under increasing threat from overexploitation , damage, and pollution (Gomez and others 1994; Bryant and others 1998; Courtney and White 2000). Many coastal communities rely on the sea for income and food, commonly at subsistence level, and, therefore, declining resources combined with population growth lead to increased poverty. The resulting urgent need for resource management has been recognized by many institutions and local communities that have initiated marine resource management projects. In addition to the establishment of marine reserves, such initiatives generally also focus on some of the following objectives: (1) resource assessment and scientific monitoring, (2) community preparation and organizing , (3) capacity building, (4) provision of alternative livelihoods, and (5) conservation education (Rivera and Newkirk 1997; Alcala 1998; Uychiaoco and others 2000). However, many of these projects have proven unsustainable, particularly when external intervention and funding ceases. There are about 565 marine reserves and coastal management schemes in the Philippines , but only 10% have been rated as effective (Aliño and others 2000). A recent case study rating existing MPAs found that 19% of a small number of selected MPAs scored the \" enforced \" or \" sustained \" rating after at least 2 years existence, and only one MPA was rated as \" institutionalized, \" which constitutes the top score (White and others 2003a). Unsuccessful marine reserves can usually be related to a failure to incorporate all necessary components of preparation, implementation, and evaluation in close participation and collaboration with the local community and governmental agencies (Pomeroy and others 1997; Alcala 1998; White and Vogt 2000). The \" lessons learned \" during the establishment of both unsuccessful and successful protected areas have been documented within an extensive body of literature, some of which is unknown in countries aiming to establish marine reserves . The approach of this article is to synthesize and apply existing knowledge to assist the building of a framework for establishing sustainable and effective reef management initiatives. We feel that because a large number of MPAs have been established in the Philippines and the Asia–Pacific region, most of the general principles have been proven and it is now important to understand which are the most successful. Although every proposed protected area will be subject to different conditions, a listing of key factors would be invaluable to managers with limited resources and maximize their chances of success. This article, therefore, has four clear aims: (1) synthesize the previously disparate literature on lessons learned establishing community-based MPAs, principally in the Philippines; (2) describe how the resulting framework of knowledge and experience could be used to guide the establishment of a MPA in the Philippines; (3) provide additional examples of successful practices for establishing marine reserves; (4) highlight the relative importance of different lessons learned in establishing MPA.","aid":null}

Using integrative ecosystem (Savanna) and household (PHEWS) models, we assessed effects of: up to 50,000 ac (20,234 ha) of cultivation; cultivation concentrated into two blocks totaling 10,000 ac (4,047 ha) and 20,000 ac (8,094 ha) that may be more palatable to tourists; and human population growth. Simulations with from 10,000 to 50,000 ac in cultivation showed no large changes in ungulate populations relative to there being no cultivation. When cultivation was altered to be in two blocks, some wildlife populations changed (≤15%) and ungulate biomass remained the same. When cultivation was increased linearly with human population, poor households needed 25% of their diets to come from relief as populations tripled, because livestock could not increase significantly. Our results indicate that having <1% of NCA in cultivation, in its current distribution, is not overly detrimental to wildlife or livestock populations, and is important to Maasai well-being.","aid":null}

The paper's findings are (1) that while the first plan implemented some CM principles (such as sharing responsibility between government, stakeholders and NGOs) it failed to deliver other CM principles (such as transparency and accountability); and (2) that while the second plan increased participation and transparency, and used a more adaptive approach, it still left many stakeholders out of the decision-making process, and its processes of experimentation, monitoring and social learning were very limited. The fact is that CM and ACM are laudable objectives, but very difficult to implement in full.","aid":null}

Since its beginning, the effects and influences of the GGP have been hotly debated among domestic and international scholars and policymakers. This paper is taking the County of Yanchuan in the Loess Plateau as a case study, examines the spatio-temporal patterns of cropland conversion in response to the GGP. This research is methodologically based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS), and also employs personal interviews with local government officials and farmers. The results show that land use/cover patterns in Yanchuan County have changed dramatically after the implementation of GGP. Cropland has decreased remarkably, while orchard land and sparse forest has increased significantly: 23.84% of cropland was converted to orchard, and 22.25% to sparse forest. Simultaneously, the landscape has become more fragmented but also more diversified, forestland has become more dominant. A total of 61.19% of the total converted cropland was on slopes greater than 15 degrees, 64.85% of which was lower-grade land. The converted cropland is mostly located in more accessible areas for convenient management. Partially affected by farmers' self-willingness, sloping cropland was preferred to orchard (economic forest), and some gentle slope (less than 15 degrees) or higher-grade cropland were involved in the GGP. To maintain and reinforce the achievements of the GGP and further contribute to the GGP's sustainability and rural development, the paper recommends that the Chinese government should build a continuous compensation mechanism for the households who lost cropland for the GGP while improving the productivity of flat cropland.

The authors report empirical evidence from 12 case studies from six countries, which are analyzed through the conceptual lens of the Impover-ishment Risks and Reconstruction Model for Involuntary Resettlement. The research concludes conservatively that parks in the Congo basin have already displaced and impoverished about 120–150,000 people and that more will be displaced if this approach continues, despite its deleteri-ous outcomes. The authors argue that the park-establishment strategy predicated upon compulsory population displacement has exhausted its credibility and compromised the cause of biodiversity conservation by inflicting aggravated impoverishment on very large numbers of people. They recommend that the concerned Governments should desist using the eviction approach. The alternative course, proposed by the authors, is to replace forced displacements with a pro-poor strategy that pursues ''double sustainability,'' to protect both the biodiversity and people's livelihoods at the same time.","aid":null}

We illustrate this potential using the case of hornbill conservation in the Budo-Sungai Padi rainforests of southern Thailand, using 16-y hornbill reproduction data and 5-y household expenditures data reflecting local economic well-being. We show that severe windstorms cause both lower household expenditures and critical nest tree losses that directly constrain nesting capacity and so reduce the number of hornbill chicks recruited in the following breeding season. Forest residents' coping strategies further disturb hornbills and their forest habitats, compounding windstorms' adverse effects on hornbills' recruitment in the following year. The strong statistical relationship between wind speed and both hornbill nest tree losses and household expenditures opens up an opportunity to design wind-based index insurance contracts that could both enhance hornbill conservation and support disaster-affected households in the region. We demonstrate how such contracts could be written and operationalized and then use simulations to show the significant promise of unique insurance-based approaches to address weather-related risk that threatens both biodiversity and poor populations. weather risk management | poverty | safety net | sustainable conservation","aid":null}

P.","dAbstract":"Mahseers inhabit the rivers and freshwater lakes of South and Southeast Asian countries. In India, the group is well distributed right from the Himalayas up to the rivers of the Western Ghats. Most of the species belong to the genus Tor. Owing to their excellent sporting quality, the mahseers have been variously called as the 'king', 'lion', 'tiger', 'the great fighter', etc., by the anglers. In certain parts of the country, it has also been even given the status of a 'divine fish'. Due to the similarities in the morphometrics and meristics, difficulties have been encountered in the correct identification of this group of fishes and recently molecular techniques have been used to resolve such ambiguities. To the local fisher folk and the tribal people residing along the up-streams of rivers, mahseers have been of considerable importance as they contribute much to their livelihood as well as food security. Despite their abundance at one time, mahseers are declining rapidly in different parts of India making them a 'threatened' group. Breeding technology has helped in undertaking conservation programmes of the Himalayan mahseer (Tor putitora) and the Deccan mahseer (Tor khudree). Efforts have also been made to understand the nutritional requirements of these species and to culture these species along with other carps. Though the conventional farming of this fish is not promising because of the slow growth compared to the Indian and Chinese carps, however, by formulating practical diets and appropriate technologies there is scope to harness the potential of this group of fishes. The culture of mahseers has to be undertaken with a multifaceted approach considering their value in sport, food and aim at their conservation and scientific management. The involvement of the private sector like Tata Power Company Ltd., in the conservation of the mahseer has shown that long term commitment can bring desirable outputs. The Coorg Wildlife Society is also trying for the management of the group by promoting the 'ecosystem based fish habitat conservation'. These examples clearly demonstrate the involvement of the private and public sectors with the peoples' participation would provide the much needed support to protect this important group of fishes. In this review, an effort is made to assess the progress on various aspects of taxonomy, biology, nutrition, reproduction, aquaculture and conservation of mahseers. The opportunities available to improve the livelihood of people by increasing the research and development efforts on this group of fishes and its tourism potential are also discussed.","aid":null}

COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY-BASED PAYMENT FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROJECTS CBNRM emerged in recent decades as an alternative to centralized, command-and-control environmental management approaches. CBNRM seeks to deliver sustainable natural resource outcomes while enhancing the livelihood opportunities of rural communities. Roe et al. [27] highlight that CBNRM refers to local and collective resource governance arrangements and practices , suggesting that CBNRM models work to 'strengthen locally-accountable institutions for natural resource use and management, enabling local groups of people to make better decisions about the use of land and resources' [27, p. vii] . Control over the natural resource base is devolved to local institutions via the transfer of legal rights, and through empowerment of communities to exercise their rights in local decisionmaking and through formalized links to policy and local development practices [28,29]. The extent to which CBNRM projects achieve resource conservation and development goals, drawing on their own core principles, is variable. Extensively studied CBNRM examples include those seeking to achieve wildlife conservation and poverty alleviation goals, such as the communal areas management programme for indigenous resources (CAMPFIRE). CAMPFIRE involved rural populations across Zimbabwe , supporting their sustainable management of wildlife and other resources [30,31]. Other high profile examples of different 'community conservation' approaches focus on links to eco-tourism or hunting opportunities [32,33], including wildlife management areas in Botswana [34 – 36] and community conservancy schemes in Namibia [37 – 39]. There are numerous critiques of CBNRM in terms of the processes followed and the intended and unintended outcomes [35,40– 42]. Nevertheless, successful and failed examples offer potential to inform project, institutional and partnership development in the rapidly evolving climate finance sector's CB-PES investments [43]. The challenge in learning from such experiences lies in pinpointing the causes of unintended outcomes or implementation challenges and ensuring they are addressed in future project design. All PES projects can be conceptualized as an institution that has been developed for environmental governance, in that they represent a structure that incorporates a range of norms and beliefs that jointly dictate which resources are managed, how, and by whom [44]. PES represents a neoliberal approach to environmental management [45], based on the core principle that payments can directly alter land-use and management practices. This is underpinned by the Coase economic theorem in which externalities are addressed by extending markets through property rights (see [46]), and shapes project structure and execution by requiring involvement of those groups and/or individuals who hold property rights. Holders of property rights are incentivized to provide an ecosystem service through their property in exchange for payment [47,48]. This market-based view of environmental services has been critiqued for oversimplifying complex ecological systems, for inadequately addressing the social and institutional determinants that control land use and management decisionmaking and for being paradoxical by considering that capitalist markets are the answer to their own ecological contradictions49505152 . When a PES project is community-based rather than centred on individual ownership rights, further principles need to be incorporated around community empowerment, capacity building and sound local-level governance [53]. These originate in the wider concept of CBNRM and shape institutional structures because control over natural resources is devolved. This is illustrated by successful CB-PES projects in forest areas, which have involved the establishment of local forest user groups that monitor , regulate and manage resource use and conservation efforts, typically at a village level [10,54,55]. Lessons from forests to rangelands A. J. Dougill et al. 3179 Community-based approaches to resource management , including CB-PES schemes, vary in the extent to which communities are engaged. Often, the degree of community involvement links to the requirements of accreditation standards that projects seek to attain. Voluntary carbon market projects seek verification through a range of accreditation standards [56,57]. Some standards have a strong carbon focus, for example the voluntary carbon standard (VCS), which held a 48 per cent market share of verified credits in 2008 [58]. In contrast, those standards developed by the Plan Vivo Foundation or the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance's Climate, Community and Biodiversity (CCB) place a greater emphasis on the socio-economic and institutional aspects of projects and the delivery of co-benefits beyond carbon storage, requiring more meaningful and extensive community involvement [59,60]. In designing the ways in which communities can be involved in CB-PES schemes, it is important to note that projects and communities are not situated in a power vacuum. Institutional relations between the community and stakeholders at national and international levels (e.g. governments, private sector companies and individual consumers) are diverse, requiring careful consideration of the interplay of factors across micro-to macro-levels. Successful CBNRM projects are mainly located in southern Africa [33,61] and situated in macro-level contexts characterized by low levels of corruption, while legal frameworks allow communities to retain benefits from wildlife [27]. In terms of CB-PES projects, such macro-level considerations include the market mechanisms that shape demand for carbon storage [7], and are not necessarily land-use-specific (e.g. applying to rangelands or forests). Rather, they operate on a national or regional level. While these macro-level aspects provide the broader setting for CB-PES schemes, our analysis focuses on micro-level interactions (at and from the local level) to allow consideration of how lessons from the design of forest CB-PES schemes can inform the development and implementation of CB-PES based around changing land-use and management decisions in rangelands. 3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: LEARNING FROM CB-PES IMPLEMENTATION Studying a project's design, particularly its local-level institutional aspects, is recognized as a useful starting point for explaining successes and failures in community-based initiatives [1,62 – 64]. CB-PES projects based on strong institutional designs can encounter problems owing to clashes with existing local institutional and socio-economic contexts [65]. Conflicts arise from differences between the perspectives of communities around economic functions, and the economic functions that are embodied by projects [66]; the forms and distribution of land rights and roles of communities [67] ; and the distribution of entitlements to benefits arising from projects [68]. Often, existing local-level institutional structures may be insufficient or unable to implement new institutional rules and procedures, and the need to strengthen institutions in order to implement PES projects is widely recognized [1,63,69] . Focus on the implementation challenges encountered by projects structured upon strong CBNRM principles enables identification of the features of the social context that must be considered when implementing CB-PES to deliver multiple benefits. To this end, Dolsak & Ostrom [70] identified eight characteristics of institutional design for a successful CBNRM, being that: In order to examine the micro-level interactions that lead to implementation challenges, we examined the implementation of Plan Vivo CB-PES forest-based projects across sub-Saharan Africa. We looked first at the similarities between Plan Vivo characteristics and the Dolsak and Ostrom criteria to ensure that Plan Vivo projects are well placed in their design to deliver a successful CBNRM and then we assessed their communications and connections to national-and international-level support. Plan Vivo is a standard that draws on core CBNRM principles and places a particular focus on the delivery of socio-economic co-benefits in conjunction with carbon storage [71]. The principal criterion for participating in a Plan Vivo project is clear ownership/tenancy/recognized user rights of land, whether as an individual or formal user group. Projects are coordinated by a project coordinating body (PCB) that works closely with local government authorities to support project objectives . The PCB is responsible for: marketing Plan Vivo certificates; handling policy matters; database management ; coordinating project activities; and annual reporting to the Plan Vivo Foundation. The PCB typically has a team of field staff responsible for training and capacity building, community engagement and leading carbon-monitoring activities. Plan Vivo Foundation staff are involved in the verification of annual reports, whereas projects are validated by third parties who are approved by Plan Vivo according to clear guidelines. Carbon accounting periods are calculated between 25 and 100 years, and usually front-loaded, being paid to participants during the first 10 years of accreditation. This compensates for the costs of altering land-management practices and provides money prior to the delivery of additional economic benefits from trees, such as from fruit harvests, non-timber forest products and/or increased crop yields owing to improved soil fertility [72]. The ways in which Plan Vivo meets Dolsak and Ostrom's characteristics for successful CBNRM are summarized in table 1.Table 2 details the four existing and four planned CB-PES projects across Africa certified under the Plan Vivo Standard (as of early 2012). Three of the existing projects were selected for more detailed analysis, as well-developed examples of operational CB-PES projects (figure 1). Three projects were chosen owing to the depth of available information about their institutional characteristics and on the basis of their achievement of Plan Vivo certification. The projects are in Malawi (Trees) were analysed (full reports available at www. planvivo.org/projects/). We noted instances where implementation and project design challenges were identified and where planned procedures had been changed or adapted. Challenges outlined in each project were grouped according to their similarity in emphasis to enable comparisons across the three projects ( §4a). We then situated the findings within the wider literature on these forest projects ( §4b) in order to understand the role of institutional interactions in creating these challenges and how they relate to a failure to fulfil Dolsak and Ostrom's design characteristics for successful resource management. Finally, we contextualized the implementation challenges identified as important considerations emerging from rangeland CBNRM projects ( §4c). This allowed us to draw out the key institutional aspects from the analysis that can inform the development of future rangeland CB-PES projects.","aid":null}
{"filename":"Duchelle et al. 2011","year":2011,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Local communities may help determine tropical forest fates. Communities now own or manage onequarter of the world's tropical forests due to recent devolution of government-owned lands and formal recognition of customary rights (White and Martin 2002, Sunderlin et al. 2008). Such transfers of forest ownership and management rights to local control have the potential to promote both conservation and livelihood development in remote tropical regions (Sunderlin et al. 2005), where rural people often depend on forest resources for their economic wellbeing (Belcher et al. 2005). Devolution of property rights to community control, however, does not always promote forest conservation (Brown and Rosendo 2000, Gould 2006, Tacconi 2007a), but forest-dependent communities with secure rights may place greater emphasis on long-term forest management (McKean 2000, Colfer 2005, Sayer et al. 2008). Such shifts in property rights, however, can generate forest-based conflicts, particularly when combined with rapidly increasing values of forest resources (de Jong et al. 2006). Also, rising resource prices may increase demand for property rights security (Demsetz 1967), and costs of enforcing those increasingly valuable rights may become prohibitive (Fitzpatrick 2006). Legitimate users may be excluded while others gain control (Dick and Mwangi 2008). Furthermore, as property rights shift and conflicts arise, the ability to enforce formal and informal rules that dictate resource use, long considered the basis of successful community-based resource management (Ostrom 1990, Agrawal 2001), may be jeopardized. A simple, yet common manifestation of emergent forest-based conflicts is theft of forest resources, especially when demand for forest products is high and local access and exclusion rights are weakened (Koning et al. 2007). Illegal logging is a clear example of forest resource theft, and some of its primary causes are weak state governance, unclear property rights, and strong economic incentives for illegality (Tacconi 2007b). In ill-defined property regimes in the developing tropical world, resource theft could be either real or perceived. In real resource theft, criminals take advantage of tenure insecurity to take another person's property without their consent. In perceived resource theft, contradictory policies and confusion over the changing property rights systems create a situation where different actors feel entitled to the same resources. For instance, in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon, violent conflicts between landowners and squatters ensued when incompatible legal rights were granted to each of these groups on lands that were rapidly increasing in value ( Wood 1992, Alston et al. 2000). In this insecure context, timber thieves took advantage of the insecure tenure situation to pilfer valuable logs (Blate et al. 2002, Ros-Tonen et al. 2008). In northern Bolivia, overlapping land titles were granted to communities, timber concessions, and private estates, which resulted in conflicts, including perceived theft of high-value forest resources (Ruiz 2005). These and other examples of forest-based conflicts suggest that much caution is needed during the increasingly common process of formalizing communities' often complex customary rights to land and resources. Communities manage natural resources both as common-pool and private assets (Ostrom 2003), with rights governed by local institutions often adapting over time (Gibson et al. 2000). Such complex property rights can be perceived as \" webs of interest \" made up of overriding, overlapping, complementary, or contested interests between multiple actors. Formalizing communal tenure may be akin to \" cutting the web \" (Meinzen-Dick and Mwangi 2008) if customary rules are overturned, and can result in unsustainable resource use if community members are unsure which rules apply (Fitzpatrick 2006). Furthermore, granting titles to land often ignores traditional tree tenure systems common in tropical forests (Fortmann and Bruce 1988), resulting in discrepancies between formal and customary rights. These arguments are not meant to diminish the importance of land titling, communal or otherwise, but rather highlight the need to not only address conflictive external claims to land and resources but also to recognize internal differences within communities (Agrawal and Gibson 1999) in the titling process, and to be alert to potential conflicts as they arise. We explored the linkages between forest-based conflicts and property rights shifts through comparative research on the phenomenon of Brazil nut theft in neighboring Pando, Bolivia and Acre, Brazil in Western Amazonia. In this context, we define theft as the victim's perceived removal of their Brazil nuts without consent, independent of whether or not the perpetrator actually committed a wrongful act. Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is the most important non-timber forest product (NTFP) in this region, and while individual trees are considered key livelihood assets by forest dwellers in both countries, thefts of Brazil nuts in Bolivia had escalated and even generated violent responses at the onset of our study (El Deber 2005). We focus our comparison on these two adjacent areas because while they share a similar natural resource base and both have undergone recent property rights shifts to community control, there are marked differences in national forest policies and dependence on Brazil nuts by local communities. In this paper, we describe this contextual backdrop, and then present results of field studies on rural livelihoods and reported Brazil nuts thefts, and explore the causes of such thefts, along with their management implications. Specifically, we ask (1) To what extent do Brazil nut thefts occur in forest-dwelling communities in Pando and Acre? (2) What is the impact of these thefts on rural livelihoods? (3) Under what circumstances are thefts more likely to occur? and (4) How does threat of theft affect Brazil nut harvest and management? This comparative study addresses broader issues related to the role of property rights security and resource conflicts, livelihoods, and tropical forest management and conservation by rural communities.","aid":null}

In many places in the world, farmer participation has been shown to be essential in the planning of sustainable land management. The findings of a participatory approach (PA) for integrated conservation planning in the Danangou catchment—a small catchment situated in the heart of Loess Plateau—are presented in this paper. The work was carried out by an interdisciplinary team during the period 1997 – 2000. The PA is an interactive learning process between local farmers and researchers. The process was facilitated by several visualisation and diagramming methods. This formed part of an integrated conservation planning approach, where three tools including PA, land evaluation and soil erosion modelling were combined within the entire conservation planning process. The Danangou catchment is characterised by its distribution of cropping systems on all degrees of slope to meet the food needs of the villagers. Farmers' criteria on land suitability, including slope aspect and soil workability, were evaluated. Farmers approved several biological and physical conservative measures, which provided one of the important bases for formulating different land use scenarios (LU scenarios). The factors influencing farmers in choosing different LU scenarios were analysed, including (1) current household economy in relation to production from the land; and (2) prediction of changes in the household economy due to different LU scenarios. (M.H. Hoang Fagerström). www.elsevier.com/locate/catena Catena 54 (2003) 271 – 288 The farmers' vision on implementation of the LU scenarios, i.e. gradually converting cropping land, conforms well with the plans of the local government. However, due to the poor living standard and lack of off-farm employment, any effort to improve land use towards more sustainable practices seemed to be difficult to implement without support from the government in terms of food, seedlings and also sources of employment for the villagers. The strategy for conversion work in connection with the central government policy on re-greening the Loess Plateau must focus first on areas where off-farm activities are available or potentially available. A diversity of conservation alternatives was found to meet the needs of different farmers' groups. It is recommended that alternatives be developed by an active collaboration between farmers, extensionists and researchers. D","aid":null}

F. and Alli","dAbstract":"Mangroves are putatively vulnerable to climate change, especially sea level rise, depending on factors such as coastal topography and the presence of barriers to landward migration. Usage patterns of mangrove resources can also affect their ability to respond to change. Brazilian artisanal fisherfolk are highly dependent on mangrove resources and services, which makes them also vulnerable to climate change. These populations have to cope with high levels of uncertainty related to the availability of natural resources, and to social and political contexts, such as biodiversity conservation policies. Besides being protected by many different laws, mangroves are also included in no-take protected areas. This may contribute to their resilience as natural systems, but can enhance the vulnerability of human populations. We propose herein a research methodology for assessing the vulnerability to climate change of the social-ecological system mangroves-fisherfolk, by analyzing exposure to sea-level rise, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, and the impacts of conservation policies on these elements, particularly the effects of coastal protected areas in southern Brazil. An integrated social-ecological diagnosis may lead to more flexible policies, elaborated with stakeholders' participation, more adequate to local realities and more inclusive of strategies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

Pescadores artesanais no Brasil são dependentes de recursos e serviços ambientais dos manguezais, sendo também vulneráveis às mudanças climáticas. Eles lidam com incertezas relacionadas à disponibilidade destes recursos, e a contextos sociais e políticos.

With the use of socioeconomic surveys, from February to July 2006, we established that the amount of the annual fuel-wood harvest for five study sites was about 102,650 m 3 (i.e., an amount equivalent to clearing about 205.3 ha of mangrove forests annually). It is estimated that approximately 62% of this total is used to smoke most of the fish (i.e., about 90.7% of the fish landings) across the five study sites. The quantities of wood seemed to vary proportionately with fish landings across sites, hence indicating a probable direct correlation between mangrove wood harvested and its use in fish smoking. The different uses of mangrove wood were similar in all sites, but the quantities of wood extracted from different sites varied, with sites of high fish landings registering the highest fuel-wood turnover. It seemed that local people were unaware of the need to maintain ecosystem functions despite the close relationship between wood and fish harvesting, and their importance in ensuring the livelihood for local population in the study areas. From the revision of current management policies and field observations, we propose the development of adaptive management strategies aimed at improving policy, creating public awareness, and integrating local communities in the development of a sustainable management plan for the mangrove resources of Cameroon.","aid":null}

We assessed differences in the attitudes of participating artisanal fishers toward this form of management to understand their importance in the design and implementation of fisheries management. We used questionnaires and participatory rural appraisal techniques to survey members of six fishing management committees. Fishers' attitudes varied significantly among syndicates in three main domains: attitudes toward the environment, unresolved aspects behind the management area policy, and perceived benefits derived from adoption of the policy. These differences indicated the existence of distinct world views that structure fishers' behavior toward the marine environment and its management. In addition, the responses made by fishers correlated best with the degree of off-sector pluriactivity and their dependence on diving as a source of income. This suggested that a livelihood approach to the development of Chilean artisanal fisheries that considers the multiple economic niches of the fishers will be most effective in the implementation of dual conservation/management measures.

L. and Boucher T. and Kroeger T. and Benitez S. and Calvache A.","dAbstract":"Payments for ecosystem services (PES) are emerging worldwide as important mechanisms to align investments in human and natural well-being. PES projects are often defined as voluntary transactions where well-defined environmental/ecosystem services (or land uses likely to secure those services) are bought by a minimum of one service buyer, from a minimum of one service provider, if and only if the service provider continuously secures service provision (conditionality). Further criteria of PES include limiting additional objectives and ensuring that payments reward behaviour that would otherwise not occur (addi-tionality). Together these best practices for PES are increasingly accepted as the most efficient means to achieve desired outcomes and are guiding funding for PES projects. We used a series of water funds (watershed-oriented PES projects based on a trust fund model) to examine how theoretical best practices could inform and improve practice and also how theory could learn from practical efforts. We conclude that thoughtful consideration is required when evaluating the promise of a PES approach against a theoretical ideal. We found that requiring conditionality may limit the use of creative finance mechanisms such as trust funds that can provide long-term benefits for conservation and human well-being, and that requiring additionality can exclude benefits from social diffusion and result in the inefficient targeting of PES funds. Finally, public–private partnerships in water funds lead to multiple additional/side objectives but partnerships are likely to lower transaction costs and provide transparent, long-term landscape-scale watershed management.","aid":null}

G. and Peroni N.","dAbstract":"1 Introduction Coastal people worldwide face a constant dilemma between economic development and pressures towards resource conservation. While the increasing process of resource depletion leads to conservation-oriented policies, the demand for regional development fosters the development of infrastructure, and increases the pressure over the ecosystems. Such exogenous processes influence the way how local populations make decisions towards resource use. However, other important constraints influence resource use decisions, such as the local processes of social organization, household structure and resource availability. The Brazilian Atlantic forest comprises currently less than 10% of its original vegetation along the coast, between the latitudes 14° S and 21° S. The threat of habitat reduction over the remaining original forest, combined with its high biodiversity, tops this biome as a hot spot for natural resource conservation (MYERS et al., 2000). On the other hand, the increasing demand for infrastructure development on the coast creates a counter-pressure to conservation through urbanization and tourism business.

In this paper, we synthesize lessons from two comparative case studies of decentralized forest management in Mesoamerica and East Africa in order to examine the institutional factors that contribute to successful tropical forest management in developing countries and, draw insights for policymakers regarding how national policy initiatives, including REDD+, might better embed local level institutions for forest management within broader state institutions and promote more positive local livelihoods and forest conservation outcomes. The case studies presented in this synthesis used a consistent research framework to gather data on forestry reforms, governance processes, local forest institutions, household forest uses and forest conservation outcomes. Our synthesis suggests that successful sustained forest management depends on institutional arrangements that (1) establish local resident rulemaking autonomy, (2) facilitate the flow of external financial and institutional assistance for monitoring and enforcement of local rules, and (3) buffer residents and their respective local institutions from more powerful, and at times corrupt, actors and agencies involved in forest exploitation. The results particularly suggest a role for external, independent non-governmental organizations to help mediate demands on local forest governance systems in nested contexts.","aid":null}

Conservation of the critically endangered saiga antelope in the Republic of Kalmykia (Russia) provides a unique experimental setup that was used to disentangle this issue. This study uses the amount pledged for conservation, adapted from contingent valuation methods, as a measure of behavioural intention to contribute to saiga conservation, to evaluate conservation effectiveness. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 250 individuals in eight villages exposed to traditional 'fences-and-fines' conservation, livelihoods enhancement (social engagement) or low-level media coverage. The intervention employed had a direct effect on amount pledged for saiga conservation. Social engagement programmes decreased protest-bidding behaviour but resulted in low amounts pledged for saiga conservation. Those exposed to media coverage pledged the greatest amounts on average, whilst those exposed to traditional conservation had both a high level of protest bidding and low pledges from those who pledged something. The primary reason given for protest bids was that the government or international community should pay for conservation. This may be a relic from the Soviet era, and may explain low pledges for conservation under social engagement. Ecological knowledge strongly affected amount pledged. The results were influenced by cultural and demographic factors, including residence time, exposure to saigas, age, wealth and knowledge regarding conservation. This study is unusual in disentangling the effect of a conservation intervention from other factors, and proposes using amount pledged for conservation as a practical tool for evaluating the effectiveness of projects aimed at increasing awareness and promoting positive behavioural intentions towards conservation.","aid":null}

{"filename":"Jackobsen 2006","year":2006,"title":"","authors":"","dAbstract":"Non-Timber Forest Products NTFPs are important to the livelihoods of people in the remote uplands of Vietnam (Sunderlin & Huynh Thu Ba, 2005 ). It is estimated that 24 million people out of a population of 82 million inhabitants either live near forests or are dependent on forests, and nearly eight million ethnic minority people spend much of their time gathering NTFPs and hunting (Poffenberger et al., 1998 ). The products have been harvested by shifting cultivators for subsistence use and trade for centuries (Scherr et al., 2003; Sunderlin et al., 2003). In addition, NTFPs have attracted considerable attention over the last couple of decades in relation to rural development, poverty alleviation, and sustainable conservation of natural resources in third world countries. The idea that forests can produce a flow of valuable products without causing the destruction often associated with industrial forestry has proven attractive to environmental NGOs, donors and development agencies (Belcher & Kusters, 2004). Widespread research in Mainland Southeast Asia has documented the role and importance of NTFPs as safety nets and buffers in relation to food supply and income during times of change and insecurity (Belcher & Kusters, 2004). The diverse and heterogeneous patterns of land use and land cover in shifting cultivation systems compared to more homogeneous permanent agricultural systems ensure that households are provided with several different resources and benefits throughout the year. Fallow areas and secondary forests in various successional stages contribute resources such as food products, medicinal plants, timber, fuel wood, livestock fodder, and provide environmental services such as erosion control, soil fertility replenishment , improved nutrient and hydrological cycles, boundary delineation, watershed stability, biodiversity and carbon sequestration ( Meyers, 1988; Perz & Walker, 2002; Sanchez, 1999; Sunderlin & Huynh, Thu Ba 2005). Yet, this study focuses on the NTFPs extracted from forests and fallows and the role they play in the livelihood strategy of upland shifting cultivation farmers during a land use intensification process. The environmental services provided by forests and fallows are beyond the scope of this study. Forest foods seldom provide the bulk, staple items that people eat. For the majority of rural people, forest foods add variety to diets, improve palatability, and provide essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins. The quantities consumed may not be great in comparison to the main food staples, but they often form an essential part of people's diets. Consequently, forest foods are most extensively used to help meet dietary shortfalls during particular seasons in the year. NTFPs are also valued during the peak agricultural labour period, when less time is available for cooking and people consume more snack foods. The importance of forest foods and incomes thus often lies more in its timing than in its magnitude as a share of total inputs. Part of the comparative advantage of NTFPs is therefore that they increase the seasonal flexibility of rural livelihoods. According to Byron & Arnold (1997), users of NTFPs can crudely be divided into those who choose to generate much of their livelihood from forests because it is an attractive , viable option, to those for whom forest dependency is a livelihood of last resort, which they will abandon as soon as any alternative option emerges. Wealthier farmers have greater access to labour and capital, and are often in a better position to exploit new or expanded market opportunities for forest products as they arise. Poor farmers on the other hand, with small farms or declining productivity , will tend to increase their reliance as they reduce their food self-sufficiency. It is therefore important to distinguish between those users who have no alternative ways of generating income, and those users who can choose between using NTFP and adequate alternatives (Arnold & Pérez, 2001). Unequal access to opportunities in relation to agricultural resources causes households to follow different livelihood strategies and also different strategies regarding the management of NTFPs. Recent research investigating the role of NTFPs in household strategies has come up with three different strategies describing how NTFPs contribute to the household economy. Belcher & Kusters (2004) have analysed wide-ranging data and hence suggest three household strategies in relation to the management of NTFPs. Their research is based on an extensive investigation of NTFPs in 61 different locations in Asia (21 cases), Africa (17 cases) and Latin America (23 cases) using a standardised set of variables. The three household strategies found are categorized as coping, supplementing, or specialized, seeTable 1. In general, subsistence use of NTFPs continues to be very large, even where people are becoming increasingly integrated into the market economy. The buffer role of the forest, as a safety net or as a food and fodder source that enables people to survive periods of agricultural shortfalls , continues to be very important for many shifting cultivators (Byron & Arnold, 1997). Yet, the forest fulfils the role of a buffer not just during years of crop failure, but in normal years, too. Moreover, it fills this function for most -often all -villagers. The forest, in these terms, is just not a resource for the very poorest in times of hardship, but for a major part of upland communities and populations throughout the year (Rigg, 2006)","aid":null}

Tracing the evolving relationship between ecotourism and conservation, ecotourism and sustainable tourism, and ecotourism and certification/monitoring schemes as we do in this paper reveals conflicting values and possibly incompatible objectives. Sustainable tourism and ecotourism are rooted in notions of individual/ societal and environmental well-being. Yet, our study indicates significant inequities in ecotourism practice, particularly with respect to cultural aspects such as human ecological relationships. It is argued here that various actions and programmes associated with ecotourism's inception and evolution have institutionalised a mod-ernistic, commodified paradigm: the environment and its inhabitants (human and non-human) are dominated by scientific, industry and other interests that treat these primarily as means to an end, that is, instrumentally. The analysis suggests that ecotourism (and, by extension, ecotourism certification) needs to be reoriented towards well-being, in other words, a social-cultural paradigm based on participatory democracy and equitable, meaningful relationships with the biophysical world. Suggestions are forwarded for re-envisioning ecotourism, particularly with respect to the notions of cultural equity, participatory practice and researcher praxis.","aid":null}

Enormous work has been done on ethnobotany and traditional medicine. Like plants, animal and their products are also possessing medicinal properties that can be exploited for the benefit of human beings. In India, many ethnic communities are dispersed all over the country and these people are still totally depended on local traditional medicinal system for their health care. India is gifted with faunal and floral biodiversity, Mount Abu wildlife sanctuary is also one of them, and thus the aim of this work was to take an ethnozoological field survey among Garasiya people (main tribal group of this area) in the adjoining areas of this sanctuary. Method: In order to document the ethnozoological information about animal and their products prevalent among these people in the adjoining area of Mount Abu wildlife sanctuary, a study was carried out from January, 2008 to April, 2008. Data were collected through semi-structured questionnaire and open interview with 25 (16 male and 9 female) selected Garasiya people. The name of animal and other ethnozoological information were documented. Photographs and discussion were also recorded with the help of camera and voice recorder. Result: A total of 24 animal species were used in 35 different medicinal purposes including asthma, weakness, tuberculosis, cough, paralysis and blister and for other religious purposes. It has been find out that animal used by Garasiya, consist of fourteen mammals, five birds, three reptiles, one arthropods and one amphibian. The meat of Cynopterus sphinx used to relieved fever and cough has the highest FL (96%) although flesh of Sus scrofa and tooth of Elephas maximus have the lowest FL (12%). Some protected species such as Elephas maximus (elephant), Semnopithecus priam (monkey), Cervus unicolor (sambhar) were also mentioned as important medicinal resources. We also found that cough, asthma and other respiratory diseases are the most frequently cited disease, as such, a number of traditional medicine are available for the treatment.","aid":null}

Rural residents constitute most of the region's poor, and they rely heavily on natural resources for their subsistence (FAO 2011 p 90, IFAD 2011, Shackleton et al. 2008, Sunderlin et al. 2008). Forests and trees provide millions of informal jobs and affordable necessities for the region's inhabitants and are therefore central for subsistence (FAO 2012a, Vedeld et al. 2007). However, this source of income is threatened by the rapid deforestation of 3.4 million ha per year in eastern and southern Africa (FAO 2012b)—degradation that will impact the weakest groups the hardest. In addition to rapid deforestation, the forest sector in eastern and southern Africa faces new challenges and opportunities as economic growth, population increase and urbanisation drive an increasing regional need for forest products (IMF 2011), creating supply chains for construction purposes, tools, furniture, energy and industrial roundwood. National forest development policies that aim to halt deforestation and foster sustainable forest use, such as development projects, regulations and rural information campaigns, have shifted over time from frequently unsuccessful top-down approaches to community-based forest management (CBFM) approaches that recognise the competence and priorities of local people (Arnold 1992, Odera 2004). This shift has occurred because the effectiveness of forest management activities depends on local knowledge, needs and institutions (Berkes et al. 1989, Ostrom 1990). Community-based forest groups (CBFGs) are institutionalised and recognised community organisations practising CBFM. Several studies have demonstrated the need for CBFM arrangements to ensure equitable benefit sharing and sustainable development (Forsyth et al. 1998, German et al. 2010, Shiferaw 2006). CBFGs have become more common in the region, driven by decentralisation policies, an emerging enabling policy environment for CBFM, local needs and inspiration from successful CBFGs (FAO 2011, Odera 2004). Potential schemes include the formation of local small and medium enterprises (SME) working in partnership with external investors (Elson 2012), such as Investment in Locally Controlled Forest (ILCF). The ILCF-framework helps improve the match between the goals of the investors and SMEs by distinguishing between enabling and asset investments. Enabling investments prepare the ground for NGOs, philanthropists or government to facilitate commercial success with no expectation of direct financial reward. Conversely, asset investments seek a tangible return on the investment, usually in the form of profit or products (Elson 2012). Countries in eastern and southern Africa have adopted national policies that allow for community forestry and the establishment of CBFGs (CIFOR 2008, Molnar et al. 2007). In Tanzania, CBFM is reflected in the Forest Act and the formation of Village Land Forest Reserves (VLFRs). Kenya recognises the role of smallholders in forest management and requires communities to be organised to receive user rights. In METHODS","aid":null}

B.","dAbstract":"Conceptual framework Biodiversity as the foundation for healthy diets and livelihoods Traditional farming and hunter–gatherer societies typically draw on a defined suite of resources within a local environment in a manner that is both self-sufficient and nutritionally balanced. A range of cereals, roots and tubers, legumes, other seeds, fruits, vegetables and animal-source foods are the source of essential energy, lipids, protein, vitamins and minerals. Individual crops, many of which are locally important but neglected and underutilized globally, vary in their nutritional and health properties (Johns & Sthapit, 2004). The elimination of most essential nutrient deficiencies requires only small increases in the variety of food items an individual consumes (Ruel, 2003). Nonetheless, many underutilized species are rich in nutrient quality. For example, millets, which are important in traditional diets in both south Asia and Sahelian Africa are a good source of dietary Fe (Antony & Chandra, 1998; Lestienne, 2005). It has been observed (Spigelski, 2004 ) that reduced consumption of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) couscous in Senegal in favour of less-expensive imported rice leads to reduced Fe intake in a population that already suffers high rates of Fe-deficiency anaemia. Buriti (Mauritia flexuosa L.) and some other palm fruits from Brazil are excellent sources of b-carotene (Rodriquez-Amaya, 1999). Among leafy vegetables Moringa oleifera offers an example of a fast-growing multi-purpose tree, the leaves of which contain exceptional nutrient quality in vitamins A and C, Ca, Fe and protein (Gidamis et al. 2004). It has been promoted successfully to reduce malnutrition in several sub-Saharan African countries. Although concern for the functional properties of foods that prevent chronic disease has emerged primarily in relation to the health of populations in industrial societies, many insights on the benefits of dietary constituents, such as n-3 fatty acids from marine sources, fibre and antioxidants , derive from studies of traditional diets (Johns & Sthapit, 2004). A diversity of fruits, vegetables and other plant foods generally contributes to lower rates of morbidity and mortality, and particular foods reduce risk of specific diseases (Tucker, 2001). Important functional examples among underutilized crops include buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench; Li & Zhang, 2001) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.; Kurup & Krishnamurthy, 1993), foods that reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. In addition, they have blood glucoselowering effects attributable to soluble-and insoluble-fibre components. The benefits of antioxidant phenolics, or carotenoids such as lycopene and lutein, may exceed those attributable to b-carotene or other nutrients. Evidence suggests that lycopene from tomatoes and various fruits prevents prostate cancer in men and possibly other conditions (Hasler, 2002). Lutein, which is high in most green leafy vegetables and mostly absent from other foods, and zeaxanthin, which occurs in large amounts in yellow maize, appear to be important for preventing cataracts, the leading cause of blindness worldwide, and other forms of age-related eye disease (Mares-Perlman et al. 2002). In addition to providing basic subsistence, cultivated and wild-gathered biodiversity is an important source of income generation for small-scale farmers around the world. Poverty reduction as it increases options for purchasing food and diversifying diet is critical to overcoming malnutrition and improving health.","aid":null}

Any attempts to mitigate human–leopard conflict and conserve the species in conflict should be based on an unequivocal understanding of the conflict patterns. A household survey was conducted with an intention to quantify livestock losses resulting from depredation by leopards in and around the Machiara National Park, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. A total of 301 livestock were killed between June 2007 and August 2008 by leopards. The extent of loss varied in different months, with maximum killing occurring in the month of May. Small-bodied livestock such as goats and sheep were more vulnerable than large-bodied cattle. Goats were killed in significantly higher numbers as compared to other livestock. Domestic animals were killed more frequently at night as compared to other times of the day. There was a significant effect of the nighttime protection measures on depredation. Most attacks happened in valleys and in areas far from the forests. Factors most closely associated with livestock depredation included decline of natural prey, herding practices, guarding especially during the night-time, and repeated use of pastures where predators were known to be hunting actively. Attitudes of the local community towards leopards were largely negative, and further efforts should be made to improve support for carnivore conservation.

Overexploited fisheries upset the balance between local economic needs and endangered species' conservation. We investigated resource competition between fisheries and Ganges river dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) in a human-dominated river system in India to assess the potential for their coexistence. We surveyed a 65-km stretch of the lower Ganga River to assess habitat use by dolphins (encounter rates) and fishing activity (habitat preferences of fishers, intensity of net and boat use). Dolphin abundance in the main channel increased from 179 (SE 7) (mid dry season) to 270 (SE 8) (peak dry season), probably as a result of immigration from upstream tributaries. Dolphins preferred river channels with muddy, rocky substrates, and deep midchannel waters. These areas overlapped considerably with fishing areas. Sites with 2–6 boats/km (moderately fished) were more preferred by dolphins than sites with 8–55 boats/km (heavily fished). Estimated spatial (85%) and prey–resource overlap (75%) between fisheries and dolphins (chiefly predators of small fish) suggests a high level of competition between the two groups. A decrease in abundance of larger fish, indicated by the fact that small fish comprised 74% of the total caught, may have intensified the present competition. Dolphins seem resilient to changes in fish community structure and may persist in over-fished rivers. Regulated fishing in dolphin hotspots and maintenance of adequate dry season flows can sustain dolphins in tributaries and reduce competition in the main river. Fish-stock restoration and management, effective monitoring, curbing destructive fishing practices, secure tenure rights, and provision of alternative livelihoods for fishers may help reconcile conservation and local needs in overexploited river systems. Coexistencia de Pesquerías con la Conservación de Delfines Resumen: La conservación de la biodiversidad dulceacuícola generalmente es percibida como un conflicto entre el uso por humanos y la extracción (e.g., pesquerías). Las pesquerías sobreexplotadas alteran el equilibrio entre las necesidades económicas locales y la conservación de especies en peligro. Investigamos la competencia de recursos entre pesquerías y delfines del Río Ganges (Platanista gangetica gangetica) en un sistema fluvial dominado por humanos para evaluar el potencial para su coexistencia. Muestreamos un tramo de 65 km de la cuenca baja del Río Ganga para evaluar el uso de hábitat por delfines (tasas de encuentro) y la actividad pesquera (preferencias de hábitat de pescadores, intensidad de uso de redes y lanchas). La abundancia de delfines en el canal principal incrementó de 179 (ES 7) (mediados de la estación de sequía) a 280 (ES8) (pico 1131 de la estación de sequía), probablemente como un resultado de la inmigración desde afluentes río arriba.

The study on utilization of medicinal plants for meeting heath care needs was carried out between March 2001 and March 2002 in New Dabaga Ulongambi Forest Reserve, Tanzania. The study aimed at generating necessary data for the Udzungwa Mountains Forest Management project to draft sound Joint Forest Management plans. Specific objectives of the study among others were to assess knowledge associated with utilization of medicinal plants for health care needs as well as factors associated in using plant medicines in the study area. A questionnaire survey, market survey and literature review were used to collect information. Tools used for data analysis were Statistical Packages for Social Science and content analysis. A total of 45 plant species were documented curing about 22 human diseases. Medicinal plants were readily available throughout the year and plentiful in the forest reserve. Roots and leaves were the plant parts harvested for medicinal purposes. Processing of plant medicines involved boiling, pounding, soaking in water and chewing. Distance to health facility, income level of the household and beliefs contributed to the use of plant medicines. The study concluded that medicinal plants play an important role in providing primary health care to the rural communities. It is recommended that in achieving joint forest management (JFM), villagers adjacent to the forest reserve should be sensitised on the importance of JFM through seminars, workshops, drama, school songs or video show. During the development of a joint draft management plan, villagers as an informal institution must define their priority needs of use of parts of the forest in collaboration with the Udzungwa Mountains Forest Management project.","aid":null}

M. and Kiyingi I. and Bukenya M.","dAbstract":"The different interests in forest resources by various stakeholders may result in differences in perceived value of forest conservation. In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the valuation by international ecotourists and local respondents of the perceived benefits of the Mabira Central Forest Reserve. The factors that influenced respondents' valuation of forest conservation were also investigated. Describing a hypothetical scenario to elicit respondents' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for forest conservation was the central part of the questionnaire. The WTP;income ratio was used to estimate respondents' perceived value of forest conservation. A chi-square (χ 2) test indicated significant association between respondent category (local and tourist) and categories of perceived benefits (p-value = 0.001). The locals were more interested in direct-use values while the tourists showed greater interest in the indirect-use values. A Student's t-test showed that the WTP:income ratios of the locals were much higher than for the ecotourists (p-value < 0.001). This implies that the local communities had a higher valuation of forest conservation than the ecotourists. Regression analysis revealed that all other factors being constant, the WTP of respondents who perceived direct-and indirect-use value as the most important forest benefit was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those who perceived no value by $5.8693 and $0.02628, respectively. The respondents who rated the contribution of the ecotourism project to community development as moderate had a significantly higher WTP compared to those who rated it as low by $6.6908. Overall, these results indicate that the benefits people derive from the forest either through direct or indirect uses influence valuation of forest conservation. Results also indicate that although ecotourism-related benefits improved attitudes towards forest conservation, ecotourism alone may not be an adequate conservation tool because of the limited support it can provide to the local community.","aid":null}

Based on the assessed ecological conditions (Condition Index, CI; Coral Coverage Index, CCI; Reef Condition Index, RCI; Fish Biomass) and derived ranking, suitable small-scale alternative livelihoods (aquaculture or land-based) to be implemented nearby these reserves were discussed and developed with the involvement of the local stakeholders composed of fishers, farmers, Non-Government Organization and Local Government Units, in a 3-day planning workshop. The reserves' RCI (0.20 to 0.40) resulted in fair (9 reserves) and poor (2 reserves) conditions as indicated by 64 to 68% of non-living and 32 to 36% of living slope substrate, CI of 0.15 to 0.54, CCI of 0.15 to 0.49, and fish biomass of 1.8 to 19.6 t km −2. One reserve with the highest ecological ranking was determined as a local monitoring station to educate local fishers and farmers. For other marine reserves with high ecological conditions and located outer of Leyte Gulf, the farming of Eucheuma sp., Holothuria sp. and Pinctada sp. were suggested. While, rearing of Haliotis sp., Siganus sp., or Scylla sp. in mangrove-friendly aquaculture systems, rice farming and eco-tourism were suggested for low ranking reserves. The potential benefits of these livelihoods and the success in conserving the marine resources may enhance the quality of life of the coastal populace if there is a strong multi-sectoral cooperation.","aid":null}

Tourists are guided through the wetland in search of primates and tropical birds. Village life and local culture are also experienced. This research investigated residents' attitudes towards tourism in Bigodi. Data were collected and analyzed with qualitative methods. Results show residents have consistently positive attitudes towards tourism. Positive attitudes result from resident's belief that tourism creates community development, improves agricultural markets, generates income, and finally, that tourism brings random good fortune. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action, it was hypothesized that positive attitudes would lead to pro-tourism behavior. Observations of behavior over 6 months in Bigodi support this hypothesis.

Protected since the 1970s, giraffes cohabit with humans in cultivated landscapes. This may not have appeared to pose many problems in the past, but the relationship between farmers and giraffes has deteriorated with the expansion of cultivated land and that of the giraffe population, with reported cases of giraffes damaging crops. A survey was conducted in all the affected villages in the Kouré area to establish the nature, severity and distribution of the damage and to evaluate the local populations' perception of the problem. Cowpeas are fed upon in the field at harvest time and in the granaries, as well as ripe mangoes, during the most critical period for giraffes' nutrition. The vast majority of farmers interviewed consider giraffes to be rather a problem in spite of tourism revenues they can obtain from them. This opinion has individually little correlation with damage rate on crops or easy access to tourism revenues. The damage risk factors are first and foremost considered as uncontrollable by the farmers, even if technical protection measures could easily be put in place locally. The interrelationships between the socioeconomic context and the way the problem is perceived are discussed.","aid":null}

We investigated whether ecosystem services influence household wealth in semi-arid rural Mali, where climate variability and soil degradation were expected to regulate subsistence production. Mean rainfall, mean rain use efficiency, and rain use efficiency trends (a land degradation proxy) over the last 25 years were used to quantify ecosystem services. Asset wealth was measured in 2527 households from 65 villages spanning the range in ecosystem services. We evaluated effects on wealth, controlling for household size and demographics, ethnicity, village size, crop selection, and distance to open water and markets. While wealth variation was dominated by demographics, significant associations with ecosystem services were observed. Predicted household wealth increased significantly (20%) with rainfall. Effects of rain use efficiency mean and trends were also significant, but only when conditioned on rainfall. With lower rainfall, wealth increased with mean rain use efficiency (+ 33%) but decreased with rain use efficiency trend (− 22%). With higher rainfall, however, wealth decreased with rain use efficiency (− 57%) and increased markedly with rain use efficiency trend (+185%). While ecosystem services are clearly important, their effect on rural poverty is complex and potentially obscured by coping strategies that mitigate environmental limitations.","aid":null}

S.","dAbstract":"There is a lack of consensus among conservationists as to whether trophy hunting represents a legitimate conservation tool in Africa. Hunting advocates stress that trophy hunting can create incentives for conservation where ecotourism is not possible. We assessed the hunting preferences of hunting clients who have hunted or plan to hunt in Africa (n = 150), and the perception among African hunting operators (n = 127) of client preferences at two US hunting conventions to determine whether this assertion is justified. Clients are most interested in hunting in well-known East and southern African hunting destinations, but some trophy species attract hunters to remote and unstable countries that might not otherwise derive revenues from hunting. Clients are willing to hunt in areas lacking high densities of wildlife or attractive scenery, and where people and livestock occur, stressing the potential for trophy hunting to generate revenues where ecotourism may not be viable. Hunting clients are more averse to hunting under conditions whereby conservation objectives are compromised than operators realize, suggesting that client preferences could potentially drive positive change in the hunting industry, to the benefit of conservation. However, the preferences and attitudes of some clients likely form the basis of some of the problems currently associated with the hunting industry in Africa, stressing the need for an effective regulatory framework.","aid":null}

A. and Liu J.","dAbstract":"Nature-based tourism has the potential to enhance global biodiversity conservation by providing alternative livelihood strategies for local people, which may alleviate poverty in and around protected areas. Despite the popularity of the concept of nature-based tourism as an integrated conservation and development tool, empirical research on its actual socioeconomic benefits, on the distributional pattern of these benefits, and on its direct driving factors is lacking, because relevant long-term data are rarely available. In a multi-year study in Wolong Nature Reserve, China, we followed a representative sample of 220 local households from 1999 to 2007 to investigate the diverse benefits that these households received from recent development of nature-based tourism in the area. Within eight years, the number of households directly participating in tourism activities increased from nine to sixty. In addition, about two-thirds of the other households received indirect financial benefits from tourism. We constructed an empirical household economic model to identify the factors that led to household-level participation in tourism. The results reveal the effects of local households' livelihood assets (i.e., financial, human, natural, physical, and social capitals) on the likelihood to participate directly in tourism. In general, households with greater financial (e.g., income), physical (e.g., access to key tourism sites), human (e.g., education), and social (e.g., kinship with local government officials) capitals and less natural capital (e.g., cropland) were more likely to participate in tourism activities. We found that residents in households participating in tourism tended to perceive more non-financial benefits in addition to more negative environmental impacts of tourism compared with households not participating in tourism. These findings suggest that socioeconomic impact analysis and change monitoring should be included in nature-based tourism management systems for long-term sustainability of protected areas.","aid":null}

Local people are expected to participate in CBNRM projects such as community forestry (CF) in order that the protected area management plan can be realized. The experiences of the local people are juxtaposed against the aims of these local biodiversity projects. Overall, it is accepted by the NGOs and government agencies that communities need to be involved in the design and management of the PA and that the protection of biodiversity resources can only occur with the provision of alternatives for local livelihood options to decrease land clearing for agriculture and harvesting of wild foods and animals. This case points to a basic misalignment between biodiversity conservation and CBNRM. Participants in this study contested the meaning and usefulness of the PA and the CF projects. Their concerns were cultural, social, economic and political, exposing uneven relations of power and uncertainty associated with the long term outcomes. Participation itself required scrutiny in this situation, as did the promotion of a global biodiversity 'good' over local understandings of place and landscape.

S. and Amezaga J. M. and Oyarzún R.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction Environmental decisions in general and the management of water resources in particular are complex, involve many uncertainties , and affect multiple actors and agencies (Reed, 2008). In modern democratic societies it is recognized and well established that affected communities have the right to participate in the decision making process along with project proponents and government agencies. This participation provides transparency and useful information, and contributes to greater social equity in the distribution of costs and benefits of project development. But to be successful, it requires a real conviction and commitment of all the involved parties. Moreover, an effective empowerment of local communities is needed through the delivery of knowledge and advice, and the possibility for stakeholders to actually participate in the decision making process (Reed, 2008). Public participation activities are increasingly being incorporated into policy development, natural resources, and catchment management strategies worldwide (Charnley and Engelbert, 2005; Newham et al., 2007; Dimitrakopoulos et al., 2010 ). Indeed, countries like South Africa and Canada, or the European Community, have explicitly incorporated issues such as decentralization and participation in their recent policies (EUWFD, 2000; Sherwill et al., 2007; Corkal and Hurlbert, 2008; De Stefano, 2010). The importance of participation is also now recognized by international organizations and forums, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which Chile joined in 2009. For example, a report of this organization states that \" broad participation helps us to debate for new ideas and sources of information \" and \" to develop a consensus on the need for action that leads to better implementation of sustainable development \" (Gramberger, 2001; Esteves and Vanclay, 2009). In a recent study of public participation in environmental impact assessment, O'Faircheallaigh (2010) concludes that \" more research is needed on the way in which the dynamic political processes, within which EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) is embedded, work out in specific contexts and influence the shape and extent of public participation in EIA, and on the way in which various forms of public participation relate to each other \" . Moreover, the very process of environmental impact assessment should be continuously evaluated . Despite the existence of a broad literature on this regard, there are only a few references to this topic for Latin American countries (Toro et al., 2010). This also extends in general to the evaluation of the effectiveness of participation programs, i.e. how the interested and affected people are identified, how the public is informed, and how their inputs are considered and affect the decisions (Charnley and Engelbert, 2005; Reed, 2008; De Stefano, 2010). Based on these ideas, and taking the case of Chile as an example, the situation analyzed in this paper illustrates the inadequacy of the mere adoption of laws or procedures in force in developed countries, without the prior, or at least concurrent, actions and programs of education and support that enables them to function effectively and fulfill their purpose. The main objectives of the paper are two-fold: First, to provide a general description and a critical analysis of the stakeholder participation process within the Environmental Impact Assessment System (SEIA in Spanish) in Chile after ca. 14 years of being operational . Second, to describe a situation for a representative basin of North-Central Chile (Elqui basin), assessing the degree of knowledge of local stakeholders regarding institutions, tools and processes related to their actual engagement and participation possibilities. From this base we intend to raise concern on selected aspects that could be addressed to improve the effectiveness of the existing framework in Chile, as well as in other developing countries , where immature environmental impact assessment and public management systems face similar pressures in relation to the sustainable use of their natural resources.","aid":null}

Another relevant issue is to share the experiences regarding SD incorporation in the academic area. Design/methodology/approach – Capacity building courses to \" educate-the-educators, \" is the selected approach, to educate faculty regarding SD. Additionally, diverse methods are utilized to assess progress in incorporation of SD into courses and curricula. The capacity building is done through specific courses that are taught by faculty members with recognised knowledge in their fields but who also had the interdisciplinary skills to help the educators to understand and apply the concepts of the \" triple bottom line \" , to their academic programme. The educational programme is focused upon educators who expressed personal and professional interest in expanding their skills to teach SD to their students. Findings – It is learned that working to catalyze the inclusion of SD concepts into courses and curricula requires a concerted effort among various stakeholders within the institution. It needs support from top administration, deans of academic divisions, the academic development department, as well as from faculty willing to participate in incorporating SD into their courses. Without this support, advances will be slow or non-existent. A first course to incorporate SD in the educators' courses is offered, but one difficulty that the authors encountered, with this initial course, is it does not provided an integrated and interconnected outlook, which shows the learners not only the triple bottom line concepts but also other dimensions relevant to SD. So, a second course is designed and evaluation of the improvements in SD understanding by educators who take this improved course is done using conceptual maps. Although no definitive instruments are developed, work is done on the development and testing of criteria to assess the degree of incorporation of SD into the modified courses taught by the participating faculty. Originality/value – It is shown that it is possible to support efforts to \" weave SD as a golden thread \" into the academic component of a HEI can be accomplished through the concerted action of various stakeholders. Good team teaching can facilitate faculty capacity building in SD. The evolutionary path of the \" educate-the-educator's \" program is one of the learnings by doing and continuous improvement.

Introduction The interrelationship between traditional culture and biodiversity conservation has been documented in the last 10 years in China (Chen et al., 2008; Pei, 1996; He and He, 2000; Xu and Liu, 1995). These studies have documented how, through historical processes, local ethnic groups have developed very close interrelationship with local animals, plants and forests, and formed distinctive diversified indigenous knowledge systems and traditional cultural beliefs. These culture sites, particular sacred sites are ecological unique and important for conservation on varying scale of landscape, community and species (Salick et al., 2007). With their rich knowledge practical understanding regarding the use and conservation of animals, plants and the eco-system as a whole, these knowledge systems and associated practices, embedded in traditional cultures, have become the social and technical foundations for mutual coordination and sustainable development of local inhabitants and their local environment (Xu and Liu, 1995; Zhang, 1995; Pei, 1996; Rao, 1996). Several studies have drawn attention to the role of indigenous knowledge and cultural beliefs in biodiversity conservation, which were later called 'development approaches' in China (Liu, 2006; Rao, 1996). These issues are not unique to China. For some traditional cultures, e.g. North America's indigenous peoples or First Nations, the land and water are considered sacred, as are their associated flora and fauna, and the sky above (Lauwrence, 2003). Indigenous peoples in many parts of the world imbue headlands, springs, trees and forest with religious meanings (Lauwrence, 2003). Wilson (1984) suggested the term ''biophilia'', implying that there is a genetic basis for human beings' the love of nature. This paper takes the Baima Tibetans as a case study, and contributes to on-going efforts to document the significance of traditional culture in biodiversity conservation. The paper illustrates the trends in the Baima Tibetans' perspectives towards their traditional culture, highlights the dilemmas and difficult situations faced by Baima Tibetan related to nature conservation and biodiversity protection within a contested environment created by on-going processes of economic development and social changes. Keywords: China Gansu Province Traditional culture Forest biodiversity Wildlife Baima Tibetan A B S T R A C T Baima Tibetans, a unique ethnic group inhabiting the hilly regions of the southern tip of Gansu Province, possess ancient religious beliefs and rich traditional knowledge. Baima Tibetans have developed their culture, traditional beliefs, knowledge, customs and resource use systems through their productive activities and living practices over many generations. These have played a critical role in conserving local biodiversity, including the giant panda, and preserving the livelihoods of local inhabitants. People in the local Baima community have a great sense of self-identity that is related to their traditional beliefs and knowledge. They possess a strong recognition of the role that traditional beliefs play in protecting their villages and conserving the wealth of biodiversity. Consequently, Baima peoples respect their traditional ways and the customary regulations of the village that relate to the conservation and use of natural resources. Biodiversity conservation and community development have faced challenges in Baima Tibetan communities in recent times, which are largely due to the imposition by external actors of a powerful development model based on modern scientific knowledge and technologies, a model that usually neglects the role that traditional religious beliefs, production practices, and local governance systems play in biodiversity conservation and community development. In this paper we analyze of these issues on how the Baima Tibetan people's traditional knowledge, practices, and local institutions may be better utilized to meet biodiversity conservation and community development needs in the future. ß 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Benefits included park-based employment, tourism revenue sharing, integrated conservation and development projects, and resource access agreements. Losses were caused by park-protected animals raiding crops and preying on livestock. Local perceptions of benefit and loss associated with the park were collected from focus groups and a household survey. Valuation data were derived from interviews, the survey, and measurement of crop losses. Eight villages accrued an annual net benefit as a result of the park, while 17 villages accrued a net loss. Net benefitting villages were located near park-based employment and resource access associations involved in beekeeping. Households within 0.5 km of the park boundary accrued the highest losses, while benefits distributed up to 15 km away. The Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA) needs to focus benefits closer to the park boundary to support those who lose most from park-protected animals, and away from areas with park-based employment to more evenly distribute benefits around the circumference of the park. Attitudes toward the park appear to be shaped by loss aversion, suggesting UWA and conservation agencies should focus on loss mitigation, rather than benefit provision.","aid":null}

Financial and social costs associated with crop raiding were studied in 25 villages around Kibale National Park, Uganda. Perceptions about crop raiding were collected using focus groups and household surveys, while damage was evaluated based on physical monitoring of crop raiding incidents. The average financial loss for farmers around the park over six months was US$74 (1.5% of median household capital asset wealth) and damage was particularly high within 0.5 km of the park boundary. Households experiencing crop raiding were more prone to food insecurity, and higher rates of self-reported human and livestock diseases, while children from villages bordering the park tended to have poorer scholastic achievement. Compensation is not affordable for the wildlife authority, nor is it sustainable as crop raiding is escalating.

This paper examines the perceptions and attitudes of the dwellers of village forest and en-croachers towards biodiversity conservation under the rights enshrined in the Forest Rights Act 2006. A survey was conducted in190 households in four village forests and two encroached villages under reserved forests of Sonitpur and Golaghat districts of Assam in Northeast India. The majority of the respondents were found to have positive attitudes towards environmental issues in general and protection of biodiversity loss in particular. Village-type, residents' occupation, caste, source of fuel for cooking, educational qualifications and size of land holding were found to be significantly associated with attitudes towards biodiversity conservation. It is concluded that conducting an environmental education program and rights-holders' monitoring system on the impact of their use of forest resources will support conservation of biodiversity.","aid":null}

R. and Thapa S. K. and Schreckenberg K. and Luttrell C.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION Community Forestry in Nepal has been very progressive and well known over the last three decades as an institutional innovation that enables local users to control and manage forestry resources for the improvement of their livelihoods. To date the Government of Nepal has handed over about 1.6 million hectares of forest land (over 25% of the total forest area of Nepal) to more than 14 000 Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs), which comprise nearly 38% of the total population of the country (GoN 2007). Yet, in spite of its recognised potential to improve the livelihoods of the rural poor (Paudyal et al. 2006), community forestry has not yet fulfilled expectations regarding increased returns to forest users (McDougall et al. 2007). Several studies have shown that poor, vulnerable and socially excluded members of CFUGs like women, the very poor, migrants, Dalits and marginalised Janajatis 1 receive fewer benefits from community forestry (Maharjan 1998, Malla et al. 2003). Who loses and who gains is still a burning issue in community forestry. Wealthier and more powerful members of CFUGs often dominate community forestry processes and the institutional arrangements that oversee their implementation (McDougall et al. 2007). This eventually produces an outcome that perpetuates or even reinforces social inequity, creating negative impacts on the poor and socially excluded, who may lose access to their rights to receive benefits and improve their livelihoods from community forestry (Brown et al. 2002, Edmunds and Wollenberg 2003). Most studies of the livelihood impact of community forestry in Nepal have been conducted in the Middle Hills region (e.g. Dev et al. 2003, Maharjan 1998, Malla et al. 2003, McDougall et al. 2007). As community forestry has been expanded to the lowland Terai region, with its commercially valuable timber resources, there has been growing interest in how returns from timber sales can contribute to poverty reduction (e.g. Bampton and Cammaert 2007, Iversen et al. 2006). However, to date there has been no direct and comprehensive study of the livelihood impacts of community forestry in this ecological zone. This also applies to the Churia region, which lies on the northern edge of the Terai (and is sometimes included in descriptions of the Terai), bordering the Middle Hills. A fragile environment, prone to landslides and erosion, and designated by the government for water recharge for the plains area, this ethnically mixed area is also the destination for a growing number of migrants from the Hills as a result of decreased land availability in the Terai. Implementation of community forestry in this area is characterised by CFUGs and civil society organisations (like the Federation of Community Forest Users of Nepal – FECOFUN) that are very aware of 'second generation' community forestry issues (Carter and Gronow 2005, Lawrence 2007) such as poverty reduction, gender equity, democratic process and governance. Some, like CARE Nepal's Churia Action Program (CAP) and its USAIDfunded Strengthened Actions for Governance in Utilization of Natural Resources (SAGUN) Program, have tried to introduce programmes specifically designed to increase the wellbeing of the poor, vulnerable and socially excluded people living in these areas. This has included taking on board many of the suggestions made by Pokharel and Nurse (2004, cited in Carter and Gronow 2005) for pro-poor strategies to address the livelihood needs of the poor, such as using wellbeing ranking to identify the poor, improving CFUG governance, allocating forest land to the poor, using CFUG funds to provide low interest loans, relief and scholarships to poor households, and forging alliances between government, projects and NGOs to support propoor integrated development planning. CFUGs in the CARE project area could therefore be expected to be examples of 'good practice' community forestry. This paper reports on the results of the Nepal component of a three-country action research project investigating the impacts of participatory forest management on poverty (ARPIP) 2 . The Nepal research was conducted in 2006-7 by CARE Nepal to understand and improve the livelihood impacts of community forestry in the Churia, Bhawar and Terai regions. The research was designed to answer several basic questions: 1. Can community forestry contribute to poverty reduction or livelihood improvement by providing rural people with a sustainable stream of net benefits greater than those obtained under a non-community forestry situation? 2. How significant are the benefits of community forestry for different wellbeing groups? What are the key negative impacts of community forestry and on whom do they fall? 3. What characteristics of community forestry determine its impacts (both positive and negative) on poverty and equity? The paper begins with an introduction to the research methodology, study sites and analytical framework, followed by a presentation of the results and a subsequent discussion structured around the three research questions.","aid":null}

K. and Rao K. S. and Kandari L. S. and Joshi R. and Dhyani D.","dAbstract":"a b group of over 20 NGOs by 2004. A total of 14 farmers' training programmes on MAPs were organized in Bageshwar, Chamoli, Almora, Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag, Pauri, Tehri and Uttarkashi districts of Uttaranchal, where a total of 536 participants (469 farmers, 39 extension workers from NGOs and 28 members of the government) were trained (Table 2). Forward and background linkages play a major role in farmer's participation and adoption of MAPs cultivation. Participation of all the stakeholders is essential for enabling farmers in leveraging the support for application of rural technologies/techniques in a sustained manner. Towards this end, farmers/participants of Ghuni-Ramni village, Chamoli district were linked to the district cooperative bank, by which they could access financial assistance (credit) for large-scale cultivation of MAPs. Though at present there are no prescribed guidelines for the amount of credit that can be given for a MAP entrepreneur, based on the cost– benefit analyses from research work 4,10 , stage-wise credit requirements are being worked out by the policy planners (Table 3). Most of the institutions working on medicinal plants cultivation and conservation in the Himalayan region are still largely organized along conventional and sectoral lines, while the challenges of medicinal plant cultivation/conservation call for approaches that cut across disciplines, sectors, ecological conditions and institutions. Given these concerns, the need to establish linkages among different departments of central and state governments and among government and NGOs is indeed great. Networking and direct collaboration of different agencies would go a long way towards identifying and developing appropriate solutions through the exchange of knowledge on a regular basis. Effective mechanisms should be identified to promote and sustain institutional collaboration and networking 11 . The crosssectoral approach should include mechanisms for cultivation, conservation, management, marketing, etc. which can improve the economic returns of the people while conserving natural resources. Institutional arrangements have to ensure peoples' participation through a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach, ensuring that each household takes part in the decision-making process. The components of the bottom-up approach of development should be identified based on an in-depth analysis of traditional knowledge and institutions 12,13 . The Uttaranchal government has proposed to implement an identification scheme of medicinal plant producers, wherein details of area and species under cultivation will be documented in the identity book given to each of the farmers. Officials from Forest Department will make an estimate of harvestable produce before the farmer plans to harvest the crop. These details are entered in a permit given to the farmers to export the material to the end-user or agent with whom they have contracts. Though this procedure is felt as a bottleneck for cultivators, the export of produce from the wild could be reduced by strict implementation of such schemes. The government also insists that the end-users declare their source of produce to restrict harvest from the wild. The government can increase the area under cultivation by ensuring similar credit facilities for crops and MAPs. A survey carried out as a part of follow-up evaluation of farmers' training on MAPs showed many of the limitations faced by the majority of the trainers/participants while implementing/starting cultivation of MAPs under different agro-climatic conditions. It revealed that fewer number of farmers, particularly in Almora, Bageshwar, Chamoli and Pithoragarh districts have started cultivation and nursery raising (Table 4). The main reasons are: (i) Lack of consistent support in terms of technical know- how. (ii) Little experience or capacity. (iii) Problems in getting planting materials (seeds/seedlings ) to start nursery and cultivation. (iv) Lack of credit for purchase of planting materials, land improvement, etc. (v) Lack of promotional activities to familiarize farmers with potential of MAPs as cash crops. Steps taken by the Central and State governments and their line departments to remove the above-mentioned difficulties have not been sufficient. The resources devoted and programmes designed for the development and diffusion of agro-technologies need to be augmented. Efforts to develop planting materials, processing and semi-processing facilities at important collection and cultivation points to add value to the raw materials, proper and better marketing opportunities through farmer's cooperatives and appropriate insurance schemes to reduce farmer's risk need to be promoted. Even before and after the creation of the state of Uttaranchal , medicinal plant cultivation and conservation has clearly been identified as a potential resource for uplifting the state's economy. With a change in the development paradigm , that is bringing people to the centre of all activities, the issue of medicinal plants cultivation has been prioritized. The newly created hill state of Uttaranchal has identified medicinal plants cultivation and its marketing as an important aspect of the state's economic sector. Government policies have so far had a marginal impact on the cultivation and marketing of medicinal plant produce and have thus indirectly favoured illegal collection from the forests. If MAPs cultivation is to be made economically and ecologically sustainable, there is a need to adopt appropriate policy, which must integrate the cultivation of MAPs with the local peoples' socio-economic development. The policies governing medicinal plant cultivation/development and the role of the government, e.g. ground rules for medicinal and aromatic plant cultivators/farmers, market and marketing, timely availability of good quality of seeds, planting materials, etc. need to be given due importance. Certain policy recommendations are to be considered, examined and implemented to fully utilize medicinal plants for socio-economic development of the region 14 . Major outcomes of the farmers' training programme on MAPs are the following. FFTPs on MAPs have built up the capabilities of farmer groups/local people, extension workers from NGOs and government organization (GOs) involved in promoting cultivation and conservation of MAPs in the region. It has helped participants change their attitudes considerably towards the role and value of medicinal plants in the current changing scenario at the national and global level. @BULLET Establishment of nurseries for raising quality planting materials of MAPs for large-scale cultivation. @BULLET Farmers/NGOs who learnt the agro-technology of specific species (one or two) started experimenting with other species. @BULLET Ankur, an NGO trained through this programme, started raising a large number of seedlings of P. kurrooa and S. costus and the income generated is being used to strengthen the on-going activities of the organization. Several farmers started earning money by selling planting materials raised in their nurseries. @BULLET Demonstration of efficiency of combining indigenous knowledge with scientific technologies resulting in innovations. If participatory action research is to achieve a real impact on promotion of cultivation of MAPs, their productivity and livelihoods, appropriate technologies for capacity building and dissemination of information have to be developed. Participatory approaches and training programmes facilitated the farmers' demand for knowledge and provided them with an opportunity to choose, test and start cultivating MAPs according to their land capability and climate. GBPIHED is one among several organizations which are involved in testing, developing and demonstrating action research to create a conducive atmosphere and relation between farmers, extension officers and R&D institutions. These relationships are thought to be a fundamental tool, allowing scientists to collect appropriate data/information and to transform them into developed technologies/products adapted to farmers' needs. No single institution can meet all the challenges involved in the medicinal plant sector. The problems can only be overcome by building effective partnerships between farmers/ growers, extension agents, private sector, NGOs/GOs, researchers and policy makers and, more importantly by enhancing information exchange. Experiences from farmers training on MAPs in Uttaranchal have shown that the training components and information manuals, etc. can be used to stimulate information exchange, design and test agro-technology and increase the pace of MAPs cultivation. The challenge is to bring indigenous, and science and technology inputs together under one umbrella to meet the growing demand of the society. The experience of medicinal plant sector confirms that government policies dealing with MAPs cultivation, collection and marketing must be set in the context of wider development objectives and a well-defined direction of social change. Though the government of Uttaranchal has introduced policies to promote and strengthen cultivation and conservation together, these policies have not shown desired results. In developing a policy regarding the medicinal plant sector, inputs from all the stakeholders not only provide important insights, but are also necessary for developing effective management plans.","aid":null}

E. and Kolawole O. D. and Mbaiwa J. E.","dAbstract":"This review analyses the potential of tourism to contribute to biodiversity conservation with particular reference to developing countries. In the last quarter of a century, there has been a global concern about the extent of biodiversity decline. Biodiversity decline is partly a result of the overutilization of resources by local communities who live in resource-rich areas. This review makes use of published and unpublished articles and reports on community-based approaches to biodiversity conservation. Focus was paid to the role that community-based or integrated approaches play in the promotion of biodiversity conservation. The review indicates that where community-based tourism projects are being undertaken, they have mixed results. That is, some projects have collapsed, while others are succeeding in generating the expected economic benefits such as income, employment and funds used for community projects. The Southern African countries of Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe have been implementing community-based tourism projects for almost two decades. Economic benefits from tourism contribute to poverty alleviation and improved livelihoods. In the process, local communities have developed positive attitudes towards biodiversity, and hence are more inclined to use such resources sustainably. The paper concludes that tourism could serve as a potential tool for stimulating biodiversity conservation and rural development not only in developing countries but also in other similar social–ecological contexts. Review Methodology: We used published and unpublished academic articles and reports, which address the role that local communities in developing countries have adopted in community-based approaches to biodiversity conservation. Data obtained for the review focused on the role that tourism play through ecotourism and community-based approaches in achieving biodiversity conservation in nature-based tourism destinations. Where particular examples of community-based approaches to biodiversity are given (e.g. Botswana), government policy documents, consultancy reports, CBNRM project reports, other tourism development reports and academic articles were used as data sources. Attention was given to the successes and failures of community-based approaches in achieving biodiversity conservation. Data were also obtained from ongoing research on CBNRM development in Botswana and Southern Africa.","aid":null}

The resultant increasing pressure that is placed on the livelihoods of rural people leads to desperate and poor agricultural practices, which in turn cause further degradation of natural resources. The LandCare programme of the South African national government aims to address these problems by facilitating rural agricultural projects that are sustainable in the long term. This paper summarises the development of a new set of project selection criteria for the evaluation of project proposals in order to compile an effective LandCare programme portfolio. The new project selection criteria were developed through a review of current literature, existing criteria applied in previously selected projects and interviews with key stakeholders during project site visits. These site visits were also used to determine criterion weights, which were calculated using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a known decision-analysis technique. The established set of criteria was applied to three case studies in South Africa, up.ac.za).

A strong incentive emerges for rural people to adopt wildlife management as an adjunct to subsistence agriculture, and therefore, to promote conservation of natural ecosystems and wildlife habitats in the face of growing human population and demand for land. Dependence on agriculture has depleted the wildlife resource outside protected areas and has been less effective in improving the wealth and living standards of most rural people. This study illustrates that the Malawi Department of National Parks and Wildlife needs to introduce economic incentives that integrate biological conservation with economic development for the rural people.

The Indian Government followed this approach and chose the method to segregate the landscape for conservation of the ecosystem as well as for the development of the local economy and its people. We have examined the effect of this policy and concurrently developed a theoretical modeling approach to understand how human behavior is changing under shifting political, socioeconomic and environmental conditions. A specific focus has been on how the landscape is changing in the mountains of the Indian Himalayan region where about 10% of the total geographical area is converted into protected landscape for conservation of biodiversity. For local people living in the Himalayan mountains in India, agriculture is the main land use activity and is strongly linked to the forests in providing sustainability. There are several branches in the rural ecosystems where the local people's economy was centered. These include agriculture, animal husbandry, medicinal and aromatic plants cultivation, forest resource collection, tourism and other occupations. The greatest proportion of the population was engaged in the agriculture sector, whose contribution is high in the rural economy (61%); followed by animal husbandry (19%), forest resource collection for economic gain (18%), and medicinal and aromatic plants cultivation (1.5%). However, three decades ago the animal husbandry branch of the rural ecosystem was contributing the maximum share towards rural household income (40%) followed by tourism (35.2%), and lastly agriculture (14%). The desire of farmers to secure the optimum output from agricultural land use has resulted in an increase for resource collection from the forests. The people's perception (n=1,648) regarding overall changes occurring in the region was varied and most showed that the current trend within rural ecosystems has emerged because of the implementation of conservation policies/creation of national park and biosphere reserve (80%), followed by limitation (22%), climate (20%), population growth (7%), national economy (10%) and least by socioeconomic change (5%). The theoretical agent model developed here draws attention to agent/farmer behavior and land resource use for his livelihood in the temporal dimension. The current study would be helpful to introduce new approaches for the development of the methodological and theoretical aspects associated with the complex human and ecosystem interactions in the Himalayan mountains for sustainable landscape development.","aid":null}

E. and Arancibia E.","dAbstract":"INTRODUCTION In recent years, commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been widely promoted as an appropriate means of developing tropical forest resources (Lawrence 2003, Arnold and Ruiz Pérez 1998, Ruiz Pérez and Arnold 1996). This reflects a growing recognition of the contribution made by many NTFPs to rural livelihoods, both in terms of supporting subsistence and as a means of generating financial income (Arnold and Ruiz Pérez 1998, Belcher 2003). At the same time, because harvesting of NTFPs is generally considered to be less damaging to forest resources than timber extraction, NTFP exploitation is widely believed to be relatively compatible with forest conservation (Arnold and Ruiz Pérez 1998, Belcher 2003, Peters 1996). Thus, commercialization of NTFPs potentially offers a means of achieving both conservation and development goals concurrently (Plotkin and Famolare 1992, Counsell and Rice 1992), by increasing the value of forest resources to local communities (the \" conservation-through-use \" or \" use it or lose it \" principle; Dickinson et al. 1996). Recent reviews suggest that approaches to NTFP commercialization have not, however, been universally successful, and that the scope for improving rural livelihoods through NTFPs is in doubt (Tonen and Wiersum 2005). For example, Sheil and Wunder (2002) suggest that donor investments for the development of NTFP resources have often been misdirected, and expectations of local income generation potential have frequently been unrealistic. Many NTFPs have been harvested destructively or unsustainably, resulting in resource degradation (Peters 1996). In a comprehensive review of NTFP commercialization, http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol11/iss2/art24/ Neumann and Hirsch (2000) indicate that sale of NTFPs often tends to provide a low level of income for the poorest section of communities, rather than providing a method of socioeconomic advancement. The NTFP trade may actually perpetuate poverty rather than alleviate it (Neumann and Hirsch 2000). Belcher (2003) notes that the term \" NTFP \" encompasses a very wide range of forest products and marketing systems, and although some NTFPs appear to be successful in alleviating poverty and contributing to forest conservation, others are harvested very intensively in a manner that results in some stakeholders being excluded from the process. Given that NTFPs are highly diverse in terms of their ecological and socioeconomic characteristics, there is a need to define which NTFPs have particular potential for development, and under what conditions their use is likely to make a positive contribution to both human livelihoods and forest conservation (Belcher 2003, Lawrence 2003). Such information would help reduce the misdirection of donor investments identified by Sheil and Wunder (2002). However, the high diversity of NTFPs challenges the development of a firm theoretical framework that would enable the potential impacts or outcomes of NTFP commercialization to be predicted. The scientific literature relating to NTFPs, although copious, tends to be characterized by detailed investigations of individual case studies, with relatively little attention given to synthesis, generality, or theory (Neumann and Hirsch 2000). Such developments have been hampered by the lack of an analytical framework that would enable the results from different case studies to be integrated and compared (Arnold and Ruiz Pérez 1996). Researchers at the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), in Indonesia, have recently developed an analytical approach for classifying NTFP case studies and assessing their development potential, using multivariate statistical approaches. The method aims to simplify the diversity of NTFP case studies by identifying \" typologies, \" or groups of case studies sharing common characteristics. The initial analysis using this method described by Ruiz Pérez and Byron (1999) was based on only nine case studies, limiting the generality of the results (Marshall et al. 2003). However, more recently, the approach has been applied to a much larger number (61) of case studies (Ruiz Pérez et al. 2004). Results were used to group cases into classes according to different household economic strategies, each of which varied in their degree of dependence on NTFPs as a source of income. Such analyses may be of value in highlighting broad groupings of NTFP case studies. However, the existence of discrete strategies remains open to doubt; rather, the data presented by CIFOR illustrate continuous variation among the case studies with respect to the variables considered. In addition, these analyses provide little insight into the relationship between the characteristics of an NTFP and the impact of its commercialization on livelihoods or natural resources. The main limitation of the CIFOR approach is its dependence on correlation; even when relationships are defined, no causation can be inferred. In this paper, we describe an alternative approach to analyzing the characteristics of different NTFP case studies. Specifically, our objective was to develop a method that would enable the impact of NTFP commercialization on livelihoods to be predicted on the basis of scoring a common set of attributes. In order to make such predictions, some form of modeling approach is required. Progress with developing predictive models of NTFP commercialization has been very limited to date (Arnold and Ruiz Pérez 1998). Most of the models that are available are entirely conceptual in nature (Wilkie and Godoy 1996, Homma 1996). As noted by Arnold and Ruiz Pérez (1998), deterministic models for the management and use of NTFPs are likely to have limited applicability because of the complexity and variability of the situations under which NTFP commercialization takes place. Furthermore, as interdisciplinarity is an essential feature of NTFP research (Neumann and Hirsch 2000), an analytical framework is required that enables different forms of information to be integrated and analyzed, including qualitative and quantitative data drawn from ecological, economic, and social research. We propose that Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) provide an appropriate method for developing predictive models of NTFP commercialization. This method represents information in the form of probabilities, enabling many different sources of data to be integrated and analyzed according to a common framework. The use of a probabilistic, rather than a deterministic, approach to modeling also avoids many of the problems described by Arnold and Ruiz Pérez (1998). Presentation of model output in the form of probabilities has the added advantage of being relevant to the needs of decision makers, who in the context of NTFPs require an assessment of risk associated with a particular investment option. Here, we provide a brief description of BBNs and their application to management of natural resources (Append. 1). We then describe the construction of a BBN to predict the livelihood impacts of NTFP commercialization, according to an analytical framework focusing on the different capital assets required to support livelihoods. The BBN described here was designed to incorporate information generated by an interdisciplinary research project (CEPFOR) that examined the factors influencing NTFP commercialization in 19 case studies from Mexico and Bolivia (Marshall et al. 2003Marshall et al. , 2006). We validate the BBN using field data gathered by this project, and illustrate how the BBN can be used as a model to predict the impacts of NTFP commercialization on livelihoods and to explore the potential impacts of policy interventions. The contribution of this model to development of a general theory of NTFP management and use is then discussed.","aid":null}

However, little attention has been paid to research on views of local people in their potential roles as service providers. In this research we explore perspectives of poor people living in a National Park in Vietnam, where introduction of PES is being considered. In-depth interviews and workshops were conducted – with strong emphasis on the use of visual techniques, to help facilitate learning processes and provide insight into local perspectives. From the research, two models were developed to indicate general factors that influence the likelihood of people adopting, and adhering to, PES schemes. We suggest these models can be used to guide the design of PES. Our findings also reveal three main requirements important in design of pro-poor PES: (1) Thorough scoping studies for ensuring that schemes are based on sound understanding of potential providers' perspectives and context. (2) Such studies should emphasise qualitative research and draw on participatory tools, to facilitate open dialogue and co-learning by researchers and participants. (3) Policy makers should consider designing hybridized schemes, i.e., in which PES concepts are combined with integrated conservation and development.","aid":null}

The establishment of MPAs has increased greatly in recent years mostly due to international commitments to the establishment of a global network of MPAs by 2012. MPAs have the potential to strongly affect the fishing industry, and their success depends, at least partly, on fishers' attitudes towards this management measure. However, research on MPAs tends to focus on the ecological and conservation aspects of this management approach and not on its human dimensions. Studies in attitudes, perceptions, beliefs and preferences related to MPA issues have been identified as priority social science topics in need of research. We present a 'rapid review', conducted systematically, of the literature published up to September 2009 and aimed at identifying the most investigated topics related to commercial fishers' attitudes towards MPAs, describing the main findings from these studies, and analysing the implications for management. Most published work focuses on fishers' attitudes towards issues of governance, conservation of biodiversity and the environment, and the impact of MPAs on fishing activity. Despite the recent increase in the literature on the human dimensions of MPAs, the present review reveals that little of this literature originates from empirical studies. Hence, given the forthcoming increase in the implementation of MPAs in the near future, research on fishers' attitudes towards these management measures is critically needed.","aid":null}

These negative attitudes can be changed by conservation education. The results of the study were used to design an educational programme addressed, as a priority, to fishermen of Lake Visthonis and aiming at highlighting the values of the wetlands and the sustainable use of its resources.

This paper empirically analyses this issue using a dataset collected from interviews in three regions in northwestern Pakistan, with a total of 180 observations. Our findings reveal that 59% of households derive their income from the forests. Other factors, such as household size, alternative sources of income, literate adult males, distance to market, distance to forest and geographic location affect household economic dependence on the forest. Results from Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve analysis prove that supplemental forest income helps in reducing economic inequality among the sample households. The study suggests that forest income supplements total household income and reduces economic inequality. Thus sustainable management of natural forests is not only important for ecological but also for economic and social sustainability, especially in remote and marginal areas. Successful future forest policies for ensuring economic and ecological sustainability should target programmes that ameliorate current extraction pressure on natural forests, promote alternative income sources, build human capital, improve market access and ensure equitable access rights to forest resources for communities living in the uplands. This may improve socioeconomic conditions of poor forest communities, thereby reducing income disparity. Overall, this would help in achieving sustainable forest utilization and management.","aid":null}

A. and Nabanyumya R. and Mupada E. and Persha L.","dAbstract":"HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: PEOPLE AND FOREST CONSERVATION IN AFRICA The history of post Iron Age people-forest interactions in Africa can be divided into three periods (Rodgers, 1993; Wily and Mbaya, 2001): @BULLET precolonial occupation, when people were free to convert and use forest land; @BULLET the colonial and postcolonial period which excluded people from closed forest land; @BULLET the recent period of changing conservation involving forms of community forest management. Before colonization, people clearly used forest resources as evidenced by the great decrease in forest extent in eastern Africa as the Iron Age spread from the northwest (Hamilton, 1984). There is some evidence of conservation of natural resources; scarce resources, such as water springs and dry-season grazing, were husbanded through development of rules, regulations and community sanctions. Forests were also conserved, but primarily for a value other than the resources they contain: they provided a refuge, and often took on a religious significance. The Wa-jikenda of the Kenyan coastal forests, for example, protected kayas, or forest patches, for religious reasons. The colonial period was characterized by a deliberate separation of people from the legal use of, or access to, closed forest , as colonial powers reserved forests for provision of water and timber resources for the State (Rodgers, 1993; Newmark, 2002). Much of East Africa's forest estate was reserved before the First World War. After independence most governments continued colonial practices ; more forests were reserved and more people were excluded. But gradually government forest institutions lost their funding and the capacity to conserve, which resulted in rapid forest degradation. More recently, there have been changes in East African forestry, as elsewhere in the tropics, with the emergence of community forest management (management driven by communities, usually on community land) and joint forest management (where rights of ownership and management are held jointly by communities and the State). This shift in management policy started slowly in East Africa, and relied a great deal on the Indian experience . Acceptance of the concept was slow, but as elsewhere, the increasingly obvious failure of underfunded government forestry gave credence to possible alternatives – primarily for management of forests and woodlands of localized value. Forests have lost biodiversity value over the past hundred years of management , primarily under government control (Burgess and Clarke, 2000; Hamil ton, 1984; Hamilton and Bensted-Smith, 1990; Howard, 1991; Lovett and Wasser, 1993; Newmark, 2002). At first the loss was deliberate as the forest estate was managed for timber production and a few high-value species were favoured. Selective felling was used to eliminate climbers, figs and what were termed \" weed trees \" . As natural forests were seen to have slow rates of timber tree recruitment, some were replaced with plantations of exotic softwoods.","aid":null}
{"filename":"Ruiz Mallen 2005","year":2005,"title":"Environmental learning in adolescents from a Mexican community involved in forestry","authors":"Ruiz-Malle´nmalle´n I. and Barraza L.","dAbstract":"Introduction Environmental problems generally stem from social problems (Iozzi 1998). A telling example is the loss of forest cover in many wooded regions owing to the expansion of farming. This is the community's way of overcoming hunger and improving their economy in the short run. Yet one of the greatest obstacles to forest conservation lies in the attitudes, values and lifestyles of the social actors who are dependent on the forest for their livelihood. Mexico is one of the few countries in the world where rural communities have extensive managerial control over forests (Bray and (2002) point out that community management in Mexico is 20 years ahead of the international trend to restore the collective ownership or control of forests. Nonetheless , in many Mexican rural communities, forest management is scarce and of poor quality (Rodrı´guezRodrı´guezZù n˜igan˜iga 2003), which contributes to some of these being amongst the poorest and most marginalised in the country. This situation is, in part, due to the lack of forest management plans tailored to the social and environmental context of each community. One of the major Mexican forestry production states is Michoaca´nMichoaca´n, located in the west of the country. Yet, in 1998 only 10 per cent of forests had management plans (Secretarıá de medio ambiente y recursos naturales 2002). The solutions and opportunities proposed to improve this state of affairs are mainly political and educational. They are, on the one hand, to implement viable government programmes to promote the proper management of forest resources and to facilitate the development of communities able to set up community forest enterprises. On the other hand, they involve increasing local participation in the decision-making processes and raising awareness so as to generate more interest in forest management and to foster a change in the lifestyles and values of those who work this asset. A sound strategy for success with many of these actions lies in education for sustainability, Isabel Ruiz Mallen holds a master's degree in biological sciences and is currently working on a doctorate in environmental sciences at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Her research relates to educational processes and the participation of young people in environmental projects in indigenous Mexican communities.

She is a full-time research worker at the Ecosystems Research Centre of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

She also explores the process whereby human communities acquire, communicate and assimilate ecological knowledge.

We are currently launching the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005–2014), proposed in 2002 at the Johannesburg Summit, which seeks to transform formal and non-formal educational sectors worldwide by redirecting educational policies and practices to promote the following aspects (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2005 The state of Michoaca´nMichoaca´n is one of the three Mexican states that exhibit the biggest educational deficit (Soria and Regalado, 2005). This backwardness is measured in terms of education enrolment and drop-out rates. Almost 80 per cent of all municipalities exhibit average and very high rates of marginalisation (Soria and Regalado 2005). The teaching issue is, moreover, one of the problems that has held back improvements to the quality of education in the state. Formal education still advocates unsustainable values and practices in society because it seeks to promote competitiveness and consumerism instead of cooperation and conservation (Barraza 2002 ). The current educational plans raise the following problems as regards the study of the local environment (Comisio´nComisio´n estatal de ecologıá 2004): & The time devoted to specific content related to environmental matters is small compared to the overall curriculum. & The presentation of problems related to resource management seems to be solely theoretical, explanatory and informative. & There is little concern for the study of the local environment and teachers are ignorant of innovative teaching methods because they lack training and professionalism. In the Michoaca´nMichoaca´n rural setting the situation is made even worse by huge educational deficiencies that have given rise to high levels of ignorance and illiteracy among the population, leading in turn, to the inadequate use of forest resources and hence, environmental degradation . These shortcomings stand in the way of establishing productive linkages between schools and the local natural, social and cultural conditions of Michoaca´nMichoaca´n forest community children and young people (Centro de estudios para el desarrollo rural 1998). Despite these shortcomings, schools have the wherewithal to introduce participative projects (Pareánd Lazos 2003) that could connect pupils to their parents and the community at large and also to their forest resources managers. This educational process will have to be from the bottom up so as to convey the concerns, ideas and concepts of adults as to what is needed to conserve the forests where they work. In turn, revisiting the teacher–pupil relationship implies recognition that pupils' experience as well as those of their parents and the wider community inform the cultural narratives of who one is, what one is and where one is (Centro de estudios para el desarrollo rural 1998). It is essential to work on and strengthen personal identity in rural schools, especially in high school, since this is the highest level of formal education in these communities. It is thus necessary to establish whether high school curricula and syllabuses are linked to the forest management activities carried out by these communities. It is also necessary to ascertain whether the knowledge and opinions of adults on their work in the community forest enterprises are being handed down to young people. To achieve this, educational policies committed to rehabilitating, training and instilling environmental values and practices in the young population are needed to help build processes of local sustainability. The complexity of the social, economic and political aspects of these issues calls for initiatives based on education for sustainability and rooted in the analysis of specific contexts (). This piece of research looks at the indigenous community of San Juan Nuevo Parangaricutiro in Michoaca´nMichoaca´n, which is one of the state and national community forestry success stories since the consolidation of its community forest enterprise in 1981. The forest is managed according to a forest management plan based on a complex social and ecological system comprising a host of social, institutional, political and economic interacting actors. Furthermore, it has won international recognition for the sustainable management of their forest asset. The success achieved is such that this community knowledge on conservation and exploitation practices must be handed down from generation to generation. What adolescents can learn about environmental issues is closely predicated on the teaching methods used in school and by the parents who work for the forest enterprise and the broader community (Barraza 2003 ). Nonetheless, successful community forest policies are not being factored into the curricula designed for community young people. In this research project, the influence of high-school education, the home and the San Juan Nuevo forest enterprise as centres of teaching and learning on young people in the community was analysed. A study was made of the relationship dynamics and the contents of their formal and non-formal education systems in terms of the knowledge and attitudes of adolescents towards communal forest management . From the results, specific proposals intended to enrich the environmental and local content of the high-school curriculum emerged through a participative process involving young people, community representatives and the education authorities.","aid":null}

Since 1998, more than 50 natural resource management institutions, known as conservancies, have been established in order to manage wildlife resources, on communal lands in Namibia. The national programme is often cited as a CBNRM success; however, despite its rapid spread, there are few systematically collected or analysed household-level data which demonstrate the long-term ecological, social and economic impacts of Namibian programme. A meta-synthesis was undertaken to determine the range of positive and negative livelihood impacts resulting from CBNRM programme activities in two key regions, and the factors affecting how these impacts have been felt by households or individuals. Impacts were categorized according to any changes in access to and/or returns from the five key assets of the sustainable livelihoods framework, namely financial, human, natural, physical and social assets. Positive and negative impacts were felt on financial, human, natural and social assets; only positive impacts were identified as affecting physical assets. Individual-and household-level impacts differed depending on the specific activities implemented locally and, according to the duration, frequency and timing of the impacts, the circumstances and preferences of households and their access to particular activities and consequent impacts. If a greater understanding of the extent and importance of different impacts is to be gained in the future, more rigorous and comprehensive data collection and analysis will need to be undertaken.

L. and Coomes O. T.","dAbstract":"Keywords Amazonia, asset poverty, forest product extraction, peasantry, Peru, rain forest conservation, ribereñosribere˜ribereños, traditional agriculture Amazon rain forests are perhaps the most renowned of the diverse ecosystems around the globe where conservation and development initiatives are being implemented with the dual aim of helping local people and protecting biodiversity. Such initiatives are typically sponsored by international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who work with rural people and local organizations to develop strategies for more effective resource management, such as establishing extractive reserves, promoting new commercial rain forest products and services (including ecotourism), and implementing community-based conservation and development schemes (Assies 1997; Clay and Clement 1993; Fearnside 1989; Plotkin and Famolare 1992). Elsewhere, Coomes and Barham (1997) argued that these initiatives are likely to founder because prevailing conceptions of rain forest peoples and their livelihood practices do not explicitly incorporate the heterogeneity of geographic and economic conditions, and how these factors shape local resource-use decisions. 1 Failure to understand the basic logic of forest peoples' livelihood practices limits the ability of NGOs to develop appropriate strategies and institutional arrangements for local management, and thereby reduces the likelihood that conservation and development initiatives will achieve their desired goals. The challenge of understanding livelihood strategies in humid tropical forests is considerable, even daunting, as the rich array of natural resources in such biodiverse environments gives rise to a wide array of economic opportunities and activities. Indeed, households living in tropical forests are typically active not only in agriculture , but also in shing, aquatic extraction, hunting, forest-product gathering, and/or logging. Hence, we often use the term \" forest peasant households \" in our work to describe these forest peoples (Barham et al. 1999; Takasaki et al. 2000a). The resulting mix of activities can be highly diverse; indeed, signi cant heterogeneity in livelihood exists not only across regions and communities, but also within communities and even households over time (Anderson and Ioris 1992; Coomes 1996; Godoy et al. 1995; Gunatilake et al. 1993; Padoch et al. 1999 ). To explicate diversity in peasant livelihoods , we must answer the crucial question of what factors shape resource use at the household level. This article explores the role of wealth and geographical factors in shaping resource use and income generation among forest peasant households, or as they are called locally ribereños, in the Peruvian Amazon. Geographical differences in local endowments of resources (i.e., quantity and quality of land, sheries, forest products, and animals) as well as access to towns and product markets are expected to give rise to distinct economic opportunities and returns, which will be re ected in the activity mix choices. Differences in wealth holdings among peasant households also are likely to condition the mix of activities pursued, because— in the absence of well-functioning credit, land and insurance markets —peasants must self-nance their investments, claim and clear land to secure property, and self-insure their choices, all backed by the household's wealth holdings. 2 Wealth and geographical factors are thus linked in at least two ways. First, local endowments of natural resources strongly condition wealth holding options, accumulation possibilities, and activity choices of forest peasant households. And second, remote locales typically lack complete markets (especially for credit or insurance), which, in turn, makes personal wealth holdings especially important in shaping peasants' activity choices. Downloaded by [UQ Library] at 22:06 21 October 2014 This article provides an empirical analysis of resource use and income among ribereñosribere˜ribereños in Peru's Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve (PSNR), one of the richest zones of biological diversity and largest protected areas in the Amazonian lowlands. Using data gathered during 1996–1997 from ribereño households in the PSNR area, we evaluate how village and household-level variations in wealth portfolios help to explain heterogeneous patterns of resource use and distinct income generation. Our analysis reveals not only the signi cant role of geographical factors and physical wealth in differentiating household resource use and incomes, but also the potential role of human capital—in the form of local knowledge or skill—in speci c types of resource extraction . These results suggest the potential for explaining spatial and social variations in resource use among forest peasant households elsewhere with considerably less effort than typically required in data collection, especially if Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) techniques are re ned to incorporate the lessons generated from this research (Takasaki et al. 2000a). We explore the role of wealth and geographical factors through descriptive statistics that stratify our household data set in two ways. First, we create village groups based on the quantity and quality of local land resources; the ensuing division into \" land-poor, \" \" land-middle, \" and \" land-rich \" villages reveals major across-village differences in wealth portfolios and activity choice. 3 Second, we divide the sample according to relative wealth classes. Of particular interest are two asset categories—land and productive capital—and households are assigned to one of four wealth classes according to their relative holdings of these assets. This approach recognizes that assets are not readily substitutable in this environment (e.g., land holdings cannot be translated easily into a boat, motor, and shing nets even if relative prices suggested the bene t of such a shift), and allows us to avoid the intractable problem of constructing a reliable monetary estimate of the value of land holdings given the absence of land markets and poor land-based yield data. When combined with the village groups, our wealth-class analysis provides a surprisingly clear picture of the role of the key factors that shape activity choices of forest peasant households. This article is organized as follows. The next section describes the study area and livelihood choices facing ribereñoribere˜ribereño households. The third section compares household resource use and income across the village groups. The fourth section then contrasts household holdings of land and nonland assets across villages, and relates them to resource use. The fth section evaluates the wealth-resource use-income relationships across village groups and households using the wealth classes. The sixth section concludes with re ections on how such analyses may serve to further conservation and development efforts of NGOs and other practitioners in tropical forest environments.","aid":null}

K.","dAbstract":"Conflicts between local people and protected area managers are a common problem in developing countries, but in many cases there has been little attempt to comprehensively characterize the underlying problems. Resource uses, management practices, economy and people's perceptions of problems and likely solutions were analysed in two villages near and two villages away from the core zone of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in the Indian Himalaya. Agriculture, although practised on less than 1% of the area, was the primary occupation of local people. Six annual crops of a total of 22 and all four horticultural crops on private farms were damaged by wildlife, but Reserve management provided compensation only for livestock killing by wildlife and compensation amounted to only 4–10% of the total assessed monetary value of killed livestock. A variety of wild plant products were used locally but 27 were marketed by more than 50% of surveyed families ; income from wild products was substantially lower than that from crops and livestock. A sociocul-tural change from a subsistence to a market economy, together with changes in traditional land/resource rights and institutions, has led to a number of changes in land-use and management practices. The livestock population has declined, agricultural area has remained the same and people have started cultivating medicinal species in the last 20 years. These changes seem complementary to the goal of conservation. However, changes such as aban-donment of some traditional food crops and stress on cash crops lacking fodder value, requiring substantial manure inputs derived from forest litter and livestock excreta, and causing severe soil erosion, seem to counter the goal of environmental conservation. Some government-managed Reserve Forest sites were similar to the Community Forests in terms of species richness, basal area and soil physico-chemical properties. Two Reserve Forest sites showed basal areas of 160.5–191.5 m 2 /ha, exceeding the highest values reported so far from the region. The formal institutional framework of resource management seems to be not as effective as the traditional informal system. The Reserve Management Plan lays more emphasis on legal protection than on the sustainable livelihood of local communities and has led to conflicts between local people and reserve managers. Plantation of fodder and medicinal species in degraded forest lands, suppression of economic exploitation of local people in the market, enhancement of local knowledge of the economic potential of biodiversity, incentives for cultivation of crops with comparative advantages and lesser risks of damage by wildlife, and rejuvenation of the traditional involvement of the whole village community in decison-making, could be the options for resolving conflicts between people and protected areas in this case.

The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions. ß","aid":335}

{"filename":"Ezebilo 2010b","year":2010,"title":"Conservation of a leafy vegetable important for communities in the Nigerian rainforest","authors":"Ezebilo E. E.","dAbstract":"1. Introduction In most developing countries non-timber forest products such as game meat, mushrooms, berries and medicinal plants contribute to livelihood of people who reside in rural areas (Osemeobo and Ujor, 1999). These products serve as food, source of income and medicinal care. For example, Gnetum africanum Welw contributes to the livelihood of most forest dependent communities in West Africa (Ndoye et al., 1998). It is locally called afang and ukasi in Nigeria, in the Cameroon it is known as eru and okoko (Shiembo, 1994). In the Central African Republic, Gabon and Democratic Republic of Congo G. africanum Welw is called koko (Bahuchet, 1990). G. africanum Welw is a dioecious forest perennial liana up to 10 m long but sometime longer, branches somewhat thickened at the nodes, glabrous. This plant is native in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Nigeria. G. africanum Welw (afang) is one of the most popular green leafy vegetable in Nigeria (Ekop, 2007). It grows as a wild evergreen climbing plant in the tropical rainforest of Nigeria. The leaves are either eaten raw or are finely shredded and added to soups and stews (Burkill, 1994). The afang leaves are rich in protein and it contains eight essential amino acids (Mialoundama, 1993). Therefore afang leaves have the potential to contribute to the protein requirements of rural dwellers. The afang leaf and seed have medicinal uses such as treatment of enlarged spleen, sore throats, and management of excessive urination in infantile diabetic patients (Mialoundama, 1993; Okafor, 2003; Smith, 1983; Shiembo, 1994). The afang leaves are traded in local and regional markets in West and Central Africa and also exported to Europe and North America, respectively. This suggests that the afang leaves may contribute to the livelihood of many people and it may play important role in the alleviation of poverty. Though the afang plant contributes to the livelihood of most communities in south-eastern Nigeria, there is no tradition amongst the people to cultivate it. The afang leaves is often harvested from natural forest. This may cause risk of driving it to extinction because, afang leaves are harvested in enormous quantities to maximise benefit. Unsustainable harvesting technique is often used during the extraction of the afang leaves. For example, the trees which the afang vine climbs are felled and the afang plant uprooted. This has negative impacts on natural regeneration of the afang plant and it contributes to deforestation. Most forest dependent communities in south-eastern Nigeria often depend on the afang leaves to supplement for the income from farming. Income from the afang leaves help to sustain the people during cropping season when there is little or no income from farming. Therefore extinction of the afang will have negative implications on food security of the people. In order to minimise the risk of extinction of the afang plant, there has to be a balance between use of this resource and its conservation. In this way the afang plant will contribute to the food security of the people, as well as perform vital environmental functions. This will give the rural poor the opportunity to have access to sustainable livelihood. Conservation of the afang plant will sustain the afang trade, ensure Forest Ecology and Management 259 (2010) 1660–1665 A R T I C L E I N F O Article history: Keywords: Willingness-to-conserve Sustainable Nigeria A B S T R A C T Adoption and implementation of sustainable biodiversity conservation are essential for sustaining protected areas. But development of effective strategies to achieve them is problematic. This is often because of limited knowledge about the impact of biodiversity conservation policies on livelihood of indigenous people. This study uses dichotomous choice format to examine willingness to engage in the conservation of an indigenous leafy vegetable – Gnetum africanum Welw. The empirical data were generated from three communities in the vicinity of the Okwangwo Division of the Cross River National Park, Nigeria. The data were analyzed with the aid of the binary logit model. The study showed that the respondents' mean willingness to pay per year to conserve the leafy vegetable was 7% of their income from non-timber forest products. The decision to conserve the leafy vegetable was influenced by factors such as cost associated with conservation, income from non-timber forest products, the distance of the respondent's residence to the Okwangwo Division, education and occupation. ß 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. the flow of benefits to the rural poor, and subsequently reduce the pressure on the afang wild population. The value of the afang plant is a reflection of its meaning to the society where it is found, its value today arises from the future value. If individual's perceptions of future value of the afang is high, it will most likely be conserved, i.e. the individual's option value for the plant is positive, suggesting that he/she would be willing to conserve the afang for its use in the future. The economic value for the conservation of the afang plant cannot be observed in the market. This can be estimated using non-market valuation methods such as contingent valuation (Boyle and Bishop, 1987; Carson, 2004; Rubin et al., 1991; Garrod and Willis, 1999; Champ et al., 2003; Carson et al., 1996). The contingent valuation method is a survey-based economic technique which typically asks how much people would be willing to pay or willing to accept compensation to maintain the existence of environmental feature, e.g. biodiversity. Individuals may be willing to pay for non-use environmental benefits. However, these benefits are likely to be implicitly treated as zero unless their monetary value is estimated. Since people do not reveal their willingness to pay for non-use environmental benefits (e.g. biodiversity conservation) through their purchases, the option for estimating this value may be by asking them how much they would be willing to pay. The loss of tropical rainforest is a cause of global concern. Various initiatives have been undertaken at national and international level to reduce deforestation of the tropical rainforest . One of these initiatives is the establishment of protected areas. More than 19.6 million km 2 (11.5%) of the land surface of the earth are protected (World Database on Protected Areas, 2005). This strategy has been fairly successful in developed countries, but has not been very successful in developing countries (Dixon and Sherman, 1990). Inadequate linkages between local communities and conservation efforts undertaken in the protected areas often risk to achieving the conservation objective (Ezebilo and Mattsson, 2009, in press). The cooperation of local communities is needed for successful conservation in protected areas because activities of the people often have effects on the conservation goals. Therefore, it is important to have knowledge about biodiversity conservation strategies which may be more appropriate for developing countries. This will help policy-makers with regards to decisions concerning how to package conservation project to make it more sustainable. It is considered that if individuals have continuous access to the afang plant on their land they may not have the incentive to extend the afang leaves extracting activities to protected areas. With focus on the conservation of afang on private lands in communities around the buffer zone of the Okwangwo Division of the Cross River National Park. The aim of this study is to examine community's decision to conserve the afang plant and how it is influenced by socio-economic factors.

Then followed by the results and discussion, and the final section is devoted to the conclusion.","aid":null}

Even though participatory research is considered a strategy to facilitate co-management, there is little empirical evidence supporting this. The objective of the present paper is to analyze the contributions of partici-patory research to help encourage the emergence of co-management, based on a case study in Piriápolis artisanal fishery in coastal Uruguay (where management has been topedown). We argue that partici-patory research involving artisanal fishers, government, and other stakeholders (university scientists and NGOs) can be a key stimulus towards co-management. We build this argument by considering \" seven faces \" by which co-management can be analyzed: (1) as power sharing; (2) as institution building; (3) as trust building; (4) as process; (5) as learning and knowledge co-production; (6) as problem solving; and (7) as governance. Our findings show that participatory research had an impact on these various faces: (1) power was shared when making research decisions; (2) a multi-stakeholder group (POPA), with a common vision and goals, was created; (3) trust among participants increased; (4) the process of group formation was valued by participants; (5) stakeholders learned skills for participation; (6) two problem-solving exercises were conducted; and (7) a diversity of stakeholders of the initial problem identified by fishers (sea lions' impact on long-line fishery) participated in the process. The case shows that partici-patory research functions as a platform which enhances learning and knowledge co-production among stakeholders, paving the way towards future co-management.","aid":null}

This article presents the socioeconomic baselines and synthetic measures of recreational fishers' social acceptance. Recreational boat fishers' perceptions toward the NMR, current strategies, and territorial stakes were identified through fifty interviews. This led to five synthetic measures of social acceptance and the differentiation of five different groups of recreational fishers in terms of their uses opinions. The five groups of recreational fishers differed considerably in regards to three key aspects of social acceptance. However, local geography played little role in social acceptance, with views being relatively uniform across the three main ports.","aid":null}

M. and Van Beukering P. and Sanjayan M.","dAbstract":"We assessed a donor-funded grassland management project designed to create both conservation and livelihood benefits in the rangelands of Mongolia's Gobi desert. The project ran from 1995 to 2006, and we used remote sensing Normalized Differential Vegetation Index data from 1982 to 2009 to compare project grazing sites to matched control sites before and after the project's implementation. We found that the productivity of project grazing sites was on average within 1% of control sites for the 20 years before the project but generated 11% more biomass on average than the control areas from 2000 to 2009. To better understand the benefits of the improved grasslands to local people, we conducted 280 household interviews, 8 focus group discussions, and 31 key informant interviews across 6 districts. We found a 12% greater median annual income as well as a range of other socioeconomic benefits for project households compared to control households in the same areas. Overall, the project generated measurable benefits to both nature and people. The key factors underlying project achievements that may be replicable by other conservation projects include the community-driven approach of the project, knowledge exchanges within and between communities inside and outside the country, a project-supported local community organizer in each district, and strong community leadership.","aid":null}
