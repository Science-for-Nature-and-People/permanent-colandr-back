Despite the availability of technologies to control broomrapes in economically important crops, Orobanche infestation continues to increase, threatening the livelihoods of millions of farmers. Many of the technologies developed have not been effectively disseminated and there has been little or zero adoption by farmers-who continue to use ineffective management practices that exacerbate the problem. The adaptation and dissemination of appropriate management practices are major priorities in broomrape control. However, such work must take into consideration the specific socio-economic characteristics of individual farming systems. Orobanche is a community threat and effective management requires a community-based integrated management approach. Recognizing the central role of farmers in parasitic weed management, a technical cooperation project (TCP) involving FAO, ICARDA and seven countries in the Near East and North Africa (NENA) region was implemented to improve the dissemination of knowledge and skills by using a farmer field school approach: a form of education that uses experiential learning methods to build farmers' expertise. This paper reviews conventional Orobanche research and development approaches, and highlights weaknesses in the management of the parasitic weed using these approaches as opposed to participatory approaches. The benefits and challenges of participatory farming system approaches in relation to integrated broomrape management (IBM) are also discussed. Lessons learned from achieving community ownership of, and institutional support for, IBM could be applied to other sectors (e.g. public health) in which there is a need for institutional learning and reform. Recommendations are made that include regional collaboration within the framework of a proposed Near East and North Africa Orobanche Management Network (NENAOMAN). Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We suggest that both approaches have potential application to common-pool resources such as floodplain fisheries. However, a merging of transboundary and community-based management may reinforce oversimplifications about heterogeneity in resources, users, and institutions. A scalar mismatch between the ecosystem of concern in transboundary management and local resources of concern in community-based management, as well as different colonial and post-colonial histories contribute to this heterogeneity. We describe a fishery shared by Namibia and Zambia in terms of hybrid fisheries management. We examine settlement patterns, fishermen characteristics, sources of conflict, and perceptions regarding present and potential forms of fisheries management in the area. We also consider the implications that initiatives to manage resources on the local and ecosystem scale have for these fishing livelihoods. Our findings indicate that important social factors, such as the unequal distribution of population and fishing effort, as well as mixed opinions regarding present and future responsibility for fisheries management will complicate attempts to implement a hybrid community-transboundary management initiative.

This paper investigates Malaysian Orang Asli's dependency on forest resources using a forest management unit (FMU) in the state of Johor, Malaysia, as a case study. The study used both survey questionnaire and field observations to collect data and information on the Orang Asli depencency on forest resources. Valuation of resources accrued to the Orang Asli communities in the study area was also investigated. The result disclosed that forest in the state still provides opportunities to the Orang Asli communities to support their livelihoods in the forms of tangible and intangible benefits. In particular, the tangible benefits accrued to them have resulted in hundreds of millions of ringgit in use value.

Government officials, forest users and development workers are all involved in shaping policy for the management of forest for biodiversity and other values. It is therefore crucial to understand the different viewpoints about biodiversity among these stakeholders. This paper is derived from a broad case study on the views of various stakeholders in community forestry in Nepal, but is focused on understanding the views of policy-level government officials in regards to biodiversity conservation. Using a grounded theory approach, qualitative data were collected on two field visits in 2002-2003 to the study area. The results of interviews with officials indicate diverse perspectives in interpreting biodiversity conservation. These include perceptions of forest users' understanding about diversity, and strong beliefs about definition of biodiversity and about dependence of users on forest for their livelihood. Implications of the results include an obvious need for better understanding by staff at various levels of government and other agencies involved in community forestry, of the different concepts and views held about biodiversity conservation. A broader understanding among officials of biodiversity and deeper knowledge of other's views on biodiversity conservation could help in designing and implementing policies and programs in the context of community forest management.","journal":"Forestry Chronicle","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

However, the potential of NTFPs to contribute to development remained limited and open to doubt. The study objectives were to: (i) analyze the role of NTFPs livelihood strategies in rural development in order to explain their potentials and failures; and (ii) identify and analyze the factors influencing the contribution of NTFPs livelihood strategies to household income. The study was carried out analyzing three NTFPs in Rashad locality in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan in 2008-2009. The data were collected through interviews, direct observations and market surveys. Purposive sampling technique was applied to select 221 and 62 collector and trader households, respectively. The results revealed that Adansonia digitata fruit sale represents a subsistence strategy for some sampled households and accumulative strategy for others, while Ziziphus spina-christi and Balanites aegyptiaca fruits sale is a subsistence strategy for all the surveyed households. The study results also showed that the income from selling the fruits was positively and negatively influenced by different external and internal factors. The study concluded that any assumption regarding the potential of NTFPs to positively affect rural development depends on their role in an accumulative strategy that lifts people out of poverty. Institutional, technical and financial supports are necessary to influence the future direction of the NTFP contribution toward accumulative strategy. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This has led to the formulation of several conceptual approaches for planning and analysing development issues. One of such approaches in recent times is the sustainable livelihood approach. This approach considers that for development to be enduring, it should be people centred, non-sectoral and based on the multi-dimensional reality of the multiple problems faced by people in their daily efforts at achieving a satisfactory living given the complex social and institutional environment in which they operate the approach is considered as newly evolving and, as such, one in which new discoveries are possible.

It is obvious that most of rural development strategies ever introduced by successive governments in the country have failed to achieve the goal of transforming rural economy. For instance, community development, integrated rural development, mobilization, river basin development and creation of more local governments just to mention a few of them. The notion of agricultural tourism is now gaining ground all over the world as a means of boosting rural economic development. The objective of the study was to assess the facilities, training needs and future challenges of the tourism industry. The administration of questionnaire and conduct of oral interview constitute major research instrument for the study. A total of 60 samples were selected through a purposive sampling technique. In addition, focus group discussion was conducted among the members of the community in order to collect relevant data. Regarding analytical technique, descriptive statistics such as calculating the mean, averages and percentages was adopted for the study. It was revealed that there were facilities such as lodging (91.6%), visitations (71.6%), offices (78.3%), fish ponds (86.7%), poultry farm (66.6%), zoo (58.3%) and restaurant (60.0%) were available at the centre. In addition, the respondents identified areas of training needs such as environmental management with a mean score (2.75), water management (2.70), fruit conservation (2.56), nursery production (2.50) and entrepreneurial skill (2.47). The future prospects revealed that increased income with a mean score (2.83) top the list, followed by the growth of small-scale industry and better health environment have equal mean score (2.71), promotion of fresh farm products (2.66) and beautification of the environment (2.56) in that order. The constraints to establishing agricultural tourism were identified such as inaccessibility to credit facility (2.85), limited visitors (2.73), and inadequate appropriate technology to develop it (2.65). On the basis of the findings, one recommends that increased awareness should be raised towards developing agricultural tourism, creating enabling environment that facilitates accessibility to credit facilities without tears and moreover, agricultural tourism could be adopted as a rural development strategy in this country.

The study used a combination of data collection approaches including a questionnaire survey, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, field observation and measurements and collection of market prices. The results show that the contribution of the wetland to the livelihoods of the local community is an estimated annual $228 per household, which represents about 15% of the average 2006 household income of $1584/year. Crop production contributed the highest gross value, while sedge collection yielded the highest cash income. Overall, an annual gross value of $900/ha is provided through provisioning services in the Ga-Mampa wetland. In addition, it was found that wetland services are essential for household subsistence and providing resources for gift giving to neighbours and relatives. Due to the lack of alternative income sources, the declining income from sedge and reed harvesting caused by continued degradation of the wetland poses considerable economic hardship. Integrated assessment of all ecosystem services and identification of involved stakeholders is needed to develop sustainable management strategies that deal with the environmental and socio-economic changes in the area.

Lake Chad was formerly the sixth largest Lake and second largest in the World and Africa respectively, the size of the Lake has drastically reduced. As part of the restoration processes, water quality has been an aspect under consideration in the improvement of the Lake Chad. The research projects tend to determine the attitude and expectation of the communals living along the Lake Chad Shore, in terms of water resources management. In this survey, three communities were choosen-namely Baga (Nigeria), Bol (Chad Republic) and N'guigmi (Niger). N'guigmi, the community was excluded from the survey from the fact that it has suffered from severe drought in the past nine years. In Baga and Bol communities, 30 respondents were selected randomly. Structured- and unstructured questionnaires were administered. Results indcates that, the proportion of male respondents outnumber the female respondents, this is due to cultural barrier. On the recent Oil exploration development in the Lake Chad Basin, the proportion of respondents who are supportative in the Oil exploration is 53.3% and 10.0% in Baga and Bol respectively. In comparison, to the proportion of respondents who are unsupportive to the exploration is 13.3% and 23.3% in Baga and Bol respectively. In the water resources management of the Lake Chad, survey shows that 16.7% and 30.0% of the respondents treat their drinking water in Baga and Bol communities respectively while 53.3% and 60.0% untreat their drinking water in Baga and Bol communities.

This study aims to investigate how farmers affected by community forestry have adapted to its introduction and whether their livelihood options have changed in response to changes in forest accessibility and forest product availability. A total of 309 households were interviewed in eight forest user groups in the middle hills of Nepal and results on reported changes in forest product collection and livestock numbers analysed. Reported forest product collection has increased since the introduction of community forestry, while livestock numbers have decreased. The main findings of the study are that, despite controlled access to the forest, collection rates have increased slightly in the majority of income groups and households. The number of trees on private land has increased, while the size of livestock herds has decreased. As long as the farmers can continue to adapt without adversely affecting their livelihoods they will support this forestry management system leading to an increased chance of the long term success of common property forest management in Nepal.

In Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) buffer zone, Nepal, farmers' perceptions were used to evaluate how irrigation resource development and the method of water sharing have increased household food security and reduced pressure on natural resources of the park. The findings indicate that with some variations between communities, increased water availability and reliability through irrigation development have improved crop diversity, cropping intensity, food sufficiency, and economic return to farmers. Community attributes such as leadership and dynamics were, among others, the decisive factors that determined the degree of success of the government development intervention programme in the buffer zone. Small landholders and low-income groups in dry areas perceived that they received greater benefits from micro-groundwater pumping schemes. However, many rural poor inhabitants in the area still lack access to these resource opportunities. We observed that Park and People, a government programme, successfully improved public relations and helped create awareness in this buffer zone. However, grievances persist among other water user groups in the upstream part of the Rapti River where a water-sharing mechanism needs to be defined between water user associations for crop production and maintenance of biodiversity of the national park.

Whilst the primary focus was on interactions between tourism and climate change, the study revealed a highly complex system, with many social, economic, environmental, and institutional drivers involved. In order to bring some clarity and consistency in the exploration of these complex interactions in context, elements of the policy sciences, primarily problem orientation, were utilised. The exploratory nature of the study, including its objectives and intended use, meant that goal clarification and analyses of trends were based on limited available information. Despite these shortcomings, the study was able to elucidate and clarify on important factors to consider in consultation with relevant participants. Diversification of livelihood options as well as preserving local culture were found to be highly valued-both by the local communities that were consulted as well as for those advocating for a tourism experience that is unique to this region. Harmonising these valued outcomes could be achieved by incorporating and legitimising local traditional knowledge. Insights into further collaboration on the issue of valued outcomes would strengthen and support the knowledge base for an appraisal of possible development pathways.

Using Participatory Research Appraisal (PRA) tools and techniques, 55 villages randomly selected in the two production zones of Togo were surveyed to document the ethnobotanical and indigenous knowledge related to its production, diversity, use and conservation. For all of the ethnic groups involved in fonio production in Togo (Akposso and AkÃ©bou in the south; Losso-Nawda, Lamba, Tamberma, Tchokossi and Gangan in the north), the crop has a high sociocultural value. The fonio genetic diversity being managed by the farmers seems important as 42 landraces were recorded. Two lines of origin that contributed to this current genetic diversity (local domestication or introduction from neighbouring countries) were reported by the farmers. Cooking qualities, growth cycle, colour and size of the grains are the main criteria used by farmers to describe varieties. According to farmers, fonio production and diversity are being regressing because of several constraints of which the most important are lack of adequate harvest, threshing and processing technologies and development of pests and diseases. The important ethnobotanical and indigenous data recorded will be useful in accessing the genetic diversity of the crop in Togo and in defining appropriate strategies for its conservation on farm.

Fifty-two households from 4 villages were interviewied inNajjembe sub-county in Mukono district that surrounding Mabira Forest Reserve. Questions were pre-determined and interviews guided. Individuals were interviewied for about 30-60 min. Primary data were subjected to content analysis, coded and subsequently analysed using Statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS). About 78% of the respondents were aware of the current Forest Policy in Uganda. About 59% of the respondents said that utilization and socio-economic benefits is strongly supported by the Forest Policy. Half of the respondents disagree that local people have more access to forest products than before under the current Forest Policy. About the same number of the respondents disagree that the forest and tree cover has increased under the present Forest Policy. Capacity to manage forest resources by local communities was weak, majority of the respondents said that none of their household members had received any of training in natural and or plantation forest management. Many institutions including National Forestry Authority (NFA), National Environment Management Authority, Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), Local Governments and Civil Society Organizations were reportedly playing key roles in conservation and management of the forest.

The potential role of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in improving nutrition and health and reduction of poverty has been recognized in recent years. NTFPs continue to be an important source of household food security, nutrition, and health. Despite their significant contribution to food security, nutrition, and sustainable livelihoods, these tend to be overlooked by policy-makers. NTFPs have not been accorded adequate attention in development planning and in nutrition-improvement programmes in Ghana. Using exploratory and participatory research methods, this study identified the potentials of NTFPs in improving nutrition and food security in the country. Data collected from the survey were analyzed using the SPSS software (version 16.0). Pearson's correlation (p<0.05) showed that a significant association exists between NTFPs and household food security, nutrition, and income among the populations of Bibiani-Bekwai and Sefwi Wiawso districts in the western region of Ghana. NTFPs contributed significantly to nutrition and health of the poor in the two districts, especially during the lean seasons. The results of the survey also indicated that 90% of the sampled population used plant medicine to cure various ailments, including malaria, typhoid, fever, diarrhoea, arthritis, rheumatism, and snake-bite. However, a number of factors, including policy vacuum, increased overharvesting of NTFPs, destruction of natural habitats, bushfires, poor farming practices, population growth, and market demand, are hindering the use and development of NTFPs in Ghana. The study also provides relevant information that policy-makers and development actors require for improving nutrition and health in Ghana.

Increased attention in recent years has been focused on the potential role of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in improving the incomes and health of women in developing countries. NTFPs farming and marketing are very critical for the economic empowerment of rural poor, particularly women. Despite this potential, the contribution of NTFPs farming to the empowerment of women remains largely undervalued and understudied. This paper examines the potential contribution of NTFPs farming in poverty reduction and livelihood improvement of women in Ghana using the Sefwi Wiawso District (SWD) and Bibiani-Bekwai District (BBD) in the Western Region of Ghana as a case study. The paper explores the contribution of NTFPs farming to the total annual income, acquisition of assets, health, and food security of women through participatory research methods. ANOVA and Pearson Correlation (p < 0.05) show that a significant association exists between total annual income of women, acquisition of assets, health, food security, and the income earned from NTFPs in the SWD and BBD. The study revealed that NTFPs can contribute significantly to the economic empowerment of women. The paper asserts that commercialisation of NTFPs will have a greater impact on women's livelihoods and therefore any opportunity for increasing their involvement is very essential for the empowerment and sustainable development of rural communities in Ghana.

Kuntze Theaceae in an indigenous Akha (Hani) community in the midlevel montane forests of southwest Yunnan, China. Surveys were conducted in 2005 and 2008, over a period corresponding to a regional tea market boom and bust cycle, to compare the valuation smallholders attribute to land use types and to determine the role that value systems play in shaping environmental behavior and knowledge. At the community level, increased market integration of tea agroforests is associated with reconfiguration of land use, intensified management, reorganization of labor structures, and generation of knowledge on tea resources. Akha have tapped into customary resources and forged new social networks with tea industry agents to take advantage of emerging market opportunities. They have resisted state reforms calling for the cultivation of high-intensity plantations and introduced cultivars. Consequently, they have benefited from price premiums through niche market networks for tea sourced from agroforests and proprietary landraces not available to other communities disempowered by market cycles. Subsistence agriculture, home gardening, and foraging persist for food security despite tea wealth. However, as traditional values are reoriented toward market-based ideologies, the community may risk a breakdown of the social institutions that support sustainability.

Some success stories have been recorded (e.g. nitrogen-fixing legumes), but the adoption of RSFR technologies has generally lagged behind scientific advances thereby reducing the potential impacts of the technologies. This paper describes the major RSFR technologies being promoted in the region, synthesizes available information regarding their adoption by farmers, and identifies the challenges, key lessons learnt and the way forward for up-scaling RSFR technologies in the region. The review indicated that farmer uptake of RSFR technologies depends on several factors that can be grouped into broad categories: Technology-specific (e.g. soil type, management regime), household-specific (e.g. farmer perceptions, resource endowment, household size), policy and institutions context within which RSFR is disseminated (inputs and output prices, land tenure and property rights), and geo-spatial (performance of species across different bio-physical conditions, location of village). Adoption of RSFR technologies can be enhanced by targeting them to their biophysical and social niches, facilitating appropriate policy and institutional contexts for dissemination, understanding the broader context and dynamics of the adoption process, a paradigm shift in the approach to the dissemination of RSFR (e.g. expanding RSFR to high value crop systems, exploring synergy with inorganic fertilizer) and, targeted incentive systems that encourage farmers to take cognizance of natural resource implications when making agricultural production decisions.

This study used a multiple visit cost-route method to estimate labour inputs and financial profitability of agroforestry-based and conventional (with and without fertiliser) soil fertility management practices in eastern Zambia. Results show that aggregated over a five-year cycle, labour inputs used under agroforestry practices were lower than fertilised maize fields but higher than non-fertilised continuous cropped maize. Agroforestry practices were more profitable (NPV ranging between $233 and $327 ha-1) than unfertilised maize fields (NPV of $130 ha-1) but less profitable than fertilised maize fields. The NPV for the latter is $499 ha-1 under a 50% government subsidy on fertiliser but, it fell to $349 ha-1 when the subsidy effect is removed. In terms of return per unit investment cost, agroforestry practices performed better with a benefit to cost ratio ranging between 2.77 to 3.13 in contrast to 2.65 (subsidised fertiliser) and 1.77 (non-subsidised fertiliser). The returns to labour per person day was $2.56 in (non-subsidised) fertilised maize field, $3.16 in subsidised fertiliser field, $2.63 in Gliricidia fields, $2.41 in Sesbania fields, $1.90 in Tephrosia fields, and $1.10 in non-fertilised maize fields. The results do not support the popular notion that agroforestry practices are more labour intensive. It suggests that in addition to total labour use requirements, the temporal distribution of labour use during the farming season is important. It is concluded that agroforestry practices are profitable, and could contribute to food security.","journal":"Agrekon","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Using a sample of 182 respondents around the Kakum National Park in Ghana's Central Region, an area which is rich in tourism assets but economically poor, it examines residents' expectations, experiences and perceptions about tourism development in the area. While some expectations were too much, others had been met, if only somewhat. Residents' experiences in terms of direct socio-economic benefits were modest. But largely on account of indirect gains from a range of propoor interventions, the majority had a fairly positive perception of tourism in the area. Respondents of communities beyond the Park's reception area had gained more from associated interventions rather than from tourism. Age and place of birth were also found to be key variables that influenced residents' perspectives on tourism development in the area. Nevertheless, residents' overall perception suggests that sustainable tourism development requires an approach that simultaneously improves the tourism product and enhances residents' livelihood options. The need for residents to be involved in decision-making if pro-poor tourism is to be successful was underlined.

In rural Sri Lanka, the management of available water resources needs special attention because investment for water resource improvement is hard to obtain, and water itself is relatively scarce in the drier areas of the country. The Wanaraniya Water Project pipes water 6.5km from its source to individual houses in the village, saving women daily time and effort. The project is founded on commitments to community participation and the adoption of local knowledge. It was initiated by women, and has been operated and managed by them for the last six years. This study argues that the project can serve as a model for better planning of water management, and focuses on the unique strategies and innovative methods that have been used. In particular, it shows the impact of involvement in the project on women's empowerment. The implementation of the project has helped women to improve their leadership qualities, confidence, self-reliance, and gain more power in the community through their successful establishment of a village water supply.

The literature has shown that an efficient and effective coastal management program can be instrumental in approaching this problem. In order to secure food and livelihood of fishers, the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center/Aquaculture Department collaborated with the local government of Anini-y, Antique to develop a sustainable utilization of natural marine resources through sea ranching of abalone within the Nogas Island marine protected area. Establishing a marine protected area is a means of conserving natural stocks while sea ranching is considered an effective strategy that can increase fishery resources. The two management schemes are considered as effective coastal resources management strategies. The success of a sea-ranching project is dependent not only on biophysical but also on socioeconomic factors as determinants of community participation and cooperation. A social assessment was conducted to determine the fishers' socio-cultural characteristics, their perceptions of their coastal resources and knowledge on how to effectively manage these coastal resources. The fishers' awareness on fishing regulations and the extent of their participation in community's coastal resources management activities were also determined. Data were collected from a household survey using a semi-structured questionnaire, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with key informants. The fishers generally scored low in almost all aspects of their socioeconomic wellbeing. Most fishers perceived that their coastal resources were in a bad condition which they attributed to illegal and commercial fishing, increasing number of fishers and the poor enforcement of fishery regulations. However, the weighted mean scores of their knowledge on coastal resources management, awareness to fishery regulations and participation in community coastal resource management activities were average. This implied that fishers when trained and developed can become potential partners for effective coastal resources management programs.

These forest reforms seek to initiate the process of eliminating the main causes of forest depletion through participation of local communities. Nevertheless, despite decades of the donor's interventions the deforestation rate in NWFP is still alarming. In this paper we have attempted to analyze the participatory forest management in Northwest Pakistan through livelihood lenses. More specifically this paper explores the impact of joint forest management initiatives on financial assets and livelihood strategies of local people. The overall results indicated that majority of the respondents were not dependent on the natural resources for their cash income rather they had adopted diverse non-natural resource based activities such as migration, labour etc. The results also indicated that the main priorities of the local people were financial and food security; where as the NWFP model of joint forest management gives more emphasis on forest protection and regeneration. Although the joint forest management enhanced the social assets of the local communities yet the omission of immediate financial benefits from the institutional changes in the forestry sector of NWFP was a barrier in motivating the local people in forest protection and was one of the main issues hindering the effectiveness of the forest reforms process.

In 1996 the Asian Development Bank funded the Forestry Sector Project (FSP) in NWFP, which has institutionalized the participatory forest management system in the province. Forests are important natural capital and an essential part of the daily lives of the people who live in and around them. It was therefore considered imperative to analyze the impact of the participatory forest management model introduced by the FSP through a livelihoods lens, and to assess the contribution to livelihood sustainability made by the participatory approach. The findings of the study may be applied to similar situations in Third World settings. People of similar socio-economic and ecological zones may learn lessons for accelerating the process of sustainable natural resource management in their areas. The results showed that the participatory forest management system introduced by the FSP has had a definite impact on increasing the natural and social assets of forest dwellers and reducing vulnerability to their livelihoods. But the project did not address most of the factors of vulnerability and the elites that dominated the newly created institutions. It is suggested that the available livelihood assets, diverse factors of vulnerability and livelihood strategies of the local communities should be analyzed before the implementation of such mega-projects.","journal":"International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

In case the benefit loss that happens by reason of the prohibitions and limitations that are brought related to the usage of the resource is not corrected and local awareness is not created; negative local perceptions can come out pertinent to this resource and in connection with this, hostile attitudes arise related to the resource that is taken under protection. This case is a significant obstacle in front of being able to provide local participation for resource management. In this study the factors that negatively or positively affected the formation of the perceptions of the local people related to the protected areas are studied with the example of Kovada Lake National Park (KLNP). According to the findings of the study, while 25% of the local people have a positive perception on Kovada Lake National Park, the rest has a negative perception. Statistically significant differences have been found between these two groups whose perceptions show differences in terms of the knowledge levels related to the National Park and some losses of benefit that they had for benefiting from it.","journal":"Journal of Environmental Engineering and Landscape Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

However, local people live within and adjacent to the forest resources and are dependent on the forest in terms of their livelihoods may prevent turning some decisions, intended as a component of sustainable forest management, into action. This situation arises from the lack of involvement by local stakeholders, a condition that is generally accepted as one of the most important instruments of sustainable forest management. Consequently, forest and other natural resources have not been effectively protected from negative behaviours of local populations. In this study, difficulties that have been faced in acquiring local participation and the importance of local participation for sustainable forest management are discussed using two case studies from Turkey. At acquiring of local participation is considered to important of local perceptions. If perceptions are negative, participation will not obtain. Thus, the study has focused on local perceptions. Field survey was carried out to collect necessary information for each case study. We conclude that decisions that will restrict the natural resource benefits for the local public, will lead to negative local perceptions of the project and lead to adverse behavior and negatively affect sustainable forest management efforts.

These habitats are also of outstanding international scientific significance in the predictive study of world wide coral ecosystem responses to the effects of global warming. In recognition of their importance, Dolphin Energy has sponsored and taken an active role in a three year project to assist in the scientific understanding of this endangered habitat, throughout the 86,400 km2 study area that lies within joint Qatari/UAE maritime waters. One of the principal outcomes is the development of a robust, culturally appropriate, scientifically based, regional coral conservation and management strategy. At the core of the project is a unique regional partnership for environmental conservation and management in the Arabian Gulf, involving coordination between two government organizations in two different countries, an energy sector sponsor, local and international NGOs and a renowned international scientific institute. This paper describes the background, structure, achievements and strategies adopted to successfully optimize the political, technical and scientific benefits of the project for all stakeholders. Key project achievements include: Comprehensive mapping and marine resource databases for the joint Qatari/Abu Dhabi waters. Developing marine habitat assessment methodologies, specific to the region, which are internationally compatible.

Past research suggests that public support for fishery policies is a necessary component for sustaining the long-term success of fisheries management. This study predicted public support by examining fishers' perspectives on co-management and fish catch since the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), a commonly employed fisheries management tool. Data were obtained from onsite surveys (n = 505) with fishers from three municipalities in Cebu, Philippines: Oslob, Santander, and Samboan. Structural path analyses revealed that beliefs about co-management and fish catch predicted support for fishery policies (R2 = 59%). Separate path analyses for each municipality showed that co-management had greater influence in predicting public support for fishery policies in Oslob and Santander. Fish catch was a better predictor for public support for fishery policies in Samboan. Results can help local governments, non-governmental organizations, and fishery managers to prioritize, plan, and improve fisheries management in municipal waters.

In this article, we focus on gender differences in local residents' attitudes toward protected areas in Myanmar. We found women are less likely to have a positive attitude toward the protected areas and are less likely to express perceptions of problems and benefits associated with the areas than men. Using decomposition analysis, we find that the majority of the difference between men's and women's attitudes is explained by these differences in perceptions. Further, much of the difference is explained by men being more likely to perceive conservation and ecosystem service benefits than women, which is the most influential determinant of attitude.

This study examined the attitudes of 2915 residents in 97 communities around three protected areas (PAs) in upper Myanmar: Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park in the western mountains, Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary in the hills bordering the Chindwin and Uru rivers, and Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary in the central dry zone. Logistic regression indicated a positive attitude toward the PAs was most highly correlated with a perception of conservation benefits and benefits resulting from management of the areas. Attitude was also significantly correlated with a perception of extraction benefits, conflicts with PA staff and crop damage by wildlife. Socioeconomic variables were less powerful than perceptions in predicting attitude and, unlike perceptions, their effects varied among the areas. The much greater effect of perceptions, especially positive ones, on people's attitudes indicates that understanding perceptions is important to improving the relationship between local residents and these PAs. This finding underscores the fact that a focus on conflicts to understand people's attitudes toward PAs may undervalue or miss critical positive perceptions that people hold. Understanding local residents' perceptions of PAs makes possible the creation of strategic, place-based management strategies that build on people's positive perceptions and mitigate their negative perceptions.

Eco-lodges are an important component of ecotourism ventures but an infrequently researched component of this field. Considering their influence on the natural environment (design and operation) and local communities (employment practices and purchases), the success of ecotourism depends, in part, on the performance of eco-lodges. This project studies the effects of the Punta Islita (PI) eco-lodge on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. An interdisciplinary nested-scale analysis, combining guest and household interviews with multi-temporal remote sensing analysis of forest cover change of the lodge and surrounding areas, is used to evaluate the environmental, economic and social impacts of ecotourism in the region. Our results show significant positive contributions of the PI eco-lodge on forest cover, environmental conservation, and local economic incomes within the surrounding communities. For local livelihoods, the PI eco-lodge was seen as having positive social, cultural and economic impacts for nearly all societal variables for both employees and their neighbours. The PI eco-lodge was also perceived as reducing alcoholism, drug addiction and prostitution, where conventional tourism on the Peninsula was shown to increase these 'societal ills'. Land value and product pricing were the few variables believed to have increased as a result of tourism on the Peninsula. For conservation, the PI eco-lodge property had the highest rates of reforestation within the Nicoya Peninsula and remains the scale most reforested in both forest cover change and total forest cover. In fact, at the landscape scale, we find that the Pacific coast of the Nicoya, where the bulk of ecotourism occurs, has undergone reforestation, whereas forest interiors have been deforested. Historically, reforestation occurred as cattle ranching credit programs were halted by the government and households in the area left to find better job opportunities. The PI eco-lodge, as a source of good employment, resulted in worker migration back to the surrounding area, resulting, in some cases, in increased deforestation. Overall, we feel that the PI eco-lodge serves as an example of successful ecotourism. However, increasing development in the region, in particular by standard hotel operations and large condo developments, seeks to capitalise on the region's natural beauty and may reverse land cover trends if they are not accompanied by adequate forest conservation strategies and stresses the importance of monitoring and assessing the impacts of accommodations tied to nature-based tourism operations.

Ecotourism ideals intend to enable communities to benefit from the use of natural and cultural resources available to them by fostering sustainable socio-economic development while maintaining the integrity of those resources. Presently, participation in ecotourism and sustainable development is an issue of contention; mounting criticism due to lack of substantive outcomes, on the one hand, are weighed against conventional tourism characterized by the absence of community participation altogether, producing progressive discourse with the potential to revolutionize conceptualization and practice of participation. To engage with this debate, the objective of this study was to explore individual and household experiences of long-term participation in Kimana Community Wildlife Sanctuary, a former flagship ecotourism initiative in Kenya. Using secondary data, in-depth interviews, a survey, and participant observation in the community hosting the sanctuary, the study found conflicting experiences of participation, especially in the conceptualization and operation of their communal ecotourism initiative. Even though the initiative has been reported as being inclusive and profitable, the study found differentiated experiences of participation, some of which were congruent and others incongruent with the positive ecotourism outcomes previously reported for this initiative. The study advocates reflexive participation by the community together with national and local institutional changes in order to substantiate community power to impact meaningfully upon the performance of community-based ecotourism partnerships.

At the same time, the poor often depend on a market economy that is volatile. Working on coffee plantations and the collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are the two major livelihood options available for the Adivasi indigenous community in Kodagu, India. The article identifies the institutional factors at global, regional, or local levels that influence the livelihood capabilities of Adivasis. While the creation of a National Park negatively influenced almost all aspects of the Adivasis' livelihood, labor demand on coffee farms, and NTFP collection rights outside the Park provided them with some alternative resources. But deregulation of the Indian coffee market made them more vulnerable to the market economy. The social relations between Adivasis and nearby farming communities have helped them to cope with risks to their livelihoods during crises and emergencies.","journal":"Journal of Political Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Important amongst these is that because NTFPs play an important part in household incomes they can be used to raise the perceived value of forests and thus provide incentives for more sustainable use of the forest estate. However, migrant communities living around forest margins have often been perceived as groups of people most likely to take advantage of the free goods provided by forests in a way that degrades the forest environment as short term benefits are maximised over long-term sustainability. Empirical evidence from the forest zone of south-west Cameroon suggests that for many migrant communities NTFPs are not a significant part (no more than 6%) of household total income and that poorer groups seek diverse livelihood strategies that are not predicated on natural resource use. Whilst richer groups may continue to rely on sources of income from the forest and NTFPs may make up to 15% of household income, for rich and poor alike the value derived from NTFPs is generated by secondary forest and forest fallow rather than less disturbed forest that has been the focus of conservation interest. The view is put forward that forest managers and international donors interested in conservation and development need to reassess the potential contribution of NTFPs in poverty alleviation strategies, and acknowledge that forest conservation priorities of local communities require policies and management systems focused on 'sustainable systems for production of livelihood benefits' rather than protectionist approaches to areas traditionally defined as valuable forest.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This is the case for PFM in the two Ethiopian pioneer sites, Dodola and Chilimo that represent two distinct PFM approaches in Ethiopia. This paper analyses how PFM, after controlling pre-PFM differences, affects members of forest user groups (FUGs) and non-members' total annual incomes, forest incomes, expenditures and livestock asset holdings. Income and asset data were collected from 635 randomly selected households. Data were analysed using propensity score matching models. Results show that in Dodola, where commercial timber harvest is allowed, the introduction of PFM means that FUGs have higher livestock assets and forest income than non-members. The average total income and the expenditure for members and nonmembers, however, were not significantly different. In Chilimo site, the result is the opposite -the introduction of PFM means that FUG members have lower total incomes and assets than non-members. Based on our findings we recommend that the PFM scaling up approaches in Ethiopia, which currently allow FUGs only subsistence use from forest resources, need to be revised.

Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, this study assessed the NTFPs collection situation of the fringe communities after the establishment of Kakum National Park, the extent to which the livelihood of the communities has been improved, and how the presence or absence of livelihood improvement strategies has shaped the attitudes and perceptions of the fringe communities toward the national park. The results showed that about 17% of the household leaders were unemployed. Livelihood support strategies such as livelihood alternatives and enhancement, social capital and sociological tourism were found to be absent. Opinion leaders of the communities reported that no member is involved in the management of the park. In spite of restrictions, majority (88.4%) of the household members enter the national park for NTFP collection. Hunting was found to be third highest activity. The households reported that majority of the NTFPs they collect were not processed indicating that their capacities to add value to the resource have not been developed. They believe that value addition to NTFPs could increase their income levels but did not support the theory that it could safeguard the future availability of forest resources and contribute to their sustainability. The respondents believed that once the resources are in abundance they must be exploited to meet their socio-economic needs, suggesting the nexus between illegal entry to conservation area and unsustainable exploitation of forest resources. The paper concludes that when restrictions are placed on access to forest resources and no alternative sources of income are made, illegal entry becomes the norm. The illegal NTFPs collectors would not view the resources as \"their own\" and would exploit them in an unsustainable way to meet their needs.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The climate change literature shows that agriculture and ecosystems and their services are highly climate sensitive, yet they are the main sources of livelihood that supports a large proportion of residents of the tributaries of the Brahmaputra River Basin. The continuous depletion of ecosystems and loss of agricultural outputs resulting from environmental stressors has a substantial impact on the socio-economic wellbeing of the basins residents, particularly the vulnerable rural poor. This paper uses spatially explicit data from Census, Household Surveys and Earth Observation to develop a transferable methodological approach which investigates the extent of dependence on agriculture and ecosystems as a source of livelihood in the contrasting sub-basins of the Brahmaputra River in the State of Assam, India and Bhutan, and the risk to these livelihood dependencies in these sub-basins due to potential environmental impacts of climate change. The results from this study constitute a case study in the development of a systematic and spatially explicit set of tools that inform and assist policy makers in the appropriate interventions to secure the livelihood benefits of sustainably managed agriculture in the face of environmental change.

Access to food, education, and health services for Philippine fisherfolk families is directly dependant upon the fish harvest and related health of the marine environment. Pamana represents a unique \"ecohealth\" strategy, linking the health of coastal people and that of their surrounding marine ecosystem. Pamana's activities are viewed by both their membership and barangay (village) health workers as a contribution to nutritional and community health. The alliance has developed an approach to the empowerment of fisherfolk that has led to improvement in health, food security, and nutritional status of their communities. The development of Pamana provides a model for building capacity in other fishing- and resource-based cultures, through engagement and empowerment. In less developed countries, grassroots initiatives, such as Pamana, may be the only solution for sustainable fisheries contributions to food security, given the challenges of fisherfolk poverty, environmental degradation, and limited finances.","journal":"Ecohealth","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Since opening to tourism in 1974, its unique landscapes, biodiversity, and culture have attracted adventure-seeking tourists from all over the world. Tourism, especially in the past few decades, has developed very rapidly, bringing many economic and social changes with adverse environmental impacts. By recognizing the threats posed by unplanned tourism, a number of organizations and institutions working in the area felt the urgency to initiate sustainable community-based tourism projects that would protect the local wildlife and natural resources and offer alternative livelihood opportunities to the local population. The homestay model in Ladakh is designed on the principle of equitable access and hence is available for adoption by households across economic classes. This article uses the particular case of Korzok homestays, implemented by the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF-India) near the Ramsar wetland Tsomoriri, to illustrate how community development needs can be integrated with conservation goals. It elaborates on the evolution of the initiative, some early impacts, and how the initiative might evolve in the future. A general list of recommendations is also presented.

In many countries, agricultural research and development (RandD) has had limited success in improving agricultural productivity and the livelihoods of resource-poor households. Impact assessment (IA) can measure and quantify the benefits and consequences of RandD investments. Although IA of agricultural RandD gained momentum in the 1990s in Eastern and Southern Africa, relatively few of the studies in Africa have been published. This chapter synthesizes the results of the IA studies included in this book and compares them with similar studies in other regions of the world. The available evidence indicates that rate of return for many RandD investments in Eastern and Southern African countries has been high for a wide range of programmes and commodities. Several challenges remain. There has been little methodological and practical work in assessing the economic impact of nonresearch outputs such as training, networking, advisory services, and policy and institutional reforms. Many assessments of the environmental impacts of RandD programmes are using qualitative methods because of the lack of data. At present, IA results in Eastern and Southern Africa are mainly used to satisfy external accountability and reporting. Few agricultural research managers use evaluation results to support their resource allocation decisions. Fewer institutions have developed formal institutional evaluation systems to support decision-making and institutional learning. IA remains relatively new and externally driven. Institutional and human capacity is still lacking to assess impact regularly, incorporate results in a continuous process of planning research, update research outcomes and revise research plans. National RandD systems need to pay greater attention to internal learning, accountability and institutionalizing feedback mechanisms in developing IA procedures.

Case Alburnus Maior","dAbstract":"The nature of environmental and human rights problems is similar in all the states of the world. Such common concerns includes land based pollution (rapid industrialisation, mining, logging, firewood collection, livestock grazing, land degradation, hazardous waste, waste water disposal). Environmental deterioration could eventually endanger life of present and future generations Therefore the right to life has been used in a diversified manner. It includes, inter alia, the right to survive as a species, quality of life, the right to live with dignity and the right to livelihood. Right to life guaranteed by all Human rights declarations and international documents includes the right of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life. A significant number of decisions at the national and international levels have identified environmental harm to individuals or communities, especially indigenous peoples, arising as a result of violations of the rights to health, to life, to self-determination, to food and water, and to housing. Particularly in the European system, a clear connection has been made between a violation of the right to privacy and life and the right not to be subject to pollution, including the right to know whether pollution is likely to affect a particular individual or community. Nevertheless, industrial development is also important for survival and making jobs for the people, in order to protect their right to life by creating jobs for them. It is important to find a balance between the right to a clean environment and the needs of people for jobs, for exploitation of earth's resources in order to live from it's goods, and finally survive. The kind of environmental concerns that can be raised include destruction of plants and animals, pollution, loss of jobs and small businesses and property values. Government must make sure that development which meets present needs must not compromise the needs of future generations.

Five criteria with corresponding indicators were identified and selected namely, acceptability, biotic diversity, economic performance, enforceability, and equity. The weights of importance of criteria and indicators were determined through the Analytic Hierarchy Process applied in a case study with 23 resource user groups (categorized as fishers, local government unit, non-government organization, private sector and women) in San Miguel Bay, Philippines.The results of this study revealed that overall, acceptability is the most important criterion in evaluating the impacts of fisheries management strategy in San Miguel Bay, especially for the local government units and fishers groups. The best measure of acceptability criterion are the indicators resource users participation in fisheries management process, level of awareness of resource users in fisheries resource management and number of fishers who belong to an organization. Ten groups have consistency ratios between 0.0 and 0.08 which are within the acceptable level of 0.10. Conversely, most groups (78%) have consistency ratios less than 0.26. Also, the results of the preference analysis are remarkable because among the representative groups, most fishers groups exhibited consistencies in their judgments (average consistency ratios of 0.06-0.08). Economic performance indicators were consistently judged across groups indicating that individuals present higher convergence of views toward economic objective.

Resource use allocation then remains a challenging task for decision makers. Development activities that proceed without proper planning lead to more resource use conflicts and environmental degradation. This chapter presents the findings of a study to identify a strategy for incorporating aquaculture into coastal planning to reduce conflicts in the use of the coastal and river waters of Dagupan City, Philippines. Recommendations to improve coastal planning requirements are discussed. Based on environmental, social, economic and institutional considerations, the river system was subdivided into ten management zones. The zones were further reclassified into priority use zones as 'regulated zone' (Zone 1), 'mariculture and fishing priority zone' (Zones 2-7), 'non-fishery zone' (Zone 8) and 'fishpond priority zone' (Zones 9 and 10). Since unregulated fishpen development was a major concern of the local government, fishpen size and layout were standardized. The output of this study forms part of the legislation, Dagupan City Coastal Fisheries Resources Management Ordinance of Year 2003, Executive Order No 71, Series of 2003. It is intended to promote sustainable aquaculture development, generate livelihood and revenues, institutionalize the production and marketing of milkfish for the domestic and export markets and rationalize the use of coastal resources to ensure social equity and long-term environmental stability.

{"author":"Andenoro, A. C.; Popa, A. B.","year":2012,"title":"Introduction","dAbstract":"The new education must be less concerned with sophistication than compassion. It must recognize the hazards of tribalism. It must teach man the most difficult lesson of all-to look at someone anywhere in the world and be able to see the image of himself. The old emphasis upon superficial differences that separate peoples must give way to education for citizenship in the human community. With such an education and with such self-understanding, it is possible that some nation or people may come forward with the vital inspiration that men need no less than food. Leadership on this higher level does not require mountains of gold or thundering propaganda. It is concerned with human destiny. Human destiny is the issue. People will respond. Norman Cousins The preceding quote provides a powerful message grounded in the idea that our world is becoming increasingly smaller and it is becoming increasingly difficult to make local decisions without global consequences. However, Cousins' quote also indicates the complexity and enormity of the issues facing leadership. To address the development of intercultural communities through humanistic means, leaders will be challenged to create innovative paradigms and practices along with educational curricula that will create the impetus for the development of future global leaders. This scenario is further complicated, as leadership educators will be asked to innovate and attend to the needs of their learners within a system of depleted resources. Higher education and corporate training have been forced to endure the reduction of resources stemming from growing economic concerns. Such diminished resources have created a considerable challenge for leadership educators, as they attempt to develop learners who are competent and equipped with the skills to work with intercultural populations. Parsons (2005) wrote that divisions within the federal government have created the need for new alternatives for learning within higher education, as government funds exacerbated by domestic spending limitations are now, and will be in the foreseeable future, diverted to other priorities. It is unlikely that leaders like Claiborne Pell or Robert Stafford will be walking through the proverbial door and onto the national landscape anytime soon, considering the depletion of the national treasury and the bipartisan struggles facing Congress. Thus, the plight of our learners will fall to the innovative capacities of our educators to create opportunities for growth through alternative means and innovative practice. Where in the past immersion provided the opportunity for the development of these learners, the future will force educators to consider much different methodologies in an effort to develop the necessary competencies for successful interactions with global populations. This symposium addresses the challenge. The symposium provides a collection of scholarly perspectives exploring innovative practices aimed at preparing learners for the work that they do with intercultural communities. With respect to the competing resource limitations, the symposium specifically addresses innovative practices within nonimmersive contexts. Through the symposium, the authors have addressed the cognitive, behavioral, and affective competencies that aspiring leaders need to be successful in global contexts. The following contributions focus on the importance, issues, and methods of developing global competence as a vital piece of leadership education.

Although local SESs can be extremely complex, when they become more tightly linked in the global system, complexity increases very rapidly as multi-scale and multi-level processes become more important. Here, we argue that addressing these multi-scale and multi-level challenges requires a collection of theories and models. We suggest that the conceptual domains of sustainability, resilience, and robustness provide a sufficiently rich collection of theories and models, but overlapping definitions and confusion about how these conceptual domains articulate with one another reduces their utility. We attempt to eliminate this confusion and illustrate how sustainability, resilience, and robustness can be used in tandem to address the multi-scale and multi-level challenges associated with global change.","journal":"Ecology and Society","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The species became recently split up in seven varieties with a distinct geographic pattern. A number of morphological traits separate the species from the co-occurring A. hickelii and A. religiosa. The species is used for charcoal production, as valuable timber and (more recently) as highly priced greenery. However, utilisation is not sustainable and may lead to regional extinction within few decades. Protection of the species seems to be most efficient if based on community forest management. As a new conservation tool we suggest establishment of Christmas tree and greenery plantations which could generate significant income for the local farmers. The existing knowledge on A. guatemalensis should be used to steer utilisation, to generate livelihood improvements for the local Maya communities, and to optimise regional and national conservation efforts. Conservation of the species is urgent because it occurs in endangered highland forests which provide significant ecosystem services including erosion control and supply of drinking water. Inconsistencies in description of the species and gaps in knowledge are highlighted and future research directions suggested.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The ability of Alexandrium to colonize multiple habitats and to persist over large regions through time is testimony to the adaptability and resilience of this group of species. Three different families of toxins, as well as an as yet incompletely characterized suite of allelochemicals are produced among Alexandrium species. Nutritional strategies are equally diverse, including the ability to utilize a range of inorganic and organic nutrient sources, and feeding by ingestion of other organisms. Many Alexandrium species have complex life histories that include sexuality and often, but not always, cyst formation, which is characteristic of a meroplanktonic life strategy and offers considerable ecological advantages. Due to the public health and ecosystem impacts of Alexandrium blooms, the genus has been extensively studied, and there exists a broad knowledge base that ranges from taxonomy and phylogeny through genomics and toxin biosynthesis to bloom dynamics and modeling.

{"author":"Anderson, S.","year":2003,"title":"Animal genetic resources and sustainable livelihoods","dAbstract":"Many of the world's poor depend directly upon genetic, species and ecosystem biodiversity for their livelihoods. In many regions animal genetic resources (AnGR) are a vital component of this biodiversity. An estimated 1.96 billion people rely on livestock to supply part, or their entire daily needs. Complex, diverse and risk-prone peasant livelihood systems need AnGR that are capable of performing the functions required of them in these systems-AnGR that are flexible, resistant and diverse. In order to assess the importance of AnGR, as distinct from livestock per se, for sustaining and improving the livelihoods of the poor, the factors that differentiate between species and breeds in terms of the functions that animals fulfil in livelihoods and household economies need to be better understood. Central to this is the need to understand the functions of livestock as household assets, the full set of purposes the poor have in investing resources in livestock keeping, and the genetic traits that are important for the fulfilment of these purposes. If AnGR conservation is to make a contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor livestock keepers, the relative importance of AnGR from the livestock keepers' perspective should be appraised. Then ways of maintaining and enhancing AnGR best suited to improving the livelihoods of the poor and ensuring equitable access to these resources can be addressed. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Yet wetlands (marshes, bogs, swamps, carrs and river meadows) are greatly threatened habitats for which education is not stemming a tide of destruction. Underlying this is a low perception of their value as natural systems by an adult community that regards them as undesirable, dangerous places. This perception may be innate, the product of long evolutionary association with the negative aspects of wetlands such as disease and impenetrability. Or it may arise simply by learned conditioning, ultimately based on common sense but, in the technological world, at least, no longer justified. A test of these hypotheses - innate versus conditioned perception - was carried out by gathering the views of 183 children aged 6/7 (top infants) and 10/11 (top juniors) in three schools. An innate perception would mean that perception of wetlands was highly negative from the outset and stayed much the same or even improved with age and experience. A conditioned response might be indicated by a view that became more negative with age. Data were gathered by means of a questionnaire in which the children chose adjectives they associated with particular animals or habitats and an interview in which they were shown pictures of habitats and asked for their reactions. Perceptions of infants towards bogs and marshes were consistently more positive than those of juniors whilst perceptions of woodlands improved with age. Perceptions of a variety of animals did not change with age and were much as might be expected, lending credibility to the findings concerning habitats. It is concluded that conditioning leads to negative adult perceptions of wetlands. This conditioning may come from literature, television or orally and it is not possible to rank these sources. However, a wealth of evidence does suggest that wetlands are negatively portrayed in junior and adult fiction but more positively in that written for infants. Teachers of juniors may thus have a key role to play in the conservation of wetlands by attempting positively to counteract the insidious influences of sources of misinformation.","journal":"International Journal of Science Education","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

However, recent evidence from an in-depth study from two sites in Kenya and Uganda shows signs of new social dynamics as a response to these multiple stressors. This paper focuses on the emergence of local social institutions for collective action, in which particularly women farmers organize themselves. Although previous research on collective action has largely focused on common-pool resource management, we argue that collective action is one potential pathway to livelihood and sustainability improvements also in a setting of private land ownership. Trust building, awareness raising and actions to improve livelihood security through risk sharing and pooling of labour and other limited assets have given people more time and resources available for diversification, preventative activities, experimentation and resource conservation. It thereby strengthens farmers' capacity to cope with and adapt to change, as well as contributes to the agency at the local level.

The comparison highlights examples of similarities and differences in exposure-sensitivities and adaptations related to subsistence harvesting and community infrastructure. Subsistence hunting, fishing and trapping on the land and sea ice continue to be valued activities for Inuit in Ulukhaktok and Tuktoyaktuk. In both communities, however, changes in seasonal patterns, sea ice, and weather variability have affected the health and availability of some important wildlife species and have exacerbated risks associated with hunting and travel. Infrastructure in Tuktoyaktuk is highly susceptible to damage due to degradation of permafrost and coastal erosion. The shorelines of the community are prone to erosion, particularly during strong storm events that have damaged buildings and roads in the past. A prominent difference in the capacity of these communities to deal with climate-related exposure-sensitivities is the diversity of their economies and extent to which they rely on subsistence harvesting.

Five centuries of transformations has changed the natural climatic - pulsing lake - wetland system into a confl icting human-regulated lake and drainage - irrigation district. Management responses are directed toward correction of the consequences of ecological change and affect key structuring variables in the direction of undesired change. Based upon models of ecosystem services and decision-making process, states and trajectory scenarios are proposed. Socio-ecological barriers to sustainable adaptive management were identifi ed. Following the resilience-based approach, a set of biophysical and social attributes were identifi ed to promote a societal agreement around a vision of a multi-functional lake - wetland system. An accurate management agenda is proposed to redirect undesired socio-ecological change to adaptive sustainability.

I.; Remolina, F.; Wiesner, D.","year":2013,"title":"Assembling the pieces: A framework for the integration of multi-functional ecological main structure in the emerging urban region of BogotÃ¡, Colombia","dAbstract":"BogotÃ¡, the capital of the Republic of Colombia, is a tropical highland city located 2,650 m above sea level. It is the 25th largest city in the world and, among large cities, is also one of the highest. In common with other cities in Latin America, a large part of its urban growth during recent centuries has been unplanned and informal. The introduction of green spaces into urban planning in BogotÃ¡ began in the mid-20th century, but was first included in official legislation during the 1990s through the concept of Ecological Main Structure (EMS). Initially developed by Dutch scholars, EMS was brought to Colombia via biological conservation practitioners as a means of enhancing biological connectivity in rural and natural landscapes, extended in this case to urban landscapes as a top-level planning instrument. EMS originally included a variety of components, from protected areas and biological conservation tools to environmental urban elements - the emphasis being on biodiversity conservation, without sufficient recognition of specific urban structures and functions. This process led to conceptual disciplinary-based divergence and conflicting political interpretations. The current emergence of EMS as a planning tool for urban regions represents an opportunity for integration, although the risk of divergent interpretations remains, as no integrative conceptual framework has yet been developed. In this paper we review the concepts underlying EMS that have been incorporated within urban and regional planning, especially those of ecological networks and green infrastructure, and also diagnose conceptual and institutional barriers to its current integration, challenges and opportunities which are set in the context of an emerging urban region. We propose a trans-disciplinary framework for multi-level integration of EMS, along a gradient from wild environments to built structures that incorporates emerging concepts such as urban biodiversity, ecosystem services and design in the urban landscape, with the aim of contributing to the creation of an urban landscape that is resilient to environmental change and suitable for human well-being and adaptation.

R.","year":2012,"title":"Protected areas and local communities: An inevitable partnership toward successful conservation strategies?","dAbstract":"Many protected areas (PAs) have followed the conventional and exclusionary approach applied at Yellowstone in 1872. As such, many parks have failed to fully integrate other important factors, such as social, cultural, and political issues. In some cases, this has triggered adverse social impacts on local communities, disrupting their traditional ways of living and limiting their control of and access to natural resources. Such an outcome can undermine protection policies through conflicts between park managers and local communities. The success of conservation strategies through protected areas may lie in the ability of managers to reconcile biodiversity conservation goals with social and economic issues and to promote greater compliance of local communities with PA conservation strategies. However, there are very few quantitative studies identifying what the key factors are that lead to better compliance with PA conservation policies. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of 55 published case studies from developing countries to determine whether the level of compliance of local communities with PA regulations was related to: (1) PA age, (2) PA area, (3) the existence of a buffer zone, (4) the level of protection as defined by IUCN categories, (5) gross domestic product per capita, (6) population density in the vicinity of PAs, and (7) the level of local community participation in PA management. We found that local community participation in the PA decision-making process was the only variable that was significantly related to the level of compliance with PA polices. In general, the higher the level of participation, the higher the level of compliance. This has important implications for PA management and suggests that greater inclusion of local communities in management should be a key strategy for ensuring the integrity of PAs.

They also provide much of the animal protein needed by societies in which food security remains a pressing issue. Assessment and management of these fisheries is usually inadequate or absent and they continue to fall short of their potential as engines for development and social change. In this study, we bring together existing theory and methods to suggest a general scheme for diagnosing and managing SSF. This approach can be adapted to accommodate the diversity of these fisheries in the developing world. Many threats and solutions to the problems that beset SSF come from outside the domain of the fishery. Significant improvements in prospects for fisheries will require major changes in societal priorities and values, with consequent improvements in policy and governance. Changes in development policy and science reflect these imperatives but there remains a need for intra-sectoral management that builds resilience and reduces vulnerability to those forces beyond the influence of small-scale fishers.","journal":"Fish and Fisheries","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

A total of 36 sites were selected and data were collected by formal and informal interview using a questionnaire and group discussion, respectively. Among the 288 (17 female and 271 male) pastoralists interviewed, 144 (50%) reported that traditional grazing practices, although effective for sustainable resource use, are becoming highly marginalised due to ranching, allocation of communal grazing areas to private investors, cultivation and privately reserved pasture areas (Kalo). Recent increases in human and livestock populations, and decreases in grazing lands, have eroded the effectiveness of traditional management to mitigate risks of livestock losses during drought, and resilience of the rangelands, with a severe impact on the livelihood of the pastoralists. A decline in total biomass production and animal performance in the study areas was observed during recent years.

Maps were created delimiting fishing zones, considering the lagoon complex physiographic features, fishing gear in use, depth and the spatial and temporal distribution of catches. The validated results by a study of local knowledge help us to understand how fleets operate during periods of interaction between these fisheries, the perceptions, preferences and tactics of producers to these events. It was found that economic units have permits to exploit multiple resources and must decide in the medium term which fishing gear to invest and in the short term which fishery and area to participate. The impacts of direct interactions are reduced by the users trading strategies, who to choose among more than an open season, use the abundance of the resource as the main criterion (65%), followed by the beachfront price paid for the resource (15%). The spatial interactions analyzed in thematic map of frequency of use showed congestion and distribution problems that tend to worsen over time so it is recommended to move from the management scheme of one fishery to multi fisheries within a region or ecosystem.

These environmental threats caused by point and nonpoint sources are mainly the reason why these areas represent \"pollution-sensitive areas,\" where the risk of deterioration is immediate. However, the risk will decrease and eventually disappear if protective measures are applied. In the present article, a multicriteria decision-making method is proposed for the prioritization of the Mediterranean sensitive coastal areas, taking into consideration criteria of pollution risk such as impact on human health, aquatic ecosystems, and socioeconomic value of the area. Weighting factors were then attributed to the different criteria according to their regional priorities, and a total pollution risk score was calculated for every sensitive area. However, some sensitive areas are more vulnerable than others because of their natural characteristics. Therefore, the total pollution risk score was then multiplied by a vulnerability weighting factor and a Total Sensitivity Score was calculated for every sensitive area. With this method, Mediterranean sensitive areas in coastal zones can be ranked on a priority list and then categorized according to their \"sensitivity,\" in a way that decision-makers can select the most urgent cases to direct their attention for the effective protection of the Mediterranean marine environment. The method is rapid and practicable and has already been used with existing data and information in several Mediterranean countries.","journal":"Environmental Management","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

It fulfills more roles beyond producing food and fibre, it has also 'produced' landscape, wildlife, environment and has given working opportunity and livelihood for people and communities of the countryside. These are ecosocial services, equally important for the whole society and local communities, that arise locally and are non-importable to a region and for which services agriculture and farmers must be paid for. These recognitions have led to the notion of Multifunctional European Agriculture, to the reform of the Common Agricultural and Rural Policy, to the development of its support measures and to the Community allocation of funds. In this view and as a part in the line of the EU alignment tasks was the National Agri-Environmental Programme (NAEP) developed, followed by the Government Decree No. 2253/1999 (X. 7.) on the introduction of the programme. The development programmes and farming of rural areas are highly affected by its agro-ecological potentials, agri-cultural traditions and its environmental sensitivity. Hungary's land use zone system gives a key to find the area categories with different agro-ecological potentials. The basis of this is a land use value scale, assessing agricultural potentials and environmental sensitivity, was developed according to the land use pyramid concept through the characterising agricultural production potentials and environmental sensitivity. These land use zonality gives the basis for the area differentiated National Agri-Environment Programme that sets the framework for an agricultural development in accordance with the multifunctional agricultural model.","journal":"A magyar fÃ¶ldhasznÃ¡lati zÃ³narendszer Ã©s a Nemzeti AgrÃ¡r-kÃ¶rnyezetvÃ©delmi Program (II. rÃ©sz)","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

H.","year":1996,"title":"New Zealand's ITQ system: Have the first eight years been a success or a failure?","dAbstract":"Have the first eight years of the ITQ system been a success or failure? In my opinion the ITQ system has, on balance, been a success, although it has not been problem free. The positive aspects of the QMS have been as follows. 1. The overall perception is that the economic performance of the industry has improved. 2. The biological status of the resource has improved, with rebuild strategies in place for stocks that are below Bmsy. 3. There has been increased industry responsibility in the conduct of their fishing operations and their contribution to fisheries management decision making. 4. An open and transparent stock assessment and TAC setting process has evolved, with participation invited from all the sector/user groups. 5. Bycatch problems appear to have been reduced by fishers adjusting their catch mix and methods of operation, by the adoption of industry codes of practice, and by the implementation of a system of overfishing provisions that has evolved to take into account changing circumstances. 6. Quota busting, dumping, and high grading appear to have decreased. The following are the major difficulties or problems still being encountered, but all are being or will be addressed. 1. The allocation of fisheries rights amongst competing sector/user groups (including the commercial industry, aboriginal/traditional users, recreational fishers and environmental/conservation groups) needs to be clearly defined before property rights are conferred under ITQs. The failure to clearly define property rights in New Zealand has hindered the development of secure access to the fisheries resource for all sector/user groups. 2. There has been no evidence of a substantial reduction in government intervention. However, the recently introduced fisheries legislation gives more responsibility to the various sector/user groups for fisheries management decision making (a form of co-management). 3. The administrative systems of a QMS, especially matching catch against quota, should be kept as simple as possible. The catching right (ACE) should preferably be kept separate from the property right (ITQ). The success of the ITQ system in New Zealand can be attributed to the following four main factors. 1. New Zealand is isolated geographically with no major shared or straddling stocks. 2. Key fishing industry players were strong supporters and promoters of the ITQ system right from the start and were instrumental in getting the system introduced. The system also enjoyed widespread support from fishery managers and politicians. 3. The Government bought back catch histories from inshore fishers to reduce TACs in stressed inshore stocks, so fishers were compensated for catch reductions. 4. At the time of the catch reductions for the inshore species, the offshore, deep-water species were largely underexploited. Subsequently, catches from these latter fisheries increased, which formed a strong economic base for the development of the New Zealand fishing industry.

Through suitable scientific interventions these manmade water resources can be utilized for economic gains as well. But unfortunately, they are used only as dumping sites for disposing of human and animal waste which leads to pollution and 'Eutrophication' due to accumulation of excess nutrients (nitrates and phosphates). Although these ponds hold immense potential for producing high quality food through aquaculture for rural development in developing countries but due to poor management and deteriorating water quality, full aquaculture potential of these resources have not been realized so far. It is therefore, vital to reclaim and manage these water bodies to its optimum productivity status through some appropriate rural friendly scientific technologies. Effective waste water treatments through 'conventional methods', which rely on heavy aeration, are expensive to install and operate. Hence, there is need to explore some 'non-conventional' methods which are not only economically viable and easy to operate but eco-friendly as well. For remediation of village ponds, the first step is to remove the excess nutrients dumped in it. For this purpose, plant based bio-remediation (phyto-remediation) technology is the most promising option. Any aquatic plant that is capable of recovering or extracting nutrients or pollutants and has a fast growth rate coupled with high nutritive value is an excellent candidate for bio-remediation of waste waters. Such plants grow very fast utilizing waste water nutrients and also yield cost effective protein rich plant biomass as a by-product. Duckweeds hold immense potential for both nutrient recovery and utilization as fodder or feed for livestock including fish. Wastewater-duckweed-aquaculture is a perfect eco-friendly integrated package for converting the waste water nutrients into high quality fish protein and augmenting rural economy through generating employment opportunities and additional food security.","journal":"Livestock Research for Rural Development","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

In the 1990s, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Moreton Bay, Australia, formed two distinct social communities ('trawler' and 'nontrawler dolphins') based on foraging interactions (or lack thereof) with commercial prawn trawlers. Members of the two communities almost never associated, despite overlapping home ranges. Since then, changes to fisheries legislation have substantially reduced trawling in Moreton Bay. We used association analyses and social network metrics to compare patterns of sociality among bottlenose dolphins across two periods: 1997-1999 (during trawling) and 2008-2010 (post trawling). Over this decade, their social network became less differentiated and more compact (average geodesic distance between individuals decreased), with significantly more and stronger associations between individuals (mean and maximum half-weight indices increased). The previously described partitioning into two communities has disappeared, with former 'trawler' and 'nontrawler dolphins' now dispersed over the entire social network and associating with each other. This restructuring suggests that although fisheries can influence the social behaviour of bottlenose dolphins, their social structure represents a complex adaptive system that is resilient to disturbance.

In this paper we examine attitudes of primary stakeholders towards forest conservation management in Ghana, with Subri Forest Reserve as the study area. Using a survey methodology, 300 households from 10 communities around the reserve were randomly selected and interviewed with structured questionnaires. The results revealed that primary stakeholders have positive attitudes towards forest management and this was not dependent on the location of the community. They support sanctioning people who degrade the forest and accept the need to get a permit before harvesting. However, they are not in favour of strict protection of the reserve. Their attitude towards forest management is influenced by their perception of forest values, concern about degradation of the reserve, economic benefits they derive from the reserve, exposure to resource-use conflicts and membership of conservation organizations. Our findings suggest that primary stakeholders are interested in forest conservation management. But, to achieve sustainable development, it will be necessary to identify the types and quantity of forest products used and their economic significance and to develop initiatives that will support rural livelihoods.

This paper examines the attitudes of 38 communities towards KNP along its western border. A random survey of 240 households was conducted to assess attitudes towards the Park, and what factors might influence them. Attitudes were measured by responses to 12 related questions, which were transformed to construct an attitude index. Attitudes are more varied than previously reported. Notwithstanding KNP outreach programmes, many respondents had had no interaction with KNP, 72.9% had never been in the Park, and only 32.1% claimed they knew of KNP's activities. Having a household member employed by KNP, age and de jure Traditional Authority affiliation influenced more positive attitudes toward KNP. Negative attitudes were primarily linked with problems associated with damage-causing animals, including inadequate maintenance of the KNP border fence, poor animal control outside KNP and lack of compensation for affected farmers. These findings on relationships between KNP and its neighbours are relevant for many protected areas in similar contexts elsewhere.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Only 20.1 % of respondents had knowledge of MMNP activities, and 95.2% were unacquainted with the Consultative Council, which purportedly represents community interests in park affairs. A community attitude index (CAI) was constructed, aggregating responses to seven attitude-related questions. CAI values ranged from -7 to 7 with a mean of -0.50. Attitudes were primarily influenced by education level and whether households had members who fish. Most attitudes were neutral, largely due to lack of interaction with MMNP. Positive attitudes were mosdy related to the intrinsic value of nature and its services. Negative attitudes were chiefly determined by perceived fuelwood shortages and/or higher prices, or introductions of potentially dangerous animals. These results have particular implications for involving local communities in MMNP management, and may be relevant for similar protected areas in Romania and elsewhere.","journal":"International Journal of Biodiversity Science and Management","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Frequently, these areas are adjacent to formally protected areas and present unique challenges in integrating biodiversity conservation and sustaining livelihoods, especially for resource-dependent rural communities. Although studies have been undertaken on the use of various plants by Tsonga communities, and the economic value of specific taxa, no investigation on the relative importance value that considers both wild flora and fauna, together with landscapes, has been carried out previously in the former Gazankulu homeland. We used a weighted ranking exercise for nine focus groups within three rural villages bordering the Kruger National Park, which are largely dependent on wild resources, to assess the relative importance of landscape units and species-level biodiversity. Landscape units, particularly forest/bush and river/stream, were found to be extensively used in meeting community needs, across a range of resource use categories including maintaining socio-cultural norms. Moreover, landscape units vary among villages and age/gender regarding how they contribute to sustaining livelihoods. In total, 162 taxa were identified, with two taxa (Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra; Ficus spp.) exploited in up to seven use categories. Sclerocarya birrea, Combretum imberbe and Colophospermum mopane were the most highly valued species among those surveyed, contributing 22% to the overall value of wild flora and fauna in the area. Of those identified, 28 faunal (60%) and 10 floral (8.7%) taxa are listed in either IUCN, national or provincial protected species schedules. Based on combined Local Users Value scores, over 20% of all biodiversity value for local communities comes from protected tree species. Similarly, faunal taxa with enhanced protection constitute almost 12% of all local biodiversity value. In developing strategies for resource conservation, it is necessary to recognize this widespread use of the natural environment and the wild products, including those under formal protection, exploited by local people.","journal":"South African Journal of Science","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Traditional societies have paid a great deal of attention to the study of nature conservation. Although Himalaya accounts for 18% of the total area in India, it covers more than 31.05% of India's forest cover and 40% of the species endemic to the Indian Sub-continent. Many mountain societies hence maintained a holistic view of the socio-ecological system. An expression of this relationship is represented in the form of sacred landscape which is a concept identified by many traditional societies and often protected by cultural and religious values. Many protected areas contain sites of importance to one or more faiths. These include both sacred natural sites and built monuments (such as monasteries, temples, shrines, and pilgrimage trails). Enforcement in these protected areas has created a lot of conflicts between the local people and protected area managers, due to the restrictions enforced by these managers against the traditional usufruct rights of the local people. These conflicts tend to act as major hurdles to achieving biodiversity conservation. Conservation of biological resources through religion and belief has a long history in Garhwal Himalaya.

Thirty-three ethnographic interviews held in October 2010 found that 81.8% (N=27) of the fishermen interviewed were able to identify the species by its area of occurrence, coloration, and body size. The subsequent analysis of interviews was based on those 27 fishermen selected. There were no reports of positive interactions, and 52% (N=14) of those interviewed described negative interactions related to whales \"tearing and/or dragging the gillnets\". Accidents between whales and fishing vessels were described by 44% (N=12) of the fishermen. Accidental captures in gillnets were mentioned in 48% (N=13) of the interviews and fishermen believed that these events were caused by whales failing to see gillnets in the water (N=4) and by the position of these nets in the routes frequented by the mammals (N=9). In the fishermen's eyes this type of interaction has minimal impact on fishery. Therefore, is suggested the monitoring of areas frequented by whales and fishery, the use of gillnets away from these animals' migration routes, the search for alternative and lower-impact fishing activities, and the training of local actors for sustainable whale watching tourism in the region.

O.","year":2009,"title":"Personifying sustainable rural livelihoods in forest fringe communities in Ghana: A historic rhetoric?","dAbstract":"This paper examines the concept of sustainable rural livelihood within the context of forest fringe communities in Ghana. The rhetoric of using forestry to sustain community livelihoods has been approached with ambivalence. In this wise, the focus is on the perceived relationships that exist between the forest as an independent resource and the forest fringe communities as dependents of the resource. Within forest-fringe districts like any other local and agrarian environments in Ghana, the livelihoods of the people are largely predicated on subsistent agriculture. Alternatively, it also entails the exploitation of the natural resources including forest resource supplies as integral part of the larger socio-economic sustainability of the these communities in the district. The issue of rural sustainable livelihoods in forest fringe communities has been perceived as a critical approach to meeting the conservation and management of forest resources and the communities that subsist on the resource. Hitherto, the interventions had almost invariably been presented in the well-recognized/ protected forest reserves, under formal institutional management. In recent years however, the need for a shift in this attention has engendered what could be termed as off-reserve forest resources management. In this connection, the off-reserve areas which are predominantly occupied by subsistent farmers in agro-forestry have been advocated as the desired areas for forest resource conservation and management. This is in view of the role played in supplying forest resources both tree and non-tree forest products (NTFPs) on sustainable basis. In this connection, the farmers and forest end-users within forest communities are perceived as agents of operation and change. Ultimately, the long-term goal is to create a strong synergy among various stakeholders of forestry, regarding use rights and responsibilities of conservation and management. This has the avowed aim to promote in the country, particularly in forest fringe communities, commitment to conservation and management of forest resources for sustainable rural livelihoods.","journal":"Journal of Food, Agriculture and Environment","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

However, these resources are depleting due to a variety of factors including agricultural expansion and over-exploitation of forest resources. This paper presents an analysis of the level of local dependence on forest resources and its implications for forest management in Ghana. The paper also outlines the causes of continuing deforestation in the studied region from the perspective of the local residents and discusses what role they could play in addressing the problem. The aim is to share more light on the current causes of deforestation and make suggestions for improved community-based forest management practices that could help to reduce deforestation. Primary data was collected through personal interviews and focus group discussions with 431 household heads randomly selected from three Forest Districts in Ghana. The survey showed that income from agriculture constituted 60% of the average total rural household income. Forest income provided 38% of total household income, and off-farm income 2%. The four most highly ranked causes of deforestation are poverty-driven agriculture, lack of alternative rural wage employment other than farming, household population levels, and conflict in traditional land practices. This shows a shift in the view of local people who in the past were quick to blame logging companies and government policies for deforestation. The majority of the respondents depended on wild animals like snail, bush meat, wild honey and wild and cultivated vegetables. Given the reasons for deforestation, much thought needs to go into agroforestry practices (e.g. snail farming, bee keeping, fish farming, and vegetable production) in efforts to reduce deforestation, which are currently less promoted.

In the last two decades farm forestry (FF) has been promoted through pilot projects among local communities as an example of sustainable land use. However adoption of FF is limited outside the project locations because FF improvement measures focused mainly on biological (e.g. succession, biodiversity and traditional industrial timber production) and technical concerns (e.g. material input delivery such as providing free tree seedlings for field planting) rather than local values, and interests and the constraints facing farmers. This study examined the local farm priorities and constraints and the prospects for the wider implementation of farm-level tree planting in four communities in Rachuonyo District. Using interviews with 597 randomly selected household heads, the study assessed farmer's production assets and activities, land tenure, priority tree species and the constraints to growing trees on farms. Results show that farm labour is represented by a young population, 56.3% under the age of forty. They are mainly engaged in small-scale mixed cropping integrated with multipurpose trees and some livestock. Tree products contribute about 32% to household cash income, more than any other source (agricultural products, labour sales, etc). Females were more often household heads and had considerable influence over productive activities, making them an important target group in FF development. Farmers preferred exotic tree species due to their ability to provide short-term cash income, fuel and shade. Farmers' concerns included population pressure on limited farmlands and the problem of credit for agricultural inputs. Given the feeling of secured tenure arrangement and influence of tree products on the household economy, farmers are likely to invest more in efficient land uses such as FF if consideration is given to local priorities.","journal":"Small-Scale Forestry","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The western and central Pacific region provides at least 60 per cent of the world's supply of raw tuna. Since 1994, efforts have been ongoing to develop a comprehensive conservation and management regime there. On 5 September, 2000, the Convention for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean was concluded and signed. It represents a new threshold in international tuna management as it builds on the principles in the Fish Stocks Agreement. The article analyses the implications of the Convention for the Pacific Island States and what it will mean for tuna management in the region. The Convention is an instrument that will empower the Pacific Island States to harness the resource in a way that enhances their sovereign rights. However, the article points out that the Convention is also threatening because fishing states might want to use it to weaken the control Pacific Island States now have over the tuna resource. The article concludes that the Convention increases the economic opportunities to benefit from the tuna resource and clarifies the legal rights over the resource.","journal":"International Journal of Marine and Coastal Law","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Results of a GIS survey indicated that 53% of the elasmobranch fishery in the UGC occurs within marine protected areas. Elasmobranchs captured in the marine protected areas generate a gross profit of âˆ¼US$ 343,000 annually, with a return rate of 87%. From the results of the present study, it is evident that there is a need for undertaking an interdisciplinary and intensive evaluation of the elasmobranch fishery in the marine protected areas considering the presence of endangered species in the region, in order to formulate an adequate management plan for conservation without major repercussions to the local fishers' livelihood.","journal":"Indian Journal of Fisheries","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

A baseline survey in four neighborhoods in the lower zone of the Rimac watershed in Lima, Peru found that agriculture contributes significantly to household income and complements other non-farm income sources. Three quarters of producers are involved in mixed cropping of vegetables, mainly for commercial sale. Median farm size is 2.0Â±1.2 ha and principal crops are lettuce, beetroot, turnip, aromatic herbs, basil, celery, cilantro, radish, and cabbage. Local producers' problems include biophysical constraints such as pests and diseases, water shortages, and contamination of irrigation and drinking water. There are also institutional constraints such as the lack of recognized land titles, difficulty in organizing local agrarian interests, and problems in the interactions between producers and local political organizations. A major health concern not directly recognized by many producers is pesticide use. Spatial and temporal proximity among actors along the urban production chain worsens the health risk to producers, middlemen, and consumers. The risks are derived from the level of toxicity of pesticides used, the frequency of applications, the length of growing season, and the closeness to harvest, among others. Of pesticides used for lettuce and cabbage, 60% are highly toxic, with variable frequency of application. Producers are unfamiliar with insect lifecycles and concepts of ecological agriculture. To address these issues urban-adapted Farmer Field Schools have been introduced. This is supported by two local governments that identified commercial opportunities for production and marketing of ecological horticultural products.","journal":"Serial","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

By channelling tourism revenue to local residents, conservationists hope to offset wildlife costs and improve local attitudes toward conservation. To date tourism revenue-sharing (TRS) programmes have met mixed success. Local conditions and national policies that shape the success of TRS programmes were identified by comparing the experiences of both implementers and beneficiaries of pilot TRS programmes at three parks in western Uganda. Between 1995 and 1998, communities around these parks used a total of US $83 000 of tourism revenue to build 21 schools, four clinics, one bridge, and one road. In 1996, the Ugandan parliament passed legislation that changed both the amount of money available for TRS and the institutions responsible for sharing the money. The programme was suspended at all three parks while the implementing agency (Uganda Wildlife Authority) struggled to design a programme that complied with the new legislation. TRS funds collected before 1996 were shared through 1998, but since then no revenue has been shared. However, a revised TRS programme is expected to resume in 2001. In semi-structured interviews, both implementers and beneficiaries evaluated local TRS programmes and compared them to other benefit-sharing projects, particularly those promoting sustainable use of non-timber products within park boundaries (n = 44). Both groups of respondents listed revenue-sharing as the most important advantage of living next to a national park. Seventy-two per cent of respondents indicated that they thought TRS had improved attitudes towards the protected areas, and 53% thought TRS was more important then sustainable use of non-timber forest products. Although respondents were generally positive about TRS, in informal discussions respondents repeatedly mentioned four potential obstacles to TRS success, namely poorly defined TRS policies and unsteady implementing institutions, corruption, inadequate funds, and numerous stakeholders with differing priorities. From this survey and literature from experiences in other African countries, there are four key components of successful revenue-sharing programmes: long-term institutional support, appropriate identification of the target community and project type, transparency and accountability, and adequate funding. With firm institutional support and realistic expectations, TRS can play an important role in improving local attitudes towards conservation.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

These changes are even more important in small Mediterranean islands, where the flow and type of ecosystem services (ES) is constrained by insularity and heavily exploited by economic activities. We evaluated the dynamics of ES from 1954 to 2007 linked to the changes of the landscape of the Vulcano Island (southern Italy) and related such transformation to the perception of the local communities. We estimated the changes in the total economic value of ES and we coupled this objective assessment with a survey among inhabitants to measure the perception of driving forces and ES. The results show that agriculture was replaced by tourism, which simultaneously has profoundly affected the landscape and brought economic benefits to local population. Despite the urban-sprawl related to tourism development there is an increase of the flow of ES over time because of the conversion of some land-cover classes into others that provide a greater amount of ES. Local communities are aware of landscape and ES dynamics, but they do not perceive tourism as a driving force, which affects the natural attractiveness and cultural identity of their island. This approach integrates a commonly accepted objective technique to assign value to ES, with a subjective assessment taking into account how local people value the flow of ES. Effective strategies for ES management and governance need to address and incorporate local population expectations so to empower local stakeholders in the achievement of higher level of quality of life.

Research and assessments carried out since 1988 showed an increasing environmental impact of extractive actions resulting in a decline of coral cover and density of fish, mollusc and other marine populations, generating negative effects in the only coral reef in the Gulf of California. The growing importance of tourism activities, especially eco-tourism, as a source of employment and welfare creates the opportunity to shift from extractive actions to a sustainable tourism approach. The purpose of this study was to develop a rigorously planned management strategy to improve the health of the environment and the quality of life of the human population of Cabo Pulmo. The methods used included micro region zoning through a Geographical Information System and capacity of use evaluation, integrating the physical, biological, economical and social characteristics of the study area. Based on the evaluation of indexes of fragility, pressure, and vulnerability, 31 environmental units were proposed. The results showed that the predominant environmental policy would be sustainable management within 40% of the total area, restoration in 1%, and a conservation and protection policy in 48%. The sites with most human impact would need an environmental management policy, with the encouragement of sustainable tourism, while eliminating and further excluding any extreme use or high density traditional tourism. Many workshops and meetings have been organized to recommend management actions focusing on sustainable tourism and to discuss how to tailor specific features. After more than 15 years, a recent evaluation of this coralline system, now a National Park, demonstrated that the quality of life of the local inhabitants has improved, and that there is a healthier ecosystem with coral recovery, and many sea turtles, sharks, other fish and invertebrates.

We assessed attitudes towards three facets of conservation: the tiger, an emblematic species signifying India's commitment to wildlife conservation; the forest, a principle source of fuel-wood and other products; and the Forest Department, which manages the forest. More specifically we predicted that (i) attitudes would be an effective predictor of resource use interest in the forest and (ii) benefits obtained from the EDP would create more favorable attitudes towards conservation and the protected area employees. Twelve villages located within 3 km from the reserve boundary were chosen and 2-3% of the households interviewed with regard to their attitudes towards these three facets of conservation, their household resource use patterns, wealth, sex, age and length of residency. We found significant associations between wealth, sex, age and both tiger and forest conservation. Providing benefits has not changed the underlying attitudes of the communities. The poorer sections of society, whether receiving benefits or not, tended to support tiger conservation because conserving wildlife did not affect their livelihood in any way, whereas both the rich and poor had misgivings about forest conservation due to dependency on forest products. We conclude that the eco-development project has not effectively addressed the most important of the local concerns. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

{"author":"Arlinghaus, R.","year":2006,"title":"Overcoming human obstacles to conservation of recreational fishery resources, with emphasis on central Europe","dAbstract":"Recreational fisheries are the dominant or sole user of many coastal and most inland fish stocks in industrialized societies. Recreational angling can negatively affect fish populations, but appropriate management approaches to address these impacts are often lacking. Overall, privately-governed European recreational fisheries systems offer suitable conditions to reconcile resource use with resource conservation because access restriction is possible, decision-making structures are simple and management scales are small. This increases the hope that the race to fish may be less pronounced than in open-access commercial fisheries. To achieve harmony between use and conservation values, a thorough understanding of the human dimension is paramount, yet approaches including this are underrepresented in contemporary recreational fisheries science and management. Based on theoretical considerations, literature review and personal experiences, this paper presents key human obstacles to the reconciliation of recreational fishery resource use and resource conservation, with emphasis on private fishing rights regimes of central Europe. Nine obstacles are identified: (1) lack of social priority; (2) lack of integrated approaches; (3) lack of cooperative institutional linkages; (4) lack of systems thinking; (5) lack of research and monitoring; (6) lack of shared values and dominance of stereotyped perceptions; (7) lack of consideration for regional fish-angler dynamics; (8) lack of objective communication of scientific findings; and (9) lack of critical self-reflection among individual anglers. Potential solutions to overcome the identified constraints briefly discussed include: (1) evaluation of the socioeconomic benefits of angling; (2) rehabilitation of ecosystem structure and function on larger scales; (3) facilitation of structured cooperation between stakeholders and management units; (4) application of complex systems approach; (5) increased funding for long-term monitoring; (6) fostering of common values of different stake-holders; (7) active adaptive management of angling effort on regional scales; (8) intensified communication of research findings; and (9) conviction of anglers to meet personal targets by more restrictive regulations. Increasing research and management efforts related to the social component of recreational fisheries will improve reconciliation of resource use and resource conservation in traditional recreational fisheries management. It is a matter of societal values whether it is judged necessary to do so on a broader scale.

To counterbalance these impacts, an ecosystem approach to recreational fisheries may be needed. This chapter reviews the meaning and relevance of the ecosystem approach for recreational fisheries focusing on inland waters. It examines the principles behind the approach and potential constraints on adoption in recreational fisheries management. Most of the principles of the ecosystem approach for recreational fisheries are already enrooted in a properly defined sustainability paradigm. Thus, the concept is not new. For its success, it is important to account for the vital role of the human dimension in at least two areas: setting of management objectives and expecting paradoxical dynamics resulting from the anglers' behaviour. Local capacity-building and self-empowerment of anglers to internalize the importance of an ecosystem approach to recreational fisheries management is crucial if recreational fisheries are to be integrated into the wider framework of aquatic ecosystem management.

An attempt was made to break down some of the barriers to more interdisciplinary research on recreational fisheries at the 6th World Recreational Fishing Conference. The overall conclusion was that future research and management efforts should increasingly focus on the feedbacks between the interacting human and ecological components of recreational fisheries. Doing so promises to improve understanding of how recreational fisheries respond to social-ecological change. In this context, the behaviour of both fishes and humans provides an important, yet often overlooked, integrator of the ecological and social components of recreational fisheries. A better understanding of the behavioural dynamics of recreational fishers as well as exploited fishes will help predict how recreational fisheries change, evolve, adapt and reorganise through time to maintain resilience and achieve sustainability on a global scale.

More than 1/2 million people of indigenous ancestry (mainly Pehuenche and Huilliche) still live in close association with forests in south-central Chile. Indigenous people have been forced to retreat, along with the last remains of native forests, towards marginal lands, characterised by low productivity and limited accessibility. This process has been driven by a historical trend that reassigned public and indigenous land to private or industrial landowners, and by a Chilean forestry policy that has ignored biodiversity and non- timber forest products, and undervalued native forests by providing costly subsidies to industrial plantations for timber and pulp production. As a result of these policies, two major conflicts have emerged: indigenous people encroached by timber plantations are resisting the expansion of commercial forestry, and the conservation of the last remains of biologically valuable habitat is at odds with land-use claims by indigenous groups in less accessible areas. A promising solution to these problems is the development of mixed-use landscapes or \"extractive reserves\", where non-degrading economic uses of forests, such as ecotourism and harvesting of non-timber products, coexist with the provision of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity within indigenous land. Regulation of land use in extractive reserves requires strengthening traditional knowledge of natural resource use and government incentives to manage and conserve native forests.","journal":"Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Commons theorists have approached this question by developing institutional design principles to address collective choice situations, while other analysts have critiqued the underlying assumptions of community-based resource management. However, efforts to enhance community-based natural resource management performance also require an analysis of exogenous and endogenous variables that influence how social actors not only act collectively but do so in ways that respond to changing circumstances, foster learning, and build capacity for management adaptation. Drawing on examples from northern Canada and Southeast Asia, this article examines the relationship among adaptive capacity, community-based resource management performance, and the socio-institutional determinants of collective action, such as technical, financial, and legal constraints, and complex issues of politics, scale, knowledge, community and culture. An emphasis on adaptive capacity responds to a conceptual weakness in community-based natural resource management and highlights an emerging research and policy discourse that builds upon static design principles and the contested concepts in current management practice.

In this context, the role of key policy windows for innovative governance practice is assessed (e.g., changes to Land and Fisheries Laws). Also examined is the emergence of recent initiatives to catalyze a wider shift in governance practice in the region, including the formation of co-management institutional networks that contribute to trust building and learning, and the allocation of collective territorial use rights for fisheries. While these changes are consistent with experiences in other coastal marine contexts, the paper shows that place-based and longitudinal research is necessary to explain and predict the conditions and incentives that catalyze governance shifts. Differences between a governance change and more fundamental transformation are difficult to discern using point-in-time analysis. Moreover, the results show that current declines in ecological conditions in the lagoon may not be reversed by changes to access rights or the emergence of co-management. Rather, these governance changes may simply help to stabilize the situation and buy time until other livelihood opportunities arise. Assessments of governance transformation thus need to be linked to ecological outcomes (i.e., reversing degradation of coastal marine systems, avoiding biophysical tipping points) which may not be easily identified in the short-term. Despite uncertainty, the emergence of policy windows, evidence of institutional innovation, and small-scale rights allocation experiments, all suggest important shifts in the trajectory of governance are underway in the Tam Giang Lagoon.

Drawing on examples from the Banawa-Marawola region of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, a suite of traditional resource management practices premised on principles of adaptive management are identified and assessed, including: (1) resource management practices and regulations that are associated with the dynamics of complex systems; (2) procedural, planning and decision-making processes that foster learning; (3) sanctions and taboos that act as social mechanisms for the management and conservation of natural resources; and (4) ceremonies and social interactions that promote cultural internalization of the various practices, procedures and mechanisms. In addition, an emerging socio-political movement in the Banawa-Marawola region is explored. Premised on the strengthening of traditional rights and practices, the nascent Kamalise movement potentially provides the socio-political, institutional and organizational context needed to link traditional agroecological knowledge and adaptive management with broader conservation goals. Based on this analysis, two opportunities to enhance conservation in the region are identified: first, maintaining traditional agroecological systems and the associated adaptive resource management strategies used by local groups, and second, building upon the Kamalise movement to forge conservation alliances among communities, non-government and government organizations in which locally-evolved adaptive resource management strategies can be effectively applied. Both opportunities to combine traditional knowledge, adaptive management and conservation, however, are linked to the development aspirations of traditional groups: self-determination, acquisition of land rights and controlling the impacts of changes in livelihood.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Conservation farming (CF) has been actively promoted in seven of Zambia's nine provinces since the 1980s. CF has the technical potential to contribute to food security and adaptation to climate change; however, rigorous analyses of the determinants of adoption/dis-adoption of these practices, are still scarce. This paper fills this gap by combining rich panel data with historical rainfall data to understand the determinants of adoption and intensity of two CF practices: minimum soil disturbance and crop rotations. Controlling for the confounding effects of household level unobservables, we find that extension services and rainfall variability are the strongest determinants of adoption, suggesting that farmers use these practices as an adaptation strategy to mitigate the negative effects of variable and delayed rainfall. Furthermore, our findings highlight the role of agro-ecological and socio-economic constraints in explaining adoption, as well as the potential role and effectiveness of interventions to support it. Eastern province shows a significantly different trend in terms of both adoption and the intensity of adoption, indicating that the long-established CF activities in the province have had some impact - though high dis-adoption rates are observed even in this province.

The reserve supports rich floral and faunal species diversity. The virgin forest cover of this nature reserve has been considerably reduced, degraded and fragmented by clear-felling for human settlements, shifting agriculture and massive extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), particularly Zalacca secunda, an endemic stemless rattan palm. There are 12 villages with a population of 4191 in the northwestern periphery and 13 villages with a population of 5147 in the southeastern periphery of the park. The core zone of the park has two major Lisu local settlements with a total of 43 households. The local people totally depend on the nature reserve for their livelihood. This article focuses on the human-generated threats (due to immigration pressure and its consequences manifesting as clear-felling for settlements and agriculture, overharvesting of NTFPs, hunting and poaching of rare and endangered fauna, uncontrolled fishing in the river, etc.) to biological diversity in the nature reserve. For better management of Namdapha nature reserve, approaches like formation of biodiversity management committees in the fringe villages, creation of a buffer zone in the southeastern boundary of the park, resettlement of encroached communities in the core zone, provision of alternative conservation options (substitutes for roofing and fuelwood) and deployment of more field staff for better patrolling are recommended.","journal":"Current Science","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Arunotai, N.","year":2006,"title":"Moken traditional knowledge: An unrecognised form of natural resources management and conservation","dAbstract":"This article presents the traditional knowledge of an ethnic group of sea nomads generally known in Thailand as Chao Lay. The Moken once led a nomadic marine life. They have developed their traditional knowledge and belief system over several centuries. This practical knowledge has been obtained through interaction with local ecosystems and from observation and experimentation in everyday life. The Moken have intimate knowledge relating to the sea and the forest, and they have elaborated boat-building skills and other technologies that allow them to make their living from the sea, coastal areas, and islands. This traditional knowledge and attendant practices represent a form of natural resources management and conservation. It comprises: 1) knowledge and skills that depend upon simple technologies that have minimal impact on the natural environment and its resources; 2) a nomadic life with frequent displacements that allow the Moken to rotate their foraging grounds and prevent overuse and degradation of specific areas; 3) knowledge about numerous forest and marine species -their characteristics, behaviour, habitats and eco-niches -which enables the Moken to make use of a diversity of local ecosystems; 4) a hunter-gatherer livelihood focusing primarily upon subsistence, with little accumulation of material goods, and finally 5) a philosophy and belief system that holds that natural resources are not individually owned, but rather are to be shared by everyone without restrictions on access. The sharing ethic is very strong in the Moken community and resources are shared not only with fellow humans but with supernatural beings as well. This system of traditional knowledge, know-how and representations has never been recognised nor respected. Rather than a form of natural resources management and conservation, it has been misinterpreted as part and parcel of a \"primitive\", underdeveloped, and materially poor livelihood. For mainstream society, development for the Moken necessarily requires the termination of their \"primitive\" life and the embracing of modernity. Through this pathway to development, however, the Moken are likely to lose their traditional knowledge and the sustainable livelihood that has ensured their physical and cultural well-being for centuries.

This study was designed with the objectives of assessing the contribution of forests to annual income of rural households and identifying its determinants using the case of Jelo Afromontane forest in eastern Ethiopia. It also examined the gender dimensions of forest income, and how this income varies with the wealth status of households. Key informant interview, focus group discussion and household-based questionnaire survey were used to collect data. On average, income from crop production accounted for 40.7% of the total annual household income. Forest income was second in importance, contributing 32.6%. Income from livestock, off- and non-farm activities, and woodlots accounted for 13.6%, 11.4%, and 1.7% of the total household income respectively. Firewood was the most used forest product and constituted the largest proportion (79%) of the total forest income. The contribution of forest income to the total household income varied significantly (P<0.05) with wealth category. Forest income was more important for poor households (47.3%) than for medium (30.5%) or rich (20.2%) households. It was also more important for female headed households (58.2%) than for male headed households (29%). The gender dimension of forest income was also apparent within the household. Female members generated about four times more forest income (77% of the household forest income) than male members (23%). The sex of the household head (P<0.01) and distance to the forest (P<0.05) were the two determinant variables that significantly affected forest income out of the eight explanatory variables considered in the regression model. Policy to promote new forest management arrangement such as participatory forest management (PFM) in Jelo forest needs to take into account the major forest users and the types of products they depend on, and be accompanied with other poverty reduction measures so that improved forest conservation outcome will not have negative consequences on local livelihoods, particularly on poor and women, who depend most on the forest.

Efforts for making sustainable marine fisheries development plans pragmatic, necessitates participatory resource management and biodiversity conservation harmonized with attainment of societal, economic as well as ecological well being. Any scientific intervention attempted in a rural society, without regard for traditional and indigenous knowledge systems of local people has often failed. In recognition of these issues, an attempt was made to study the scope of genesis and development of a new paradigm, ethnofisheries. It deals with the indigenous and traditional knowledge items of marine fisheries sector and its significance in the contemporary fisheries management scenario of India. The perception of the actual repositories of this traditional wisdom was also studied regarding the relevance of conserving and scope of applying this knowledge in the current scenario. The Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITK) from a coastal state of Kerala was collected to illustrate the relevance of the traditional wisdom. The significance of ITK of marine sector in the present context is elicited from the viewpoint of policy makers, technocrats as well as fisher folk.

This paper examines how an indigenous resource management system has operated and supported the protection of an Afro-alpine area in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia. The community was mainly concerned to regulate their own use of natural resources, including collection of firewood and thatch, and grazing by livestock. The original common property resource management system operated under a previously undescribed indigenous institution known as the Qero system, which was enforced through sanctions and punishments imposed by the community. The Qero system was suspended following the Agrarian Reform in 1975, which resulted in the breakdown of the traditional land tenure and land rights systems within Ethiopia. In the Central Highlands, user rights and management responsibility shifted to include formerly marginalized groups. Nevertheless, the common property management system has shown sufficient resilience to withstand these changes and pressures, and is still functioning with defined user groups and byelaws to regulate resource use and manage the area. Nevertheless, attitudes to current and future management are polarized between former and present managers of the common property regime.

{"author":"Ashley, C.","year":1998,"title":"Tourism, communities and national policy: Namibia's experience","dAbstract":"Since independence, the tourism sector in Namibia has grown rapidly (National Planning Commission, 1995). Since 1995 community involvement in tourism has been an explicit government strategy, promoted by a range of governmental and non-governmental actors. Much has already been learned about the economic, social, and livelihood impacts of tourism in rural areas, and how these are shaped by the type of tourism and, in turn, by government policy. This article starts by categorising tourism initiatives on communal land into five different types, and assessing the financial and social impacts of each. However, if the long-term aim is 'rural development', measures of financial and social impact are too limited, and a broader perspective -- contribution to livelihood security of different stakeholders - is proposed. This assessment is based on the direct contribution of tourism to a variety of household needs and assets, as well as its indirect impact through conflicts and complementarities with other livelihood activities and land uses. As many community tourism initiatives also have conservation objectives, the article reviews additional criteria that need to be considered to achieve these, such as a tangible link between sustainable management and rewards from tourism, and distribution of benefits across all members of a common property resource regime. Performance of tourism initiatives is assessed against these criteria and constraints identified. The article then moves on to outline the various strategies that have been used to promote community involvement in tourism. In conclusion, it identifies lessons learned to date in Namibia, and draws implications for policy-makers on the range of strategies that can be useful in enhancing positive impacts and minimising negative ones.","journal":"Development Policy Review","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

R.; Batvandi, Z.; Karimi, H.; Soroushnia, R.","year":2011,"title":"Importance of Ghale Shadab Prohibited Hunting Area in Khuzestan Province from stakeholders point-of-view","dAbstract":"Introduction Protected areas (PAs) are well known to act as sources for food, fuel, clothing, and medicines. Unfortunately, as these resources diminish outside Pas, the pressure on them becomes more intense. For this reason, landscape approaches are required to protect and restore the ecosystem services of PAs. This is especially critical due to the fact that by 2025 over 60% of the world's \"absolute\" poor will live in rural areas, depending directly on the natural resources around them. There are many instances where PAs support local requirements while discouraging commercial interests of outside from rapidly depleting resources. PAs also directly contribute to increased resources - for example-in agriculture, through services such as pollination, or in fisheries through the creation of \"no take\" zones that allow fish stocks to recover. All over the world, PAs are established by governments, nongovernmental organizations and private entities with the aim of conserving biodiversity, and in most cases, without considering how PAs would affect the interested parties and their livelihoods. As a result, today PAs are seen as controversial tools for biodiversity conservation, since according to the mainstream narrative, they have caused the impoverishment of the local population through evictions and denial of access to natural resources. Taking this into account, the linkages between PAs and well-being of people living in or around them has therefore become a practical and ethical necessity. It is a practical necessity, because to survive and achieve their conservation objectives, protected areas need the support of local population and international community. It is an ethical necessity, because as it is widely recognized, conservation objectives cannot be pursued at the expenses of people's well-being. Protected areas such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries are physically shared by ecologically important flora and fauna, tourists, government officials, scientists and communities living in and around them. The benefits of protected areas extend to users at different scales, from local people who depend on particular species for their livelihood, to nations that depend on abundant freshwater and global community that depends on nature's capacity to regulate climate. Worldwide, many countries and regions, rich in biodiversity and poor in economy, have been vigorously promoting ecotourism as a conservation tool in their PAs since 1990s. PAs have played significant roles in tourist attraction in many countries since their establishment. Tourism can be an effective tool in the conservation and management of PAs. It can provide financial and political supports to conservation, and lead to a greater understanding of the value of PAs - which in turn can lead to more areas being protected. There is a wide range of opportunities for ecotourism in PAs. Such opportunities are revenue generation (i.e., user fees, entranced fees and donations), employment opportunities, and justification for protected areas, healthier economy, environmental education, and improved conservation efforts. In addition, Participatory development is consistence with planners in the direction of \"with and for people\" planning. Identifying what types of ecosystem services a protected area provides, who captures the benefits, what would happen if the services were lost, who would pay to replace them or who would suffer, is a good starting point. Material and methods: This study is based on a survey to study the importance of Ghale Shadab Prohibited Hunting Area (GSPHA), 30km north of Dezful in Khuzestan Province, from the perspective of stakeholders. This region (5000ha) was established as Prohibited Hunting Area in 2008. Maximum and minimum absolute temperatures are 28.5Â°c and -6.5Â°c, respectively, whereas average annual precipitation is about 474mm. typical large mammals include Ursus arctos, Panthera pardus, Capra aegagrus, Hyaena hyaena. Also, notable bird species include Alectoris chukar and Ammoperdix griseogularis. People living in or arou d GSPHA are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, agriculture, fishery and tourism. Findings revealed that 38% of visitors are unemployed. To collect data and information, a query was conducted in the study area. Stakeholder's survey was conducted to evaluate the importance of GSPHA. Stakeholders were divided in three groups including tourists, local communities and organizations. Also, three types of questionnaires were prepared. A total of 750 respondents were interviewed representing different socio-economic and occupational groups. The respondents were selected randomly to avoid serious bias. The aim of the survey was to gather information related to demography of stakeholders (e.g., age, education and occupation), willingness to environment and wildlife, sustainable use of environmental resources, willingness to participate in environmental conservation, study of problems in GSPHA, and tourism potential of the region. Descriptive statistics were derived to summarize the property of the dataset, while analytical methods (correlation and chi-squared test) were used to analyze the data and test their differences (at 95% level of significance). Analysis was conducted using SPSS ver. 11.5 and Excel. Results and Discussion: Establishment of PAs has been the most widely accepted means of biodiversity conservation so far, supported by national and international agencies. Most communities have developed their identity and cultural characteristics over time by devising and applying a strategy to cope with a given environment, and manage its natural resources. They possess a distinctive form of social organization, and their members share in varying degrees of political, economical, social and cultural characteristics (in particular language, behavioral norms, values, aspirations and often also health and disease patterns). They also function, or have functioned in the past, as micro-political bodies with specific capacities and authority. Findings showed that stakeholders use wide range of environmental resources in this region. Study findings showed that 61.5% of tourists, 78.7% of local communities and 92% of organization personnel were male and the rest were female. This study also showed that 66.5% of tourists, 16% of local communities and 64% of organization personnel had college educations. Findings revealed that 46.4% of tourists, 41.3% of local communities and 35% of organization personnel belonged to young groups between the ages of 20-30. 50.7% of local communities were farmers, husbandmen and fishermen. Furthermore, 38 % of these communities were unemployed. The results revealed that the tourists are varied by age, sex, education, culture and occupation. In general, the number of male visitors is higher than that of female visitors in outdoor recreation and youth groups are more interested in outdoor recreation. The visitors belonged to more than 21 provinces of Iran. High percentage of younger groups and visitors with college education indicates a high tourism potential of this region. The results also revealed that education can play a vital role in determining the demand for recreational activities at the GSPHA. Lake of Dez Dam, beautiful landscapes, rivers and springs beauty, wilderness region and wildlife, Shadab historical castle and living methods of local communities were important factors for tourist attraction. This finding corresponds with the opinion of Ceballos-Lascurain (1993) that green spaces with their landscapes, flora and fauna as well as their cultural elements form attractions for tourists. According to the visitors, the remarkable problems are insufficient toilets, accommodation problem, nonavailability of drinking water, and lack of proper communication facilities, lack of sufficient safety, security and guiding, lack of parking spaces for motor vehicle. Studies on people participation in outdoor recreation found that it revitalizes human spirit, restores people's initiatives of life, and produces feeling of well-being, satisfaction, creativeness and physical conditions. Government can create o portunities to develop the tourist industry based on natural resources and protected areas (ecotourism). Tourism as a tool for wildlife and wilderness areas conservation can be promoted, and from a community perspective it is expected to provide benefits that ultimately enhance local support for the conservation of natural resources. GSPHA's resources provide a wide range of products that are used for income and subsistence by the local communities. The majority of local communities (gt;70%) believed that their dependence to GSPHA is high and very high. Supplying the forage for livestock, outdoor recreation, water supply, exploitation of wild growing medicinal plants, firewood supply, food supply, handicrafts production and Exploitation of sand and gravel are the most important uses of indigenous communities in this area. An increasing number of studies show this type of correlation between household status and livelihood dependence on ecosystem goods and services, often sourced from protected areas. Estimates of the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services can provide powerful and much needed arguments to leverage additional protection for natural ecosystems which are important for development and poverty reduction. Unfortunately, economic planning has still largely failed to internalize the importance of protected areas for poverty reduction.","journal":"Journal of Environmental Studies","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

While other sectors (e.g., business) frequently emphasize creative thinking to overcome complex challenges, creativity is rarely identified as an essential skill for conservationists. Yet more creative approaches are urgently needed in the effort to sustain Earth's biodiversity. We identified 4 strategies to develop skills in creative thinking and discuss underlying research and examples supporting each strategy. First, by breaking down barriers between disciplines and surrounding oneself with unfamiliar people, concepts, and perspectives, one can expand base knowledge and experiences and increase the potential for new combinations of ideas. Second, by meeting people where they are (both literally and figuratively), one exposes oneself to new environments and perspectives, which again broadens experiences and increases ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders. Third, by embracing risk responsibly, one is more likely to develop new, nontraditional solutions and be open to high-impact outcomes. Finally, by following a cycle of learning, struggle, and reflection, one can trigger neurophysiological changes that allow the brain to become more creative. Creativity is a learned trait, rather than an innate skill. It can be actively developed at both the individual and institutional levels, and learning to navigate the relevant social and practical barriers is key to the process. To maximize the success of conservation in the face of escalating challenges, one must take advantage of what has been learned from other disciplines and foster creativity as both a professional skill and an essential component of career training and individual development.

Mahakam Delta was initially covered with dense and diverse mangrove forests. The delta is ecologically and economically important for nursery & spawning ground of fish and shrimps and hence for supporting the livelihood of local communities from fishing activities. However in the last decades there has been a marked increase of local population activities and degradation of mangrove ecosystem due to the extensive use of natural resources resulting in the deforestation of mangrove. Despite the growing complexity of oil and gas operations along with more mature oil and gas fields, TEPI is consistently committed to protect the environment and to live in harmony with surrounding communities as its paramount priorities. Successful oil and gas E&P operations in such environmentally and socially sensitive area require careful and intensive approach to minimize impacts to surrounding environment as well as to surrounding communities. This involves comprehensive environment and social baseline assessment and impact assessment studies, best practice in environment management for effective impacts reduction and mitigations, effective environment monitoring, intensive coordination with local authorities and socialization to local communities to obtain legal and public approval, acceptance, and support for the operations from the very beginning phase of operations planning until after the completion of the operations.

We hypothesized that forest protection can only securely deliver C if significant stakeholders are meaningfully and transparently involved, traditional or customary rights are recognized and their loss compensated for, and there are direct linkages between conservation and development objective. Our research focused on 53 members of the communities of Florida, Porvenir and Piso Firme and 36 secondary stakeholders.

The long-term impact of the NKMCAP on the local communities may well be positive. However, in the short run, certain sections of the local communities are financially poorer. Forest protection projects clearly have the potential to sequester C, protect biodiversity and simultaneously contribute to sustainable rural development, but if they really are to improve rural livelihoods, they must be designed and implemented carefully and participatively.","journal":"Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

These interrelated practices center on famers' agroecological knowledge, decision-making, and cropping strategies and are conceptualized as variable and adjustable socioecological responses to environmental and socioeconomic contingencies. The typology categorizes farmers in terms of their capacity for managing parkland soil and tree resources in an ecologically sustainable manner while negotiating livelihood challenges. It identifies the ideal farmer as one who practices the following: (1) use of environmental knowledge that considers multidimensional relationships among ecological and social components of parkland systems, (2) agricultural techniques that adaptively combine aspects of intensive and traditional extensive agriculture, and (3) natural resource decision-making that explicitly includes women's environmental knowledge and livelihood strategies.","journal":"Agroforestry Systems","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Yet there exist well-established systems and a wealth of local experience in maintaining and managing forests. This study explores the trends and driving forces of deforestation plus traditional practices regarding sustainable forest use and management in the Chencha and Arbaminch areas, Southern Ethiopia. Satellite image analysis (images from 1972, 1984 and 2006) combined with field surveys were used to detect and map changes in forest cover. Household interviews and group discussions with experienced and knowledgeable persons were also employed. The results show a 23Â % decline in forest cover between 1972 and 2006 with the most significant change from 1986 to 2006. Change was greatest in the lowlands and remarkable episodic forest changes also occurred, suggesting nonlinear spatial and temporal forest cover dynamics. According to farmers, the main driver of deforestation is agricultural land expansion in response to local population increases and a decline in agricultural production. Growing local and regional fuel wood demand is another chief cause. Despite these issues, remarkable relicts of natural forests remain and trees on farmland, around homesteads and on fields in every village are basic elements of farm activities and social systems. This demonstrates the effect of cumulative traditional knowledge and long-term local experience with forest management and preservation. Therefore, these practices should be promoted and advanced through the integration of local knowledge and forest management practices in the design and implementation of sustainable environmental planning and management.

A number of selected sites in each of the 3 climatic zones of Benin were surveyed. Data were collected through a field exploration and a semi-structured survey among 435 selected households throughout the country, using a questionnaire. The most culturally important species ranked by locals were determined for each climatic zone and the relations between the targeted species in traditional agroforestry systems and the reasons which support peasants' choices were described through a Principal Component Analysis. A total of 43 wild edible trees were found in the traditional agroforestry systems of Benin during the survey. Traditional agroforestry systems in the Guineo-Congolian zone turned out to be the most diversified with 29 species followed by the Sudanian zone with 22 species and Sudano-Guinean zone with 16 species. The most culturally important wild edible trees in traditional agroforestry systems in the Guineo-Congolian zone were different from those identified in Sudanian and Sudano-Guinean zones. Three main reasons that support peasants' ambition to conserve or to grow wild edible trees in their field were: their contribution to food, their use in traditional medicine and ceremonies and the farmers' perception of their availability in natural vegetation.

Most peasant farmers manage complex and diverse agroecosystems, and constantly adapt management strategies with multiple aims. A sustainability evaluation framework for peasant systems has been applied in over 40 case studies in Latin America, from which 15 were analysed, focusing on the choice of indicators, the effect of alternative strategies on agroecosystem sustainability and the trade-offs involved. Common indicators include yields, income, agrodiversity and external input dependence. Alternative strategies include crop/product diversification and soil conservation practices. Yields, income and agrodiversity improved in most cases, but in some cases the establishment costs increased external input use. Trade-offs observed include improved performance of a subsystem (i.e. crops) vs. decreased one in others (livestock, forestry) and increases in productivity vs. decreases in stability, resilience and reliability. The difficulty of assessing systems in transition towards alternative management was acknowledged by some evaluation teams. Applying the framework to such a variety of cases allowed making the sustainability concept operational, promoted alternative strategies and generated knowledge on agroecosystem processes among stakeholders.","journal":"International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

EBM creates a new series of challenges, problems, and opportunities that must be considered in light of existing governance and management frameworks in a local context. The paper presents five case studies from different parts of the tropical world, including Oceania, insular and continental Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean, which illustrate that the implementation of EBM in watershed and marine ecosystems offers a new series of challenges and opportunities for its inclusion with existing forms of environmental governance and management. The paper suggests that EBM is best thought of as an expansion of customary management (CM) and integrated coastal management (ICM), rather than a paradigm shift, and that it has certain benefits that are worth integrating into existing systems when possible. The paper concludes that the cultural and institutional context of CM as well as the experience, technical skills, and legal basis that serve ICM programs are logical platforms from which to build EBM programs. Some guidelines for creating hybrid management regimes are suggested. In sum, declining marine species and ecosystems require urgent action, necessitating utilization of existing paradigms such as ICM and CM as a foundation for building EBM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A comparison between villages in Roviana, Solomon Islands","dAbstract":"The implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) for fisheries management has increased recently due to the perceived role of MPAs in conserving biodiversity, increasing fish stocks, and enhancing the food security of coastal communities. However, it is unclear whether MPAs may restrict the availability of marine resources and decrease overall food security and the health of the people. In the Roviana Lagoon of the Solomon Islands, we conducted cross-comparisons of villages with MPAs and a village without an MPA to assess whether MPAs influenced local perceptions of governance, environmental change, livelihood strategies, and actual human nutrition and health. Results showed that residents of villages with effective MPAs had higher energy and protein intake than those who had no MPA or an ineffective MPA. We conclude that \"no-take\" marine reserves do not have adverse effects and that when MPAs are effectively sustained they may enhance local nutrition and health.","journal":"Coastal Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The objective is to assist the design of resource management and conservation programs that enhance the capacity of coastal communities in Oceania to confront both diminishing marine resources and the effects of climate change by providing guidelines for protecting marine biodiversity and vulnerable ecosystem functions. This article describes a management framework that hybridizes local beliefs and institutions expressed in customary management (CM) with such modern management concepts as marine protected areas (MPAs) and ecosystem-based management (EBM). Hybrid management accommodates the social, political, economic, and cultural contexts of Oceanic communities and, compared with recent or conventional management approaches, can therefore better address fundamental local concerns such as coastal degradation, climate change, sea level rise, weak governance, corruption, limited resources and staff to manage and monitor marine resources, and increasing poverty. Research on the hybridization of management systems demonstrates opportunities to establish context-appropriate EBM and/or other managerial arrangements that include terrestrial and adjacent coastal-marine ecosystems. Formal and informal CM systems are widespread in Oceania and in some parts of Southeast Asia, and if appropriate strategies are employed rapid progress toward hybrid CM-EBM could be enabled.

We outline the project and the associated biological results, describe the processes involved in attaining a committed level of community participation, and review the lessons learned during the project's implementation. We attribute the project's preliminary success-improved shellfish biomass, enhanced local environmental awareness, and the reinvigoration of cultural management practices-to the following factors: 1) the high level of participatory involvement and community leadership; 2) the local perception that shell beds have recovered rapidly and the role that scientific evaluation has played in reinforcing this notion; 3) a research program that is cross-fertilizing indigenous and scientific ecological knowledge; 4) the unique marine tenure system that allows for the project's development and the area's policing; and 5) the tangible economic incentives created by the development project which ultimately empowers local women. We hope that the project's findings can be generalized to other regions of the world with operational sea-tenure regimes and that it can help to make the establishing of community-based marine protected areas (CBMPAs) across the Pacific region more effective.

The economic performance of fishing operations is affected by various factors including fluctuations in revenue, diminishing catch per unit of effort, unforeseen increases in the cost of key inputs and catch and effort restrictions. Capital and labour will continue to enter the fishery until the economic rents are totally dissipated and profits to individual units are reduced to the level of their opportunity costs. In the long run, the reduction in catch rates lead to reduction in fishing effort levels. The economic performance also plays a crucial role in the investment decisions at micro level. The paper analyses the viability of various mechanized fishing units in the Kerala state using different economic and financial indicators. Socioeconomic impact of fishing ban on fishing labour was also worked out and suggestions were given for improving the livelihood security of fish workers.","journal":"Indian Journal of Fisheries","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Most cases of excessive preference for a larger family size are involved with environmental degradation in developing countries. Moreover, rural or indigenous people living in forest areas have a regular interaction with the environment. They usually depend on environmental resources for subsistence. The main objective of this study is to analyze indigenous people's perception of the relationship between environment and fertility. Out of the seven Khasia villages, the village called Lawachora Punji, with 23 households, was included in the field survey. The research findings reveal that environmental awareness is higher among women and the overall index is relatively low in the indigenous people regarding the environmental and demographic aspects. The overall environmental awareness index (EAI) indicates that people living in Lawachora National Park do not have a strong understanding of the impact of large family size on the environment. Grassroots level participation and gradual change of perception of large family size and dependence on forest resources are important to environmental sustainability in developing countries.

We initiated an in situ community-based conservation and research program from a captive population of T. kleinmanni. We used a captive population of the Egyptian tortoise to train a member of the local community as a research technician and used his indigenous tracking skills and knowledge of the area to collect activity and dietary data on 28 captive tortoises. We overcame problems with illiteracy by creating a data sheet based on symbols and numbers. This data sheet allowed us to use the indigenous knowledge of various people from the community, and employ them in the future. Our local community approach to data collection, in conjunction with a craft program, made the conservation of the Egyptian tortoise more rewarding to the local community by providing a more sustainable form of income than collecting animals for the pet trade. Our multidimensional approach (local community participation as research technicians, craft program, and trust building) for gaining local support eventually led to the rediscovery of wild Egyptian tortoises in North Sinai, which was significant, as this species was presumed extinct in Egypt. We have now shifted our focus to in situ conservation, using the research and local capacity building template developed from this captive population study. Our template can be used by zoos and conservation organizations with small budgets and collections of native species in natural habitats to create similar captive research programs that can be applied to in situ conservation.

Ideally, management decisions should be based upon scientific experiments that compare different methods. We therefore compared activity range and center estimates of the endangered Egyptian tortoise, Testudo kleinmanni, from data gathered by local people visually tracking tortoises and through the use of radio-tracking. Our results showed that although radio-tracking requires less effort, visually tracking tortoises can provide similar activity range (minimum convex polygon (MCP) and 95% kernel density (KD)) and activity center estimates (50% KD). Our study shows that conservation programs, with limited budgets, should hire local people to achieve both direct conservation action and carry out scientific studies to protect an endangered species. In addition, hiring local people increases conservation awareness in the greater community, is a source of pride because indigenous knowledge and skills are recognized, and provides financial opportunities to protect wildlife in an area in which the few economic opportunities often involve harvesting wildlife.

Nevertheless, the theoretical comparison between these concepts drawn from different epistemic approaches is lacking. Our aim is to interrelate resilience and patrimony concepts on the basis of a real example: the Agdal, a traditional forest management system in the Moroccan High Atlas. The role played by the Agdal in safeguarding the patterns of forest resource use by village communities from both external and internal conflicts, from natural hazards, and by securing a long- term supply of resource diversity is highlighted. This role shows the patrimonial character of the forest Agdal for the village communities and suggests an adaptive perspective. The patrimonial construction of the forest gives rise to management systems that allow a major place to experience social and environmental feedback, contributing to strengthened social-ecological system resilience and adaptability in the High Atlas Mountains. The notion of patrimony as a tool of resilience opens up a new interdisciplinary line of research.

As such, it could be used to assess sustainability of human development and equity in resource use. To facilitate the approach, tools are required at the level of detail at which policy and management decisions are made. We have developed spatially explicit models of indicators of important ecosystem services in New Zealand: regulation of climate, control of soil erosion, regulation of water flow (quantity), provision of clean water (quality), provision of food and fibre, and provision of natural habitat. The models were developed using lookup tables from process-based models to allow rapid evaluation of land-use scenarios. We demonstrate the application of the models to assess ecosystem services in a simulation of hill-country afforestation in the Manawatu catchment, which has recently seen increasing soil erosion in the hills leading to sedimentation of waterways. Each ecosystem service was assessed by calculating the change in the indicator relative to two extremes. The ecosystem services with the largest relative changes were control of soil erosion, carbon sequestration, and provision of wood.

Different strategies were used to study environmental perception, which included interviews with 80 villagers and participant observation. The interviews were performed using subjective and objective questions. No strong association between age or time of residence and conservationist ideas was observed. Similarly, these ideas are independent from the level of formal education or gender. The respondents have positive attitudes in relation to the environment and understand its importance; there is a powerful, link between them and the environment they live in. In spite of the positive attitudes shown by some villagers, there is a lack of essential information about the importance of the environment and its management. Therefore, there is the need to create environmental management and environmental educational programs, and these should consider community member values.","journal":"Interciencia","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

To this purpose we employ a system of equations. We use interactive terms to estimate separate slope coefficients for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, Central African countries, and rest of the world. The main results of our exercise can be summarised as follows: (i) a higher dependence on primary commodities reduces economic growth, increases income inequality, and slows down the rate of human capital accumulation; (ii) the negative effects of primary commodities on growth, inequality and human capital appear to be statistically stronger in Central Africa and SSA than in the rest of the world; (iii) in the case of growth and inequality, the negative effect of primary commodities and the differences of the slope coefficients across groups of countries persist after controlling for the quality of institutions; on the contrary (iv) in the case of human capital, the negative effect of primary commodities as well as the differences across groups of countries vanish once institutional development is controlled for. Two main policy recommendations stem from our analysis. First, the degree of dependence on primary commodities must be reduced through the diversification of productive structure in order to foster development. Second, a dynamic private sector is a key driver of diversification. Countries must therefore improve the business environment and strengthen financial intermediation to assist the expansion of the private sector.","journal":"L'Afrique Centrale peut-elle Ã©viter le piÃ¨ge de la malÃ©diction des produits de base?","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The concept of resilience offers a systematic framework for understanding the dynamics and variables that govern response dynamics of ecosystems. Resilience of haplochromine cichlids is assessed using limnological and biodiversity changes in Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake, over the last five decades. The review explores the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids using Holling's adaptive renewal cycle and attempts to illustrate how resilience-based management approaches might learn from an inadvertent management experiment. The introduction in the 1980s of the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a fecund and voracious predator of the endemic phytoplankton feeding haplochromine cichlids, anthropogenic eutrophication, and deep water hypoxia have combined in a synergistic way to increase the vulnerability of the lake ecosystem to perturbations that were hitherto absorbed. However, the upsurge in commercial Nile perch fishing appears to be enabling the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids. The resurgence of haplochromine cichlids is characterized by phenotypic plasticity, ecological and life history traits and demonstrates the critical role of response diversity in the maintenance of systems resilience. Resilience of the haplochromine cichlids resides in the requisite functional response diversity and habitat diversity that provide the resources for renewal and regeneration. This paper concludes that management of Nile perch fisheries and control of nutrient loading into Lake Victoria could halt or reverse eutrophication, hence offer the best promise for a diverse, productive, and resilient social-ecological system.

This paper argues that it is important to resolve tenure ambiguity and ensure that communities participate in the REDD+ process by engaging them in project development and implementation. Drawing on data collected in six villages under two REDD+ projects targeted in Cameroon, this paper addresses four questions: (1) What are the tenure conditions at the two study sites? (2) How have the project proponents perceived the tenure and other challenges and how do they plan to address those challenges? (3) What have the proponents done to engage communities in the process of establishing REDD+? (4) Are communities informed about and satisfied with the process of establishing REDD+? The paper shows that while the proponents have worked to resolve tenure issues and engage communities, there is still frustration among project participants because of a lack of progress toward implementing compensation and benefit sharing system. The paper concludes that it is crucial to safeguard the rights, access and participation of local communities, and benefits to them, throughout the design and implementation of REDD+ projects.

Traditional Ghanaians have a strong belief that some plants and animals have special spirits, which when cut (as in the case with plants) or killed (animals) can bring serious harm to the person. Thus, such plants and animals are not eliminated. This paper argues that sasa as an Akan indigenous conservation tool can complement the modern means of nature conservation in Ghana.

However, as success is rarely defined, what constitutes \"success\" is not clear. This paper reports an investigation into the way \"outsiders\" perceive success in Pacific island CCAs. An exploratory survey revealed six umbrella themes of success: the locus of control; local benefits; resource aspects; management; external stakeholder involvement; and sustainability. Multivariate analysis distinguished two groups, a Big picture group and a Locally focused group. These differ in how they define success, as well as their organizational alignment. The Big picture group, largely from funder agencies and international NGOs, were focused on the broad issues of success, especially the sustainability of CCAs. The Locally focused group was concerned with the practical workings and needs of successful CCAs in the Pacific; many in this group were based with Pacific island governments and NGOs or CCAs. The study concludes that success in CCAs should not be defined solely on project objectives, especially when these have been developed by an external entity or under their guidance. If they are, high rates of failure are to be expected.","journal":"Ecology and Society","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

In present times, the state has remained resolute and constitutes a strong and influential traditional authority in Ghana. The Okyeman traditional area is located in the Eastern Region of Ghana. It is endowed with rich natural resources including forest, mineral and water resources. In a survey to examine the socio-economic profile of the area and how traditional practices and taboos affect natural resource use, 426 respondents from 33 communities were randomly sampled and interviewed through questionnaire administration. The results of the analysis indicated that about 72% of the population was engaged in farming. The results also showed that traditional practices and taboos had played significant roles in natural resource management in the past, but being abandoned presently because of divergent beliefs. It was further revealed that rapid population growth from the 1960s to date and its associated production pressures was a major underlying factor in resource exploitation in the area. The activities of small-scale miners in particular were observed to be the major source of stream pollution and flow regime disturbance. The hitherto rich biodiversity of the area is at risk of being eroded if urgent steps are not taken to stop illegal activities in surrounding forest reserves. The study recommended the provision of alternative livelihood opportunities to the farming population to safeguard the rich forest resources and water bodies from further degradation.","journal":"West African Journal of Applied Ecology","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Using qualitative methodology we performed interviews with villagers and local organizations to assess the park's successes and failures from local stakeholders' perspectives. People living in a village with a permanent Madagascar National Parks (MNP) agent are more favorable to and supportive of the park conservation. People living in the park are supportive but are more divided. On the other hand, people living on the periphery of the park see conservation as more of a burden. Strategies like more equitable distribution of wealth, environment improvement and decentralization of power are discussed to achieve a more sustainable management plan based on community natural resources management.

Ideally, legislation regulating the use of natural resources should include provisions for the needs of both indigenous peoples and biodiversity. In reality, however, legislative weaknesses often exist and these can result in negative impacts, either on indigenous peoples' livelihoods, their surrounding biodiversity, or both. Here, our case study demonstrates why conservationists need to pay greater attention to natural resource legislation affecting indigenous peoples' rights. Apart from examining relevant laws for ambiguities that may negatively affect biodiversity and livelihoods of indigenous people in Peninsular Malaysia (known as the Orang Asli), we also provide supporting information on actual resource use based on questionnaire surveys. In order to address these ambiguities, we propose possible legislative reconciliation to encourage policy reform. Although there are positive examples of conservationists elsewhere adopting a more inclusive and participatory approach by considering the needs of indigenous peoples, greater recognition must be afforded to land and indigenous rights within natural resource laws for the benefit of indigenous peoples and biodiversity.

Combining and analyzing a unique set of long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on target species (Â±SE) was 5.13 Â± 1.9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated, took significantly longer (13.1 Â± 2.0 years). Most target species showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many target species continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from target species at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6.2 Â± 1.2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9.1 Â± 1.6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly targeted species were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

However, the level of forest use and the degree of reliance on forest environmental products differ across households. The factors that condition a household's economic reliance on a particular economic activity in general and on forest environmental resources in particular may vary depending on the resource endowment of the household, the household's demographic and economic characteristics, and exogenous factors such as markets, prices and technologies. This paper identifies the factors that condition a household's livelihood strategy choice with a particular focus on forest products. For this, we use the livelihood approach as a framework of analysis. Environmentally augmented household income data were collected from 360 sample households in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. On the basis of the share of forest environmental income in total household income, sample households were clustered into distinct livelihood strategies. Student's t-test and ANOVA were used to test income differences among the clusters. Multinomial logit (MNL) regression on asset-based explanatory variables was run to identify the main factors that determine households' livelihood strategy choice and forest dependence. The analyses indicate that differential access to, or endowment of, livelihood assets determines the choice of a household's strategy. Asset-poor households should be encouraged to engage in activities with higher economic return. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As most conventional household surveys do not incorporate income from environmental sources, substantial gaps exist in our understanding of the actual functioning of rural economies and the extent of rural poverty and inequality. Using data from 360 randomly sampled rural households from 12 villages in Tigray (northern Ethiopia), we measure forest environmental resource use with a monetary yardstick and compares the value of FEPs with other household economic activities. We found that products from environmental sources represent an important component in rural livelihoods. Our analyses indicate that in the study area income from forest environmental sources occupies the second largest share in average total household income next to crop income. Poverty and inequality analyses show that incorporating forest environmental incomes in household accounts significantly reduces measured rural poverty and income inequality. Therefore, we suggest that sustainable forest management schemes should be adopted to maintain and enhance the flow of economic benefits to the surrounding communities without damaging the natural resource system.

Furthermore, the poor grasp for the motivations underlying the fishers' behavior in their response to fisheries issues, policies, and regulations may have contributed to many failed fisheries management endeavors. This paper presents the results of a stated preference survey administered to 422 small-scale fishers in the coastal municipality of Talibon, Bohol of the Danajon Bank, Central Philippines, whereby fisheries management was likened to a commodity or good that satisfies the fishers' needs. The study tested specific attributes representing the economic, social, and ecological objectives of fisheries management that are likely to influence the fishers' attitudes towarda management strategy. The attitudes were elicited from the fishers' preference for a particular hypothetical management scenario over another in a series of choice games. A logistic model demonstrated high probabilities of choice when a management strategy promotes the increase in effort of fishing gear types perceived to be least harmful to the marine ecosystem, increases overall fisheries harvest, secures employment security for the majority, and increases the abundance of blue crabs - an important fisheries commodity in the Danajon Bank area. Key socio-economic and socio-civic characteristics of the fishers and their general knowledge, attitudes to, and perceptions of fisheries ecology concepts and fisheries management issues were likewise identified as probable determinants of choice and therefore behavior - such as acceptance or support - towardactual fisheries management policies.

K.; Aitken, S.","year":2010,"title":"Biological resources and poverty alleviation in the Indian Himalayas","dAbstract":"The Indian Himalaya is a vast landscape supporting a wide range of habitat diversity, from alpine meadows to tropical forests and cold deserts. Many plant species serve as important resources for the livelihood of local communities but in recent decades, over-exploitation of firewood, fodder, timber, food sources and medicinal plants has threatened their sustainable supply. For centuries, the sustainable use of biodiversity has been a well-proven tool for both biological conservation and the alleviation of poverty. This paper examines the use of wild biological resources such as medicinal plants, edibles, orchids, rhododendrons and ethnobiological knowledge packages for reducing poverty in the Indian Himalaya. It further compares biodiversity resources in the northwestern and northeastern parts of India, particularly the Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim states, with a wider interpretation for Himalaya as a whole. The two states are compared in their conservation approaches and use of resources. Various conservation approaches used by local people and/or governments are examined for their long-term viability Assessing populations of targeted species is essential before they should be used as resources, the ideal choice being the cultivation of high market-value taxa coupled with local entrepreneurship. Also discussed are sustainable strategies to multiply the resources and conserve the source gene bank in the wilderness. The role of civil society is recognized as an essential component of conservation management and with the help of scientific institutions stakeholders can develop the capacity to create bioresource-based entrepreneurships that also meet broader conservation and poverty reduction objectives. The threat of climate change to the availability of biodiversity is also discussed and a framework is presented for further action.","journal":"Biodiversity","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Door to door surveys were carried out, and using fixed response questionnaires people were interviewed to examine their views towards conservation and proposed alternatives to the forest resources for reducing biomass demand from the forest. The study revealed that in the area the concept of conservation of forests is well supported. Nevertheless, people are extracting biomass from the corridor forest for their sustenance. The dependence of the people on the forest is due to lack of alternatives to the forest resources, inability of the people to produce alternatives from market, and in some cases it is 'habitual' or 'traditional' In a situation where forest resources will not be available, people without any alternatives to forest resources are ready to agitate against such rules. People who oppose such decisions are not always dependent on the corridor forest but are antagonistic towards the forest department and want to use this opportunity to retaliate by stealing from the forest. The former category of people are the ones for whom income generating activities would be important while the later category should be the targets of extension programs designed to establish permanent lanes of dialogue with the forest department. To some extent human-animal conflict and apathetic attitude of the forest department are also responsible for antagonism of people.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Resource use has been restricted to the buffer zones, where it has been regulated, while core areas are completely closed. A 1991 amendment to the Wildlife Protection Act specifies that, in wildlife sanctuaries, the chief wildlife warden must certify that any manipulation does not harm wildlife, and that the manipulation be approved by the state government. The basic approach to management of PAs has been isolationist, based on the questionable assumption that certain areas are pristine or primary and that management must protect the park from people living in surrounding areas and shield wildlife and other natural resources from exploitation. This is achieved through the strict enforcement of legislation, patrols to prevent illegal activities and infrastructure maintenance. In this scenario, attempts to protect PAs from human intervention by coercion have often led to hostile attitudes of local people towards wildlife management and forestry staff, and sometimes to open conflict.","journal":"Unasylva","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Nevertheless, degradation of this ecosystem remains a matter of concern, emphasizing the fact that effective conservation of natural resources is possible only with an understanding of the attitudes and perceptions of local communities. In the present study, we examined the attitudes and perceptions of local communities towards mangrove forests through questionnaire surveys in 36 villages in the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area, India. The sample villages were selected from 336 villages using hierarchical cluster analysis. The study revealed that local communities in the area had positive attitudes towards conservation and that their demographic and socio-economic conditions influenced people's attitudes. Local communities valued those functions of mangrove forests that were directly linked to their wellbeing. Despite human-wildlife conflict, the attitudes of the local communities were not altogether negative, and they were willing to participate in mangrove restoration. People agreed to adopt alternative resources if access to forest resources were curtailed. Respondents living near the forests, who could not afford alternatives, admitted that they would resort to pilfering. Hence, increasing their livelihood options may reduce the pressure on mangrove forests. In contrast with other ecosystems, the linkages of mangrove ecosystem services with local livelihoods and security are direct and tangible. It is therefore possible to develop strong local support for sustainable management of mangrove forests in areas where a positive attitude towards mangrove conservation prevails. The current debates on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and payment for ecosystem services provide ample scope for development of sustainable livelihood options for local communities from the conservation of critical ecosystems such as mangroves.

When resource use in PAs is prohibited, the implications of the conflict are more severe for local women, who bear the burden of day-to-day survival.

Services provided by the Bhitarkanika mangrove ecosystem in India and estimated cyclone damage avoided in three selected villages, taking the cyclone of 1999 as a reference point, were valued by assessing the socio-economic status of the villages, the cyclone damage to houses, livestock, fisheries, trees and other assets owned by the people, and the level and duration of flooding. Eleven variables were used to compare damage in the villages, one protected by mangroves, one unprotected by mangroves, and the third possessing an embankment on its seaward side. Attitude surveys were carried out in 10% of the households in 35 villages located in the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area to assess local people's perceptions regarding the storm protection function of mangroves and their attitude towards mangrove forests generally. In the mangrove-protected village, variables had either the lowest values for adverse factors (such as damage to houses), or the highest values for positive factors (such as crop yield). The loss incurred per household was greatest (US$ 153.74) in the village that was not sheltered by mangroves but had an embankment, followed by the village that was neither in the shadow of mangroves or the embankment (US$ 44.02) and the village that was protected by mangrove forests (US$ 33.31).

This Chapter examines these tradeoffs through the interaction between Ghana's artisanal canoe fishery and the offshore trawler fishery. Ghana's marine biodiversity is threatened by a sizeable fishing industry partly because poverty is rife, and also because the coastal population has a high dependence on fish for their food security. The artisanal fishing fleet targets small pelagics, predominantly round sardinella (Sardinella aurita), with their catch used mainly for subsistence. By-catch in the trawler fleet, which includes round sardinella, is mainly consumed in urban areas within the country, while their target species are exported. Current artisanal sardinella catch is insufficient to meet subsistence needs, and therefore domestic reliance on trawl-caught sardinella for food security might be in conflict with the conservation of biodiversity. We develop a bioeconomic model, which illustrates that giving priority to the effective management of the artisanal fishery in Ghana could provide food and job security to the fishers of Ghana, without compromising biodiversity conservation, in contrast to the commercial trawl fishery. It appears that the sardinella fishery may be overcapitalized, as optimization results suggest effort could be cut in half while still providing catch levels of about 300,000 tonnes per year, or four times current artisanal catches. Limiting by-catch and spatial conflicts by the trawl fishery could yield economic benefits from the artisanal sector of over USS200 million over 20 years.","journal":"","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Local councils were instrumental in implementing this strategy in Sierra Leone and their dissolution in 1972 impacted negatively on local participation. Their reintroduction in 2004 was rushed, and desired outcomes are yet to be realised. The relative importance of stakeholders in the artisanal fisheries of Sierra Leone and that of governance attributes have been evaluated using the Analytical Hierarchy Process methodology under two scenarios (the current stewardship arrangement and a theoretical reformed system). The objective of the study is to elicit stakeholder's opinions on stewardship arrangement in order to evaluate attributes which may aid (or deter) governance thereby creating a baseline against which changes from governance reform can be measured. Results indicate that the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources currently wields disproportionate power over the stewardship of fisheries resources scoring the highest normalised geometric mean of 43% compared to about 20% reported for the University of Sierra Leone. The Ministry of Local Government scored 13.5% but all other stakeholders scored less than 10%. The Ministry of Fisheries saw a drop in its rating to about 24% under a reformed system whilst the Ministry of Local Government increased in stature to 17% as the University of Sierra Leone remained unchanged. Endowment attribute was the most dominant at 72% under the current system, but political and institutional attributes were more important with about 40 and 31% respectively under the reformed scenario (compared to 17% for endowment attribute). A receptive Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources sharing power and responsibility in a reformed system is sought. The communities perceive equity in the political and institutional governance attributes as the means of achieving equity in the endowment and economic attributes as the end. Reforms could only succeed in the spirit of the ministry's quest to effectively implement the fisheries policy by empowering and facilitating institutions best suited to carry out stewardship functions at the local level.

This paper argues for a context-driven approach whereby effective management requires inputs from both paradigms in different situations. A key element of context is understanding long-practiced resource tenures and their ability to meet future conservation and livelihood goals. Different types of tenure arrangements are often required for different resources. This approach is illustrated by analysis of Virachey National Park in NE Cambodia. This park encompasses part of the ancestral territory of ethnic Brao people, who rely upon swidden agriculture, fish, terrestrial wildlife, and various nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for their livelihoods. These people have developed a mix of resource tenure regimes to promote sustainable use and to maximize local benefits. In the face of contemporary pressures, some of these traditional approaches are effective, while others are not. The paper suggests avenues for building on long-established management practices of the Brao to achieve park management goals while enhancing the welfare of the Brao people. A mix of private ownership, common property management, and central government involvement may be required to maximize benefits to local people and ensure long-term protection of biodiversity.","journal":"Environmental Management","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Increasing pressures from human exploitation and habitat disturbance, however, have raised serious concerns about the potential depletion of various species. This has led to the establishment of large numbers of Fish Conservation Zones (FCZs) or \"no-take\" fish sanctuaries in southern Laos based on a \"community-based fisheries co-management\" framework. This study uses the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers to assess the effectiveness of village-managed FCZs in enhancing fish stocks in the mainstream Mekong River in Khong District, Champasak Province. Focus group interviews about species that are believed to have benefited from different FCZs are compared with parameters such as FCZ area, age, depth, localized gradient, water velocity, and the presence of wetland forests nearby. The results suggest that no one aspect is likely to account for variations in fish stocks; rather, it is the interaction between numerous factors that has the largest impact. Secondly, the results indicate that microhabitat diversity and protection are critical for maintaining and enhancing Mekong fisheries. Deep-water pools are particularly important as dry season refuges for many fish species, and FCZ depth may be the single most important environmental factor affecting the success of FCZs in the Mekong River. FCZs have the most potential to benefit relatively sedentary species, but may also benefit highly migratory species, given the right conditions. This study shows that integrated approaches to stock assessment that employ LEK and scientific fisheries management have considerable potential for improving Mekong capture-fisheries management.

W.","year":2013,"title":"Conservation as disturbance: Upheaval and livelihood diversification near Tarangire National Park, northern Tanzania","dAbstract":"Recent studies have identified poverty reduction near parks and protected areas, findings that challenge an extensive literature on the social burdens associated with protected areas. These studies move the discussion on the social dynamics of conservation forward, however, they do not offer insight into the underlying mechanisms that shape household-level outcomes such as income and wealth. By focusing on protected areas as centers of uncertainty, upheaval, and disturbance, this study examines the character and incidence of livelihood diversification within communities near Tarangire National Park in northern Tanzania compared to communities far from the park. Livelihood diversification is well understood as a coping and/or risk mitigation strategy pursued in response to various types of shocks, and uncertainty more generally. This study draws on mixed methodologies to construct multivariate statistical models to estimate the effect of proximity to the park on measures of livelihood diversification. The results indicate that proximity to park is strongly correlated with livelihood diversification, suggesting that households near the park are adapting to opportunities and constraints and may be seeking to reduce variance in income and wealth in response to disturbances and uncertainty associated with the park.

{"author":"Baker, E. K.; Harris, P. T.","year":2012,"title":"Habitat Mapping and Marine Management","dAbstract":"Marine habitat mapping provides the spatial framework for ecosystem-based management (EBM). Its increasing prominence, in international policy and regional and national management organizations, highlights its growing acceptance especially as a tool for designing and delineating MPAs. The management priorities of protecting biodiversity and developing sustainable use solutions, while managing stakeholder expectations and avoiding competing use conflicts need to be implemented with the use of credible scientific information. At present, the majority of human activities are still localized within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of coastal states and are therefore managed by local, regional, or national bodies under the governance of the sovereign state. Often, numerous organizations are involved, each responsible for a sector, activity, or location. Demands are being made of the marine environment that threaten to erode the natural, social, and economic benefits that human society derives from the oceans. Expanding populations ensure a continuing increase in the variety and complexity of marine-based activities-fishing, power generation, tourism, mineral extraction, and shipping. The two most commonly acknowledged purposes for habitat mapping in the case studies contained in this chapter are to support government spatial marine planning, management, and decision making; and to support and underpin the design of marine protected areas. A more holistic management approach is advocated, one that considers the interaction between people and the environment and the resultant impact on ecosystem function and resilience, rather than managing one issue or resource in isolation.

This limits opportunities to identify strategies that reduce conflict and the magnitude of resulting threats to conservation. Integrated conservation and development (ICD) was adopted at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, to reduce conflict during gazettement of the national park, but the success of this approach remains contested. We retrieved documents of conflict written by park staff and local people from 1986 through 2000 (before, during, and after gazettement). We extracted data on 48 incidences of violent conflict and categorized them by gazettement period, area, instigator, and type to undertake a historical analysis of the triggers of violent conflict at Bwindi. Before and during gazettement, local villagers instigated most of the conflict incidents when law-enforcement efforts sought to halt commercial activities within Bwindi. No conflict arose from the arrest of villagers collecting subsistence resources during these periods. After gazettement, prohibitions on commercial activities continued to drive conflict even though villagers collecting subsistence resources were arrested more frequently than before gazettement, and local attitudes toward the park had improved following receipt of ICD benefits. Law-enforcement efforts targeted commercial activities to reduce this threat to Bwindi's mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), although the activities remained important income sources for people in villages near Bwindi. Losing commercial income following gazettement therefore appeared to be their primary motivation for instigating conflict with park rangers. Prohibitions on subsistence resource use triggered conflict less often. Our use of typologies for a multivariate conflict analysis demonstrates that by identifying differences between effects of conservation as drivers of conflict, conflict analysis can enable a more strategic deployment of conflict-resolution measures that could further conservation efforts. At Bwindi targeting ICD toward individuals who lost benefits from commercial activities may strengthen the role of ICD in conflict resolution and conservation.

The forests of the district harbour a large population of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). The combined effects of high elephant density and major landscape changes due to the expansion of coffee cultivation are the cause of human-elephant conflicts (HEC). Mitigation strategies, including electric fences and compensation schemes implemented by the Forest Department have met with limited success. Building on previous studies in the area, we assessed current spatial and temporal trends of conflict, analysed local stakeholders' perceptions and identified factors driving elephants into the estates. Our study, initiated in May 2007, shows that the intensity of HEC has increased over the last 10 years, exhibiting new seasonal patterns. Conflict maps and the lack of correlation between physical features of the coffee plantations and elephant visits suggest elephants move along corridors between the eastern and western forests of the district, opportunistically foraging when crossing the plantations. Dung analyses indicate elephants have selectively included ripe coffee berries in their diet. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of wild elephants feeding on coffee berries. If this new behaviour spreads through the population, it will compound an already severe conflict situation. The behavioural plasticity, the multiplicity of stakeholders involved, the difficulty in defining the problem and the limits of technical solutions already proposed suggest that HEC in Kodagu has the ingredients of a \"wicked\" problem whose resolution will require more shared understanding and problem solving work amongst the stakeholders.

E.","year":1992,"title":"WILDLIFE UTILIZATION AND LOCAL PEOPLE - A CASE-STUDY IN UPPER LUPANDE GAME MANAGEMENT AREA, ZAMBIA","dAbstract":"Wildlife culling is the most preferred form of wildlife utilization in ULGMA. Nevertheless, die frequency of game-meat consumption by local people is low, partly due to the problem of irregular meat sales from the culling scheme and partly due to the low purchasing capability of villagers. LIRDP needs to improve the distribution routine of meat sale at lower prices if the culling scheme is to fulfil its objective of providing game-meat to local people. It is also essential to spread comprehension of the use of benefits from wildlife utilization among the local residents. Any increase in the allocation of the wildlife harvest quota should be considered with caution in order that species are not harvested at a rate beyond their reproductive capacity. There is resentment against safari hunting, based on the opinion that it gives to foreigners the opportunities to utilize wildlife resources while the local people are forbidden access to them. Appreciation of benefits from safari hunting is minimal, and option for reduction of the off-take allocation quota is strong. Although safari hunting is the most prominent revenue-generating form of utilization, benefits from it are not visible to local communities. Exchange of information between LIRDP and the local communities concerned with the use of revenue from wildlife utilization programmes needs to be reinforced. This would be instrumental not only in minimizing misconceptions about safari hunting, but also in establishing cooperation between LIRDP and local communities. An increase in the number that may be taken of the more numerous species during DGL hunting could well be considered, so as to enable more local people to utilize wildlife resources legally. Control shooting has a marginal effect in reducing crop damage. Even though electric fencing could be an effective barrier against large animals such as Elephants, it would be better to encourage traditional methods of self-defence. Control shooting is advocated only if and when the problem gets out of hand. Subsistence poaching is widely successful, due to the skills of the practitioners, the use of appropriate traditional technology, and the low operating costs. These features may be considered favourably in wildlife culling operations. Through allocation of a sustainable off-take quota to local hunter cooperatives, their services could be used to provide game-meat to local communities. Continued confrontation with commercial poachers through regular and more intensive patrols is essential, particularly in vulnerable areas. LIRDP should maximize the services of Village Scouts stationed at Miliyoti and Kauluzi wildlife camps by providing adequate firearms and ammunition for more effective anti-poaching patrols in the game management areas than currently exist. To gain local support, LIRDP may consider an increased wildlife off-take quota for the Malaila Kunda traditional ceremony. This would serve to sustain local culture and would help to develop enthusiasm among local people for due conservation of animal wildlife and other natural resources.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Free-ranging European bison have existed in this area for 40Â years, inhabiting a suboptimal habitat characterized by intensive agriculture and fragmented forests. Despite 85.0Â % of respondents reporting positive attitudes towards bison presence, 47.4Â % of respondents considered the animals acceptable only if they were not closer than 10Â km from their residence. Over 60Â % of respondents suggested increasing the numbers of bison in the country, and 51Â % suggested letting them live freely in the wild. The most negative attitude towards an increase in numbers was shown by women, respondents with lower knowledge of the species and inhabitants of biggest settlements. Public awareness relating to the European bison is lacking, as nearly 50Â % of persons residing near areas inhabited by bison did not know about their presence. We conclude that, despite the high valuation placed upon the bison by the public and the ability of the bison to survive in open agrolandscapes with fragmented forests, negative public opinion may be a factor limiting the social carrying capacity for the species. Lithuanian human dimensions of this species should be taken into account when introducing the European bison elsewhere in Western Europe.

Here we study the views of landowners and agrarian communities (ejidos) from central Jalisco in Mexico to identify characteristics that payment for environmental services (PES) programs conserving/enhancing forest cover could include in their design. A choice experiment was applied to 161 landowners and ejido-landowners. Results show that importance and dependency on cash payments can decrease if interventions to promote local development through improved health and education services and generation of employment and productive projects are included. Responses indicate that communal forested areas in ejidos would be most likely to enroll into PES. In some cases grasslands could be afforested. Agroforestry practices providing other environmental services could also be implemented (e.g. windbreaks). Potential enrollment is lower in agricultural and peri-urban areas due to higher opportunity costs. Higher payments favor enrollment but may compromise the program's efficiency since aggregated cash-flow over long periods can exceed the present value of the land itself in some areas. Offering a mix of cash and non-cash benefits based on local developmental needs might be the best way to promote participation in PES.

Since then, the development of both ICM and MPAs have benefited from a number of factors that include devolution of management authority to local government, continued active engagement of local non-government organizations, strong support from the national government and from marine science academic and research institutions, and the influx of donor-assisted marine conservation programs in the past two decades. ICM and MPA programs in the Philippines implement a variety of components that include community organizing, participatory planning, alternative livelihood development, public education, research, regulating resource uses, and policy development that address various marine conservation issues. The unabated degradation of the marine environment and its resources continue to motivate efforts to improve the existing paradigm of community-based resource management and MPA establishment, which are carried out in various adaptations depending on the issues addressed and the socio-political context in which the initiatives are taking place. A number of recommendations are put forth in addressing the problems and obstacles faced by ICM and MPA initiatives and in improving their effectiveness for consideration by local practitioners and decision-makers.

Twenty-eight transects were sampled in order to know the census and geographic distribution. The study area is characterized by flooded alluvial valleys, wetlands, swamps, with a hot climate and yearly dry and rainy seasons. It was found a population of more than 10 000 individuals in Department of CÃ³rdoba inhabiting isolated swamps and permanent lagoons. The greatest concentration was found along RÃ­o SinÃº with 7995 individuals. The size of the streams, swamps and some permanent lagoons determine the extension of the habitat of Lesser Capybara; however, it depends more on the farmers and administrators attitude, than on the conditions of the habitat. The census of 1272 individuals was based on 103 herds with an average frecuency of 3.83 Â±10.69 indiv/Km, with no statistical differences among watersheds (p=0.6905). There were no differences in the size of the herds among watersheds (p=0.0749), with an average of 4.89 Â±8.35 indiv/heard. A high index for all the subregions in the Department of CÃ³rdoba was found. Threat values varied from 48.1 to 65.5 with no statistical differences among watersheds (p=0.1173).

This apparent paradox has been highlighted by a recent study showing that on a per capita basis, visits to natural areas in the United States and Japan have declined over the last two decades. These results have been cited as evidence of \"a fundamental and pervasive shift away from nature-based recreation\" - but how widespread is this phenomenon? We address this question by looking at temporal trends in visitor numbers at 280 protected areas (PAs) from 20 countries. This more geographically representative dataset shows that while PA visitation (whether measured as total or per capita visit numbers) is indeed declining in the United States and Japan, it is generally increasing elsewhere. Total visit numbers are growing in 15 of the 20 countries for which we could get data, with the median national rate of change unrelated to the national rate of population growth but negatively associated with wealth. Reasons for this reversal of growth in the richest countries are difficult to pin down with existing data, but the pattern is mirrored by trends in international tourist arrivals as a whole and so may not necessarily be caused by disaffection with nature. Irrespective of the explanation, it is clear that despite important downturns in some countries, nature-related tourism is far from declining everywhere, and may still have considerable potential both to generate funds for conservation and to shape people's attitudes to the environment.

Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious. Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures ('insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.

Most often communities suffer due to predation on their stock while large carnivores suffer losses and at times extirpation due to retaliation. We examine the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) and pastoral communities (Maldharis) in the Gir forests, India. We monitored six Maldhari settlements between 2005 and 2007 to quantify seasonal livestock holding, density and losses due to predation and other causes. Lion density, estimated by mark recapture, was 15Â±0.1 SE/100 km2. Livestock density, estimated by total counts, ranged between 25/km2-31/km2 with buffaloes being most abundant. Average livestock holding of Maldhari families was 33Â±3 SE. Lions predated mostly on unproductive cattle (30%). Scat analysis (n = 165), predation events (n = 180) and seven continuous monitoring sessions of 1,798 hours on four radio-collared lions estimated livestock to contribute between 25 to 42% of lions' biomass consumptions, of which only 16% was predated; rest scavenged. With free grazing rights within Gir forests, Maldharis offset 58Â±0.2 SE% of annual livestock rearing cost in comparison to non-forest dwelling pastoralists. With government compensation scheme for livestock predation, this profit margin augmented to 76Â±0.05 SE%. Lion density was higher in areas with Maldhari livestock in comparison to areas without livestock. Thus, the current lifestyles and livestock holdings of Maldharis seem to be beneficial to both lions and local pastoralists. We conclude that a combination of strict protection regime for lions, Maldharis' traditional reverence towards lions and the livelihood economics permit the delicate balance of lion-Maldhari coexistence. Indefinite increase in human and livestock population within Gir might upset this equilibrium undermining the conservation objectives. We see no end to compensation programs worldwide as they constitute a crucial element needed for human-carnivore coexistence.

People holding an executive position and those without it have conflicting views on the provisions of power sharing and access to information and resources. There are differences in perceiving and evaluating different qualities of information at various levels of policy processes, and what higher policy makers might think is important quality of information for community forest user groups may no longer be valued by the users.

About 90% of households reared one or more types of livestock while the mean Livestock Size Unit was 3.32 per household. Livestock diseases and ailments were common and usually treated with diclofenac. Livestock carcass disposal practices were favourable to vultures because 60% of households dumped carcasses in open fields. Diclofenac is lethal to vultures; 3% of diclofenac-contaminated carcasses were available annually. The majority (78%) of respondents had favourable attitudes towards the concept of vulture conservation.

The benefits of participation outweighed the costs based on respondents' estimates. The performance of grassroots organizations and levels of participation were correlated.

To address the hypothesis that conservation attitudes should improve around protected areas (PAs) with more social and economic interventions, stratified random questionnaire surveys of 234 households were conducted in two PAs in the Western Terai of Nepal: Bardia National Park (BNP), in which interventions have been more widespread for longer time periods, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (SWR), in which interventions are relatively recent. Both are part of a major landscape-level conservation programme under implementation in Nepal, and both are under threat of political turmoil, uncontrolled immigration, inefficient land reform policies and unsustainable resource use. There was spatio-temporal variability in resource use patterns and dependence. People collected eight and seven types of resources in BNP and SWR, respectively, and people in BNP were more dependent on resources overall. About 72% of respondents mentioned the problem of inadequate firewood, and suggested the promotion of alternative energy and permission to collect from PAs as mitigating strategies. Of 11 attitude statements, five significantly differed between the two areas. Respondents from the BNP had more favourable attitudes about conservation than those from SWR, supporting the main hypothesis. Training received by respondents, damage by wildlife, dependence on resources and satisfaction towards user groups contributed significantly to the variation in conservation attitudes. The results suggest that the liberalization of PA management has enabled the use of resources, improved livelihoods to some extent and solicited more favourable conservation attitudes in Nepal.

This paper explores the potential of local communities to be the primary actor in the governance of the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) following its planned handover to them in 2012. In doing so, the paper serves as an important baseline from which to monitor a new experiment in protected area governance. During the summer of 2007, the executive members and implementing staff of the Conservation Area Management Committees (CAMCs) were interviewed and local villagers surveyed. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected to assess the CAMCs capacities to manage ACA without outside support. All CAMCs had more than a decade of managerial experience and considerable local support. Villagers largely considered the CAMCs as legitimate institutions, and their executive members as trustworthy. CAMC members were confident about assuming management responsibility of the area. The devolution of power to an overarching local council to govern ACA will present some challenges, especially with regard to lower-performing CAMCs. However, key factors identified in the literature as critical to good governance portend positive prospects for the transition.

Nepal's two CAs are administered by a nongovernmental organization (NGO), and all of its CFs are administered by a government agency (GA). The goal of this research is to compare and contrast these two models using quantitative and qualitative data collected through field research in the Annapurna Conservation Area in the summer of 2007 and adjacent CFs in the fall of 2008. The Conservation Area Management Committee (CAMC) and the Community Forest User Committee (CFUC) are the functional decision-making entities at the local level in CAs and CFs, respectively. We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 66 executive members of 10 CAMCs and 67 members of 9 CFUCs. While both models appear to have performed well overall, the CA under the direction of the NGO appears to have fared better with regard to (i) developing trust of local constituencies, (ii) garnering favorable attitudes among villagers, (iii) building capacity of executive members, and (iv) improving standards of living. We suggest that the particular accountabilities associated with NGOs may situate them in a better position to cultivate local governance than state entities on their own.

However, beyond production, trade-offs between household income, food security or environmental protection were also identified during the model development process. Subsequently, the BayFish-Bac Lieu model allows detailing of: (i) annual production probabilities in the case of a baseline scenario; (ii) outcomes of four different sluice gate operation modes; and (iii) trade-offs between household income, food security and environment outcomes for each scenario. The model shows that through improved shrimp farming and fish production, total household income benefits directly from open sluice gates allowing saline intrusion. However, this has the opposite effect on rice production, and on food security. Results suggest that a suitable compromise involving at least one sluice gate open at all times should be adopted for optimized outcomes.

B.","year":2006,"title":"Mangrove dependency and the livelihoods of coastal communities in Thailand","dAbstract":"From 1961 to 1996, Thailand lost 50-60% of its mangrove forests, mainly because of conversion to shrimp aquaculture. The speed and scale of deforestation have affected many coastal communities. This chapter highlights the importance of mangroves to four case study villages. Households depend directly on mangrove forests for fish and wood collection and/or benefit indirectly from the mangroves' support to coastal fisheries. Mangrove loss therefore affects the decision of households to look for outside employment. In response to deforestation, female household members allocate more hours to employment relative to mangrove-dependent activities, whereas males allocate fewer hours to outside work. Awareness of community conservation efforts and of the environmental damage imposed by shrimp farms also motivates households to participate in replanting activities. Efforts to control mangrove deforestation and promote community-based management of remaining mangrove forests, as well as replanting, would help to mitigate some of the worst impacts on coastal villages. By developing institutions to support local community management, the government of Thailand could help avoid excessive mangrove deforestation and conflicts over uses. Such a framework could also provide important lessons in coastal resource management for other countries in South-east Asia and elsewhere.

Opportunities for conserving agrobiodiversity in situ could offer solutions to these concerns within regions marginal for agricultural production. Key stakeholders in the process of on-farm conservation in Switzerland, Turkey and Nepal were interviewed to gather their perceptions of the methods that could be applied for diversity conservation in the margins. It is argued that the appropriate application of in situ conservation approaches offer opportunities for sustaining diversity, particularly where productivity increases are likely to have minimal impacts on the profitability of agricultural activities. A human ecology paradigm, alternative to the dominant neo-classical approach, could focus primarily on issues of socio-ecological sustainability by ensuring that development supports local diversity.

Ostensibly small differences in wealth, among families and through the life cycle, are often overlooked; however, they can make a difference in the opportunities available to households and give rise to considerable diversity and specialization in economic livelihood among forest people. Indeed, wealth may be the key to unlocking the logic of the diversity seen in forest product extraction among forest people. This argument is illustrated by the findings from an ongoing study of rain forest use in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve area of the Peruvian Amazon, one of the largest and most biodiverse forest reserves in Latin America. The authors conclude that initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable resource use and poverty alleviation among rain forest peoples could improve their efficacy by giving greater attention to the role of wealth in income generation and by seeking ways to improve the prospects and paths for wealth accumulation of forest peasant households.","journal":"Unasylva","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

A randomly distributed questionnaire indicated that 94% of fishers believed that without the MIMP, there would be overfishing, dynamite use, destroyed habitats, and few fish. Fishers were more positive about core zones (no-take fishery closures) than general use zones (areas allowing selective fishing) as a consequence of increases in fishing pressure. Those that reported increased catches and sizes of fish since the creation of the MIMP were more likely to agree with present zone locations and more positive in general about fisheries and conservation planning. Most thought that fish size and gear restrictions were preferable to permanent closures. Perceptions differed among communities and gear users. Community and gear type explained 46% of the variance in responses about the perception that fisheries and conservation are compatible goals. Somewhat surprisingly, these effects were more important than catch increases or involvement in MIMP-related activities. The differences in perception between communities may be partly attributed to different fishing histories. Multiple-use zoning provides a means to identify and resolve conflicts and achieve what are likely universal objectives for fisheries sustainability and conservation.

Systematic conservation planning has been applied to terrestrial and marine systems for over a decade, but only recently been used for freshwaters. Of the various methods proposed, those that explicitly include the costs of, opportunities for and constraints on conservation actions are the most defensible because they allow transparent, rational decisions to be made about conservation priorities. 2. Applying these procedures to freshwater systems presents a number of challenges, including accounting for lateral, longitudinal and vertical connections, and the dynamism and resilience of freshwaters in space and time. Recent research on freshwater conservation planning contains an array of methods to address these issues. 3. The first step in bridging the implementation gap will be to communicate that conserving aquatic biodiversity often will not be achieved by merely 'locking up' catchments and that many human uses can coexist with biodiversity conservation. 4. To bridge the gap between research and implementation, terrestrial experience suggests that genuinely collaborative involvement with stakeholders and managers needs to be part of the planning process. Otherwise, even the most transparently optimised conservation plan will be ignored. 5. Case studies explored by the advocates of social learning and 'resilience thinking' provide frameworks for creative engagement between the ecological and social sciences. There is probably scope to modify existing catchment management networks to incorporate aquatic biodiversity conservation.

In this study, we take a novel approach by characterizing post-landing trends of small-scale fisheries resources and estimating their total economic value, including both commercial and subsistence values, in a remote rural region in Madagascar. We construct annual landings and characterize gear and habitat use, post-landing trends, fishing revenue, total market value, costs and net income, profitability, employment and dependence on small-scale fisheries. Our results show that the small-scale fisheries sector employs 87% of the adult population, generates an average of 82% of all household income, and provides the sole protein source in 99% of all household meals with protein. In 2010 an estimated 5524. metric tons (t) of fish and invertebrates were extracted annually by small-scale fishers in the region, primarily from coral reef ecosystems, of which 83% was sold commercially, generating fishing revenues of nearly $6.0 million (PPP, 2010). When accounting for subsistence catch, total annual landings had an estimated value of $6.9 million (PPP, 2010). Our results demonstrate the importance of small-scale fisheries for food security, livelihoods, and wealth generation for coastal communities, and highlight the need for long-term management strategies that aim to enhance their ecological and economic sustainability. Our findings should catalyze national and regional policy makers to re-examine existing fisheries policies that neglect this sector, and spur researchers to better quantify small-scale fisheries globally.

The Great Fluvial region, 3725 km long, shows richness of natural resources and has a developing economy based on forestry and agriculture, The La Plata River (RÃ­o de la Plata) region, with a 392 km waterfront, is the most densely populated, urbanized, industrialized area in the country, and it also exhibits high levels of environmental degradation. The Pampean (Pampeana) and the Patagonian (PatagÃ³nica) regions have a 4725 km litoral They hold important fishery stocks, the largest of which (the hake) is currently overexploited. Tourism demand has caused urban landscape to progress in the Pampa coast during the last three decades. In Patagonia, most of the natural resources are well preserved but the territorial and economic integration is still delayed. Despite the environmental and socioeconomic differences among the four regions, there is, however, a common set of problems which, to a greater or lesser extent, affect them all: (a) privatization of the public domain; (b) inadequate urban planning of the coastal zone; (c) industrial and urban pollution; (d) coastal erosion linked to inadequate coastal management practices; (e) overexploitation of natural resources; (f) loss and fragmentation of natural habitats leading to the loss of biodiversity; (g) increased coastal vulnerability. According to this diagnosis, coordinated specific, long-term actions should be promoted. Even when Argentina has a wide range of environmental legislation, it lacks a single tool or instrument specifically designed for coastal management. Most of the regulations and administrative requirements applied to the current coastal zone management are general normatives, and thus diffuse or hardly suitable for specific situations. We propose to attain consensus about a minimal preliminary basis in order to develop a national integrated management coastal program. Some of the issues are: design of specific governmental policies; creation of a specific institutional organization; long-term funding for the program; promotion of inter-institutional coordination and public participation in the decision-making process; development of specific research, education, training and information generation; and promotion of international cooperation aimed at sharing experiences in coastal zone management.","journal":"Coastal Management","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Noting this striking correlation between drought vulnerability and the prevalence of maize as a staple food, a growing array of agencies in Zambia has begun introducing highly productive new cassava varieties, developed in the north, to more central and southerly regions in an effort to provide low-cost food security during drought years. Yet agro ecological conditions in these drought-prone regions differ significantly from the northern research stations where Zambian scientists developed the new cassava varieties. So it is not clear that the varieties or management practices that work well in the north will prove optimal in other regions. In order to assist farmers and agencies interested in expanding cassava as a food security crop in central Zambia, we have conducted cassava trials in central Zambia over the past three years. Concurrently, we have engaged in regular on-farm discussions with early adopting farmers. Results from these investigations suggest that, with some modification of management practices recommended in the north, many of the new cassava clones offer a feasible means of mitigating lean season hunger and providing low-cost, in-kind drought insurance for rural households in central Zambia.","journal":"Agrekon","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Compounding the situation, high poverty indices occur together with the degradation of natural resources, infant malnutrition, social inequity, and a downward development spiral. Communities in these areas produce various food crops, however, these production activities degrade soil and water resources and contribute to deforestation and loss of biodiversity. This article summarizes and describes a process of adaptive watershed management which contributes to sustainable development in the Chimbo River sub-watershed. The process begins with technical studies of the state of soil resources, water, and biodiversity in the sub-watershed with the intent of designing a plan to modify production systems by incorporating more environmentally friendly practices. Challenges for watershed management are described. The conceptual framework, empirical strategy, and final results are presented which show how implementation of better practices for natural resource management and food production contribute to reducing environmental vulnerability and improvement in the welfare of local farm families in the watershed.","journal":"Conference Proceedings","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

After briefly reviewing opposite views on the land degradation issue in the regional context of the PÃ¡tzcuaro lake basin, the paper focuses on land management at local level. The indigenous concept of land is discussed as an integrated whole, including water cycle, climate, relief and soils. Indigenous people venerate land as the mother of all living beings, including humans. Therefore, people's health and survival require good land care and management. Local knowledge on land management is organized around four basic principles: land position, land behaviour, land resilience and land quality. Farmers recognize land as it dynamic subject, a concept reflected in the expression 'land moves and behaves', Soil erosion and fertility depletion are perceived as 'normal' processes the farmers control by means of integrated management practices. Farmers recognize several land classes, primarily controlled by landscape position, which require different land care. The example of San Francisco PichÃ¡taro demonstrates that traditional agriculture does not necessarily lead to land degradation. But the collective knowledge, or social theory, on land management is increasingly exposed to be fragmented as the community undergoes structural changes and loses its social cohesion under the pressure of externalities such as off-farm activities, out-migrations and governmental intervention, among others.","journal":"Geografiska Annaler, Series A: Physical Geography","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Irrigated terrace agriculture is an important part of livelihood strategies in the areas studied and has the potential to be more productive and sustainable. In some areas it is reported to be endangered by socioeconomic changes and highland land degradation caused by excessive shifting cultivation, sheep and goat grazing, and charcoal production. Field visits made during summer 1998 to establish the condition of irrigated terrace and runoff agriculture and the factors affecting it showed that in at least one of the villages supportive social capital has ensured that challenges are being met and beneficial innovations are being made. Considerable variation in success was evident from community to community, with some farmers maintaining adequate lifestyles and innovating, while in other communities prospects are less promising. The effects of structural adjustment have clearly been felt and may also have triggered some of the highland degradation and difficulties, which clearly threaten some irrigated terrace agriculture and other livelihood practices.

Such rights center around the dry season fodder resources, especially of Acacia tortilis. However they are not definite and are linked to risk-spreading by flexibility in livestock management and the need that they be maintained through efficient usage and social linkages. Hitherto, such natural resource management systems have all but been ignored in the development process in favor of the \"tragedy of the commons\" paradigm. Likewise, pastoral development has tended to emphasize range and water, while trees are not given the attention they deserve.

Community conserved areas that are periodically harvested are increasingly being implemented as fisheries management tools, but few researchers have empirically compared them with permanently closed reserves. We used a hierarchal control-impact experimental design to compare the abundance and biomass of reef fishes, invertebrates, and substrate composition in periodically harvested and permanent reserves and in openly fished (control sites) of the South Pacific island country of Vanuatu. Fished species had significantly higher biomass in periodically harvested reserves than in adjacent openly fished areas. We did not detect differences in substratum composition between permanent reserves and openly fished areas or between permanent reserves and periodically harvested reserves. Giant clams (tridacnids) and top shells (Trochus niloticus) were vulnerable to periodic harvest, and we suggest that for adequate management of these species, periodically harvested community conservation areas be used in conjunction with other management strategies. Periodic harvest within reserves is an example of adaptive and flexible management that may meet conservation goals and that is suited to the social, economic, and cultural contexts of many coastal communities in the developing world.

Protection may also alter community responses to long-term climate change by offering habitat for range-shifting species. Here we analyse the species richness, diversity and functional traits of temperate reef fish communities over 20 years in a global warming hotspot and compare patterns in a marine reserve with nearby sites open to fishing. Species richness and diversity oscillated strongly on the decadal scale. Long-term warming signatures were also present as increasing functional trait richness and functional diversity, driven in part by a general increase in herbivores. Nevertheless, reserve sites were distinguished from fished sites by displaying: greater stability in some aspects of biodiversity; recovery of large-bodied temperate species; resistance to colonization by subtropical vagrants; and less pronounced increases in the community-averaged temperature affinity. We empirically demonstrate that protection from fishing has buffered fluctuations in biodiversity and provided resistance to the initial stages of tropicalization.

The results show that in the absence of formal resource management schemes, cooperative members adopt self-management strategies to protect their resource base only if the sustainability of their livelihood is seriously threatened. There is no impediment to female cooperative members (62%) participating in resource management. The factors that positively influenced members' participation were the number of children, perceived fishery conditions, awareness of mangrove conservation and rehabilitation, and assessment of enforcement of the ban on dynamite and cyanide fishing. Fishing cooperatives, however, fail as a source of information on regulation and conservation education of members.

Fishers, represented by the Fishermen's Association of Malalison Island (FAMI) who form the core group, participated actively in the management of fishery resources with legal and financial support both from the municipal and barangay (village) government. Potential problems nonetheless, still exist with the ambivalent attitude of fishers toward rule-breaking, especially of fishery rules directly affecting them. The future of co-management arrangements will largely depend on how the fishers and other stakeholders maintain and build earlier initiatives with the eventual phasing out of SEAFDEC AQD from the island. The rapid population growth could also affect project gains.","journal":"International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Over the past 30. years rapid land use change in this area has substantially reduced wildlife habitat. Tsetse control operations are often blamed for this. In this study, we quantify this change for the Dande Communal Area, Mbire District, of the Mid-Zambezi Valley and analyse the contribution of three major potential drivers: (1) increase in human population; (2) increase in cattle population (and the expansion of associated plough-based agriculture), and; (3) expansion of cotton farming. Although direct effects of land use change on wildlife densities could not be proven, our study suggests that the consequences for elephant and buffalo numbers are negative. All three of the above drivers have contributed to the observed land use change. However, we found farmland to have expanded faster than the human population, and to have followed a similar rate of expansion in cattle sparse, tsetse infested areas as in tsetse free areas where cattle-drawn plough agriculture dominates. This implies the existence of a paramount driver, which we demonstrate to be cotton farming. Contrary to common belief, we argue that tsetse control was not the major trigger behind the dramatic land use change observed, but merely alleviated a constraint to cattle accumulation. We argue that without the presence of a cash crop (cotton), land use change would have been neither as extensive nor as rapid as has been observed. Therefore, conservation agencies should be as concerned by the way people farm as they are by population increase. Conserving biodiversity without jeopardising agricultural production will require the development of innovative technological and institutional options in association with policy and market interventions.

Compensatory mitigation, including creation of new wetlands, restoration of previously degraded wetlands, or preservation of existing wetlands, is one policy option that seeks to maintain no net loss of wetland habitat. Public support of wetland mitigation is essential because the public incurs the cost for many mitigation projects in the form of higher taxes. Therefore, public preferences should be considered when decisions are made about wetland mitigation options. We used a contingent-choice survey in Rhode Island to identify factors affecting public support for different types of compensatory wetland mitigation. Results were based on 640 survey responses. The amount of wetland lost during the original development project had no significant effect on the preferred mitigation alternative. Preferences for preservation, restoration, and no-action alternatives varied according to respondents' gender, education, and income. Certain general considerations applied, however, regardless of mitigation type. Respondents were willing to incur increases in taxes and fees for most mitigation projects. The larger the mitigation project and the lower the cost, the more likely it was to gain public support. The presence of endangered species contributed to public support, but less significantly than public access. Public access can be critical to public support, particularly if the size of the wetland is small or the cost is high. If the cost of providing public access, such as a boardwalk or viewing tower, is relatively small, the gain in public support for mitigation expenditures may well allow a substantial expansion of the area involved in mitigation projects and thus a greater increase in the amount of habitat conservation.","journal":"Conservation Biology","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

It has no transition zone and interactions with the surrounding human population are complex. A recently adopted management plan allows experiments with limited consumptive use of natural resources, in exchange for people's collaboration. In order to determine which resources are desired and which resources are liabilities, people in the Park's vicinity were interviewed. Respondents' attitudes towards conservation were positive, motivated by both use and intrinsic values, and with reference to future generations. Attitudes were significantly related to locally perceived benefits. Respondents found most of the Park's resources useful but differences between user groups were significant. User groups also differed in their complaints about human-wildliÂ£e conflicts, but overall they considered the animals most important for tourism as the main nuisance. This case study shows that local aspirations cannot all be met, but indicates that limited outreach can improve existing public support for conservation measures.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

A total of 53 farmland tree and one crop species from 22 families were documented. The most commonly found species were fruit and fodder species (on over 60 % farms) including banana (Musa paradisiaca), khasrato (Ficus hispida) and khanayo (Ficus semicordata). Tree density was highest (226/ha) on marginal farms (farm area â‰¤0.25 ha) and lowest (165/ha) on small farms (farm area 0.26-0.5 ha). For the study area as a whole, the Shannon-Wiener species diversity index was 3.26 and the species evenness index 1.89. Large farms (farm area >1 ha) had the greatest tree species diversity (4.47 Â± 0.52) and marginal farms the lowest (2.18 Â± 0.37), indicating the positive relationship between farm size and species diversity. A total of six types of cereals and 18 types of vegetable crops were grown in the study area. The major livestock component of each household was chickens (average 8/household) and goats (6/household). The mean value of livestock in the large farm category was estimated as $2235, significantly higher than that of the other three categories. A significant relationship was found between agrobiodiversity and livelihoods, irrespective of annual production, and the critical role of the farmed landscape in agrobiodiversity conservation was apparent.

Taking the strength of wellbeing aspirations as point of departure, we focus on two themes: the implications of MPA embeddedness in wider societal systems, and the consequences of natural and social variety for governance. We conclude first of all that conflict resolution depends on MPA authorities' willingness to engage with the interferences that emerge from outside the MPA area. Secondly, we point out the varying wellbeing aspirations of the population and the need to develop governance partnerships. The latter are argued to contribute to more balanced decision making, as well as to a greater appreciation among the target population of the 'fairness' of MPA policy.

These ecotones are critical for conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest-agriculture ecotones? (2) How can forest-agriculture ecotones contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture ecotones? We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, in the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE's interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest-agriculture ecotones. Simultaneously, ATREE's interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that play a critical role in the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive, strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture ecotones by the governmental agencies and international organizations. We argue that forest-agriculture ecotones offer a means to conserve biodiversity through alleviation of poverty and development of community-based institutions. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In stressed ecosystems, ecosystem functions may remain unchanged while changes in species composition-particularly dominance-and the health of individuals can change dramatically (Schindler et al. 1985). The species are more sensitive indicators of stress than the system. We suggest, therefore, that there is little value in trying to manage a marine ecosystem as a whole. Instead one should manage people's interaction with the particular ecosystem components that influence the quantity and quality of valued products. We call these particular interactions \"leverage points\" and use a 5-year study of the southeastern Australian continental shelf fishery ecosystem to show how leverage points can be found. Neither nearshore production nor predation on commercial fish species has a major influence on fisheries production; they therefore have little leverage potential. However, the interaction of benthic habitat with fish and fishers is a potential leverage point. Benthic habitat directly influences the fish community, and specific benthic habitats are vulnerable to fishing. Their vulnerability is increasing because of technological advances in accurate positioning (Global Positioning System) and position recording (trackplotters), fishing vessel power, and fishing gear. Accurate positioning can also be used to manage the location of fishing effort. For this leverage point to be successful, the spatial management nf fishing effort would need to be developed in collaboration with the fishing industry and to be targeted specifically at the vulnerable habitats. We suggest that new management instruments such as the transferable ecological stock rights are needed to link fisheries management directly to the ecosystem.","journal":"","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Therefore, there is a need to undertake restoration actions for both production and environmental services. To do so, there is a need to identify factors that are affecting the dynamics of parkland systems. The present study aimed at characterizing and quantifying tree diversity of parkland systems taking into consideration the household's wealth status, land uses, market access and the type of farming system (cereal based on the \"Plateau Central\" and cotton based in \"Boucle du Mouhoun\"). Six villages (KienfanguÃ©, IpelcÃ©, and Kuizili with easy access to the market and, Karang-Tanghin, Nionsna and Targho with poor access to the market) in the \"Plateau Central\" and six villages (Bondoukuy, Ouahabou and Yaho with easy access to the market and, Dora, FakÃ©na and Mamou with poor access to the market) in \"Boucle du Mouhoun\" were studied. In each village, the Participatory Analysis of Poverty and Livelihood Dynamics method was used by rural farmers to rank farmer households of their communities and that gave three groups of wealth status that are poor, fairly well-off and well-off. Five households representing each of the three wealth groups in each village, giving a total of 15 households per village, were randomly selected by wealth group. Tree/shrub inventories were conducted in all land use types (house fields, village fields and bush fields) of the 180 selected households for the 12 studied sites. The number of species in the different land use types ranged from 96 to 102, but the majority of species were represented by less than 10 individuals. This indicates the selection effect made by the farmers to the parklands. Land use and farming system showed a clear effect on tree diversity in parklands. The effect of accessibility to market was evident in some cases whereas wealth status did not show any effect. Despite the statistical significant effect of farming system and land use type, the ANOVA models accounted for relatively little variation, indicating that other factors may contribute to tree diversity in parkland systems. The most threatened species were Adansonia digitata, Afzelia africana, Bombax costatum,Celtis integrifolia,Ficus asperifolia, Ficus iteophylla, Lannea velutina, and Parkia biglobosa. These species were represented in the largest diameter class (â‰¥80 cm) or showed very few individuals in the different diameter classes. Due to the increasing degradation of the parklands, a domestication and conservation strategy of key threatened species needs to be developed and implemented with the participation of local communities.

These systems reflect the ecological knowledge of the farmers of such risk prone environments. Agroforestry parklands are playing an important role, through trees and shrubs providing soil cover that reduces erosion and buffers the impacts of climate change. They also provide green fodder that complements crop residues for livestock feeds, and fruits and leaves for human consumption and for income generation. The interactions between various components of the system influence the ecosystem service functions of trees of parklands (provisioning, regulating and supporting services) in several ways. These ecosystem functions have been at the center of the local ecological knowledge guiding the management options of the farmers and have also attracted the attention of scientists. Findings revealed new challenges that call for production options ensuring increased and diversified productivity of the systems while preserving the environment. Research on such challenges must adopt an inclusive approach based on local knowledge supported by science-based analyses of the socio-ecological systems in the face of high population pressure and climate change.

Structures to retard the process of soil loss have been adopted reluctantly and, even when adopted, the management and maintenance have been less than desirable. We evaluate the factors that influence the adoption and management of alley cropping in Haiti. Results of the adoption model show that institutional factors, such as membership in a local peasant organization and training in soil conservation practices, favorably influence adoption. Socio-economic factors such as gender, per capita income, and interaction between education and per capita income also significantly influence adoption of alley cropping in Gaita and Bannate. The management of alley cropping is influenced by demographic, socio-economic, institutional, and physical factors. The relative importance of each factor on the probability of adoption and management of alley cropping varies from one variable to another.

Using detailed field data for three time periods, 1970-72, 1986 and 2006-07, and drawing on earlier secondary data, a longitudinal analysis of changes in governance and livelihoods is undertaken. Increased exploitation of marine resources has widened the resource base and increased people's access to goods and services. Following the ban in 2005 on the bÃªche-de-mer trade, however, livelihoods have reverted to being more subsistence oriented. For almost two decades after 1978, a communal organization, the Area Council, succeeded in regulating exploitation of the atoll's marine resources to ensure sustainable use, but in the 1990s it collapsed. In addition there was a paralysis of institutions that had once settled land disputes. This failure of atoll governance is a greater threat to future 'sustainability' than the usual processes that are invoked for atolls and small islands generally. As the Solomon Islands state is also failing, we argue that local institutions and organizations have a vital role to play in managing access to resources and the future of livelihoods on Ontong Java atoll.

Usually the conflicts involve hyena predation on livestock and retaliatory killings by humans; however, direct attacks on humans by rabid or otherwise healthy hyenas do occur. These in turn compound the problems associated with reconciling protection of hyenas with the needs and safety of humans. This paper was motivated by a series of attacks which occurred in the town of Kombolcha in the Hararge Region of eastern Ethiopia. The attacks and the responses of the local people were an extension of a wider conflict across the region where children are occasionally attacked and hyenas killed. Yet hyenas persist in the region. I suggest here that an understanding of the mechanisms which permit hyenas to coexist with humans in the Hararge region extend beyond food availability and access to breeding sites for hyenas. There is an added dimension which stems from the remnants of a traditional belief system that the local people held prior to conversion to Islam. This entails that hyenas are conceived of as beneficial to the human population due to their propensity to kill and consume unseen spirits, and their capacity to act in accordance with human societal values. As long as the human population does not transgress any boundaries, the hyenas will not have cause to attack them. Meanwhile the hyenas need to restrict their activity times, rely entirely on anthropogenic foods, and refrain from preying on people and livestock. These kinds of detailed explorations of ethno-historical and socio-ecological aspects of human-animal relations can better inform efforts at mitigating human-wildlife conflict in Hararge region and beyond.

The area closed was named the 'Plaice Box' (PB) and beam trawl effort fell by over 90%,while the exemption fleets of small flatfish beam trawlers, gill netters targeting sole (Solea solea) and shrimp (Crangon crangon) trawlers increased their effort. Contrary to the expectation, plaice landings and biomass declined. The initial support for the PB from the fisheries was lost, whereas other stakeholder groups claimed that any failure was due to the fact that fishing had never been completely prohibited in the area. To evaluate whether the PB has been an effective management measure, the changes in the ecosystem (plaice, demersal fish, benthos) and fisheries are analyzed to test whether the observed changes are due to the PB or to changes in the environment unrelated to the PB. juvenile growth rate of plaice decreased and juveniles moved to deeper waters outside the PB. Demersal fish biomass decreased, whereas the abundance of epibenthic predators (Asterias rubens and Cancer pagurus) increased in the PB. Endobenthos, in particular the main food items of plaice (polychaetes and small bivalves) remained stable or decreased both inside and outside the PB. Currently catches of both plaice and sole from within the PB are lower than in the late 1980s and the exemption fleet often prefers to fish outside the Plaice Box alongside much larger competitors. It is concluded that the observed changes are most likely related to changes in the North Sea ecosystem, which may be related to changes in eutrophication and temperature. It is less likely that they are related to the change in fishing.

It is found that a decline in UK marine biodiversity could result in a varying, and at present unpredictable, change in the provision of goods and services, including reduced resilience and resistance to change, declining marine environmental health, reduced fisheries potential, and loss of recreational opportunities.

The social and environmental crisis can be addressed by engaging the rural poor with their considerable skills in resource management in the development effort. Efforts need to be coordinated both within and outside the immediate peasant situation. For example, the origins of the biased spatial organization of resource use, (the best lands are dominated by large farmers and more fragile lands are in the hands of small farmers) need to be addressed in any viable strategy of sustainable development. Obstacles need to be overcome at the field, farm, community, region, and national level in technological, institutional, political, and economic ways. This article focuses on the regional and institutional level and technology as instrumental to change at the local level. The structure of the discussion centered on the main ideas of \"sustainable thinking,\" the application of this thinking within a case study in Chimborazo conducted from 1988 to the present in the Ecuadoran Andes, and a description of how resource use has changed over time within the context of regional economic, social, and demographic change. There is an analysis of how peasants have struggled to sustain their social systems through changes in resource and labor use systems. Future efforts might be better coordinated based on the unsuccessful experiences exposed in the case study. The article further develops the ideas proposed by Gow on sustainable use of the land and the need for political commitment, institutional strengthening, improved local organization, environmental education, and economic development. Peasants constructed their own ideas about desirable livelihoods. This thinking led to the attacks on the hacienda as a way of coping with integration into the national economy. The peasant federations were not changing the basic structures underlying this incorporation. The local level could only do so much toward changing regional and national political strategies. These federations need support, because they are part of a weak and limited process of dealing with underdevelopment.","journal":"Development policy review : the journal of the Overseas Development Institute","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Therefore a strategy to foster pluralistic approaches to rural development should focus on building the capacities of those who have typically been marginalized by development strategies and discussions as well as on developing relationships that allow more effective, efficient and equal interactions and greater accountability among all participants. This article develops this argument by first drawing lessons from research into the nature of interinstitutional relationships among non-governmental organizations (NGOs), governments and rural peoples' organizations (PROs). It then links some of those findings to recent discussions of the role of networks, associations and relationships of trust (or what has been termed 'social capital') in sustainable development, and suggests that these discussions provide useful frameworks for thinking about pluralistic strategies. The article then considers two experiences in building institutional capacities and relationships: one is a longer-standing case from Bolivia; the other a more recent initiative in Colombia. In the Bolivian example, the initiative has comne from civil society, whereas in Colombia the initiative had come from government. The overall conclusion reached is that synergistic relatioships can indeed by built. While some of the examples come from agriculture, their institutional lessons are equally applicable to the case of forestry.","journal":"Unasylva","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Agriculture production goals appear to drive the traditional rangeland management focus on homogeneity and uniformity. To determine if preference for homogeneity is a broadly applicable social construct or one limited to agricultural producers, we determined preferences for heterogeneous grassland landscapes expressed by three study populations-managers of working lands (ranchers), natural resource professionals (grassland/rangeland specialists), and the general population living in rangeland regions within the US Great Plains. We distributed surveys that included photographs of landscapes and patterned images to assess preference. Preference for heterogeneous landscapes among ranchers, natural resource professionals, and the general population in our study area were generally consistent with the central paradigm of managing rangeland for homogeneity. However, we discovered that people, across geographic location and population group, clearly prefer heterogeneous patterned images to homogeneous patterned images. This suggests that preference for homogeneity is acquired.

Using surveys and field observations, this case study examines aspects of indigenous institutions and ecological knowledge used by rural Ecuadorians to manage a forest commons before and after interacting with two U.S.-based conservation NGOs: Earthwatch Institute and People Allied for Nature. The rural farming community of Loma Alta has legal property rights to a 6842-ha watershed in western Ecuador. This self-governing community curtailed destruction of their moist forest commons, but not without the influence of modern scientific ecological knowledge. When Earthwatch Institute scientists provided evidence that forest clearing would reduce water supply to the community, villagers quickly modified land allocation patterns and set rules of use in the forest establishing the first community-owned forest reserve in western Ecuador. This case demonstrates that synergy between traditional knowledge and western knowledge can result in sustaining both ecosystem services and biodiversity in a forest commons.

The tourist business and industry are no exception. The sector experiences the dual role of being the target of reform as well as the agent of change in co-operation with the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, which is establishing six different levels of conservation areas on communal and commercial (farm) land in an innovative Parks and Wildlife Management Act, integrating concepts such as protection, management and sustainable utilization of natural resources, cultural heritage as well as beauty and wilderness of (semi-)arid landscapes. This approach directs development into communal regions and state land, turning it into an instrument of spatial planning together with the introduction of community-based tourism in conservancies, hopefully empowering the rural poor, changing land-use patterns, questioning tenure systems or generating entrepreneurial skills. Benefits for all sections are monitored, but also tensions when (eco-)tourists' behaviour is perceived as socio-cultural intrusion or management becomes difficult. Concern arises whether this policy will sustain in a wider context of (inter)national development. Research predicting the growth in tourism for Namibia sends terrifying warning signals in anticipation of pressures likely imposed on the society and resources, requiring astronomical investments in the tourist industry.","journal":"Tourismus, landschaftsschutz und lokale entwicklung - Perspektiven des wandels in Namibia","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Where they have initially assumed an undifferentiated local community and a free flow of commonly understood information about environments and resources, they are potentially flawed. The devolution of natural-resource management authority to local communities raises questions about who participates in decision making and how state and local institutions work together. This article provides a historical perspective based on archival records that show how state forestry management in colonial Mali reflected the interests of the French administration, in contrast to those of the peasantry. The precolonial peasantry was internally differentiated, and change in the colonial political economy favored certain social groups. In the 1990s, Mali began to reform forestry policy so that forest resource user-groups could have a greater role in management. Data on income and expenditures from a periurban fuelwood-producing village show differential access to and dependence on forest resources for livelihood. Current natural-resource management reforms will do well to consider the role in local society of chiefs and representation of excluded groups.","journal":"Annals of the Association of American Geographers","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The focus of the article is on policies that, while increasing resilience at one scale, may cause increased vulnerability at other scales. Policies on forest protection and construction of hydroelectric dams contribute to regulating flooding of the lowland areas. However, the policies also result in severe constraints in access to land and forest products for the mountain population, which has impacts on their capacity to manage risk and adapt to environmental change. Forest resources have previously functioned as an important buffer for mountain households when coping with crises like serious floods. This reduced adaptive capacity may be a critical issue for equity and social sustainability in adaptation.

Three-fourths of Malawi's 13 million people rely on smallholder agriculture for their livelihoods. Increasing population, accelerating deforestation, poor soil and water management, and increasing poverty and land degradation directly impact the food security and human health of millions of Malawians. Cropping systems which combine cereal crops, agroforestry and small doses of inorganic fertilizers produce food-crop yields greater than inorganic fertilizers alone on degraded soils, as well as recuperating soil nutrients over a period of years. These agroforestry practices improve the livelihoods of farm families, lower risks associated with fertilizer price increases and drought and at the same time improve biodiversity and nutrient and water cycling in the agro-ecosystem. The World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) has a long history of agroforestry research and development in Malawi dating back to the 1980s. In 2007-2011, ICRAF implemented the Malawi Agroforestry Food Security Project (AFSP) through financial support from Irish Aid. ICRAF's task in AFSP was to build a strong partnership to reach 200,000 farming families in 11 districts. The purpose of AFSP was to combine tested agroforestry practices, effective partnership and informed policies to increase food security and income, and improve livelihood opportunities for rural communities in Malawi, through accelerated adoption of fertilizer trees, fruit trees, fodder trees and fuel-wood trees. To accomplish these purposes, ICRAF provided the farming communities with planting material (tree seeds and seedlings), and the knowledge of how to care for them and effectively combine them with food crops. The beneficiaries of the project saw increases in household food security and nutrition. However, difficulties were encountered in transporting tree seeds and seedlings across eleven districts in a timely fashion, and in managing the flow of reporting and disbursements of funding among such a large group of collaborators. Several solutions were implemented which improved performance in these areas, and which allowed the group to reach very near the targeted number of participants, and to plan for a second phase of the project.

However, small-scale community-based reserves are often inefficient owing to management inadequacies arising because of a lack of local support or enforcement or poor design. Because there are many potential pitfalls during the establishment of even small community-based reserves, it is important for coastal managers, communities, and facilitating institutions to have access to a summary of the key factors for success. Reviewing relevant literature, we present a framework of \"lessons learned\" during the establishment of protected areas, mainly in the Philippines. The framework contains summary guidance on the importance of (1) an island location, (2) small community population size, (3) minimal effect of land-based development, (4) application of a bottom-up approach, (5) an external facilitating institution, (6) acquisition of title, (7) use of a scientific information database, (8) stakeholder involvement, (9) the establishment of legislation, (10) community empowerment, (11) alternative livelihood schemes, (12) surveillance, (13) tangible management results, (14) continued involvement of external groups after reserve establishment, and (15) small-scale project expansion. These framework components guided the establishment of a community-based protected area at Danjugan Island, Negros Occidental, Philippines. This case study showed that the framework was a useful guide that led to establishing and implementing a community-based marine reserve. Evaluation of the reserve using standard criteria developed for the Philippines shows that the Danjugan Island protected area can be considered successful and sustainable. At Danjugan Island, all of the lessons synthesized in the framework were important and should be considered elsewhere, even for relatively small projects. As shown in previous projects in the Philippines, local involvement and stewardship of the protected area appeared particularly important for its successful implementation. The involvement of external organizations also seemed to have a key role in the success of the Danjugan Island project by guiding local decision-makers in the sociobiological principles of establishing protected areas. However, the relative importance of each component of the framework will vary between coastal management initiatives both within the Philippines and across the wider Asian region.

{"author":"Begossi, A.","year":2013,"title":"Ecological, cultural, and economic approaches to managing artisanal fisheries","dAbstract":"Approaches towards the management of artisanal fisheries have been enlightening the scientific literature for approximately the last 20Â years. Coming from diverse disciplines such as anthropology, biology, economy, and ecology (especially human ecology), these approaches have dealt with common theory, strategies for cooperation, decision-making models, cultural contexts, and local knowledge. Fishery management depends on an understanding of the interactions between humans and aquatic resources, and in case of indigenous or of native populations, forestry resources are also considered for livelihoods. Acquiring an understanding of the local knowledge about fish and other resources, of collective local arrangements and institutions, of market interactions, and of the decision-making processes of fishers is fundamental for the management of artisanal fisheries. This review includes historical and current approaches associated with the management of artisanal fisheries. These approaches include the following: (a) cultural and human ecological approaches, including ecological models such as optimal foraging theory; (b) institutional approaches, including processes of cooperation associated with local knowledge and institutions; and (c) current ecological-economic propositions towards fishery management, such as payments for environmental services. This revision is illustrated through examples, in particular, of data collected among coastal artisanal fisheries of the SE Atlantic Forest in Brazil.

To assess these outcomes, an indepth study was conducted in a fringe village in Kadapa district, where a JFM programme has been running since 1996. The study reveals that the community benefited immensely from the JFM programme in terms of employment in forest activities and income obtained from the collection of non-timber forest produce (NTFP), which helped the community to overcome the distress of poverty. Forest growth has been excellent due to strong community protection. On the institutional front, the study assessed the Strengths and weaknesses of the interactions between the community and the Forest Department (FD) through elaborate discussions with the members of a forest protection committee (FPC). The FD has failed to provide appropriate technical know-how to carry out forest management activities and legal support to resolve conflicts (customary rights problems) with neighbouring villages, and ignored traditional knowledge of the community in forest management. Despite this, the community's keen interest in the regeneration and protection of the forests can be attributed to the inherent attitudes they possess towards the forest.","journal":"Journal of Rural Development","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This paper investigates how common property institutional arrangements contribute to sustainable mangrove fisheries in coastal Ecuador, focusing on the fishery for the mangrove cockle (Anadara tuberculosa and A. similis), a bivalve mollusk harvested from the roots of mangrove trees and of particular social, economic, and cultural importance for the communities that depend on it. Specifically, this study examines the emergence of new civil society institutions within the historical context of extensive mangrove deforestation for the expansion of shrimp farming, policy changes in the late 1990s that recognized \"ancestral\" rights of local communities to mangrove resources, and how custodias, community-managed mangrove concessions, affect the cockle fishery. Findings from interviews with shell collectors and analysis of catchper-unit-effort (CPUE) indicate that mangrove concessions as common property regimes promote community empowerment, local autonomy over resources, mangrove conservation and recovery, higher cockle catch shares, and larger shell sizes, but the benefits are not evenly distributed. Associations without custodias and independent cockle collectors feel further marginalized by the loss of gathering grounds, potentially deflecting problems of overexploitation to \"openaccess\" areas, in which mangrove fisheries are weakly managed by the State. Using Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, the explicit link between social and ecological systems is studied at different levels, examining the relationship between collective action and the environment through quantitative approaches at the fishery level and qualitative analysis at the level of the mangrove landscape. Implications for coastal and fishery management are discussed in the conclusions.

This article traces the trajectory of coastal policy change and the transformation of mangrove tenure regimes from an implicit preference for shrimp aquaculture to a focus on conservation and sustainable development with greater community participation through the establishment of community-managed mangrove areas called custodias. I argue that while the custodias have empowered local communities in their struggle to defend their livelihoods and environment against the marginalizing forces of global shrimp aquaculture, the implementation of common property arrangements for mangrove fishery management has changed the nature of property rights, the distribution of resources, and social relations among collectors of mangrove cockles (Anadara tuberculosa and A. similis). I suggest a need to develop a political ecology of the commons, an analytical approach applied here to examine the fundamental shift in the nature of the struggle over mangrove resources, from artisanal fishers versus shrimp farmers to a struggle between compaÃ±eros: members of associations versus independent cockle collectors. Such a shift in the struggle over resources threatens to undermine the sustainability of the fishery. I conclude that shifting access may be an important underlying factor contributing to a tragedy of enclosures in Ecuador's mangrove cockle fishery.","journal":"Journal of Political Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This study revealed that arable weed communities have long-lived seeds compared to the transient seed bank of deciduous woodland; species-rich grassland communities tend to have a short-lived soil seed bank, intermediate between the latter two communities, Moreover, the present study showed that significant differences in community longevity exist between weed communities as well as between grassland communities. The approach based on soil seed bank spectra of plant communities gives support to existing phytosociological theories on different strategies of plant communities sensu Stortelder (1992) and Schaminee & Stortelder (1996). The information on seed longevity of communities is essential to the practice of nature conservation and nature development because it reveals the possible vulnerability of plant communities to extinction, including their soil seed banks, the necessity of their conservation and their possibilities for regeneration.","journal":"Acta Botanica Neerlandica","included":false,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":true}

An important set of factors in farmers' use of improved agricultural technologies is generally known to be their possession of livelihood assets. This study examines the influence of ownership of livelihood assets in farmers' decisions to use cattle manure as land improvement technology, which is currently being promoted by Ethiopia's agricultural extension system. The study was conducted in Dangila woreda (district) in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. Data were collected from a survey of 201 rural households from April to June 2011 and in October 2012. Logistic regression modelling and Chi-square and t-tests were used to analyse data. The findings show that plot distance from residence, number of livestock owned, use of dung for fuel, maize-vegetable-fruit intercropping, land to man ratio and perception of land tenure security were important determinants of manure use among the farmers. Existing and future local development interventions should focus on these factors to improve the farmers' capability to invest in cattle manure application and sustainable land management.

It is utilized for nutrition of people and livestock, as well as in medicine and in cosmetics. It protects against desertification and erosion while producing wood for various end-uses. The natural stands, in constant reduction since the 19th century, are more and more threatened by anthropomorphic pressures, hampering the natural regeneration of the species. Given this situation, Cirad was asked in 2006 to take part in a practical project, that was to be financially supported for 3 years, with a view to restoring argan tree natural stands. The goal of this project is to improve, through applied research approaches, the quality of the current argan tree stands. Taking advantage of the variation within the species, superior mother trees (plus trees) will be selected. These latter will be mass propagated using the most suitable cloning techniques to produce ultimately better adapted and more homogeneous clonal populations. After 2 years of close collaboration with the Centre Regional de Recherches Forestieres de Marrakech and the Universite de Marrakech, on testing different rooting conditions, one thousand rooted cuttings have been produced from juvenile argan tree seedlings. This material will be used as experimental stock plants and for field tests, in comparison with traditional seedlings. In addition, out of the 14 plus trees selected by the local people to be mass clonally produced, 8 have already been successfully mobilized in an ex situ clone bank for initiating their mass clonal propagation by rooted cuttings, prior to field testing and identification of superior clones for plantation establishment. The vegetative propagation techniques developed can also be used for large scale production of rooted cuttings from the seedlings derived from the fruits collected from the plus-trees, presumably of superior quality.","journal":"Bois Et Forets Des Tropiques","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The development of recreational services and ecological and cultural education programs could create solid foundations for the sustainable development of protected areas and their surroundings. At the same time, tourism could improve the economical situation of livelihoods and increase the motivation of local people towards conservation. The Ecocentre \"Zapovednigs\" with a partnership of the Europark Federation identified the existing gaps and initiated a joint project \"Catalyzing civil activities and local socioeconomic initiatives using the potential of protected areas and PS-based NGOs\" to find a new model for regional development in live with the nature conservation objectives in the Mary El and in the Buryatia Repulic, Russia. During the project, training courses about the sustainable development of the tourism and environmentally sound service production were organized, coordination committees comprising of relevant stakeholders were established, guest houses were built and package tours were developed. The money spent by tourists was further invested to improve tourist services in the region and conservation of natural and cultural heritage. During the project, visible positive effects were achieved, both in economic terms and in changed attitudes of local communities and politicians towards the protected areas. According to results of the project, the success of the implementation of sustainable livelihoods and tourism development programmes seem to depend only partly on the level of economical investments. It is also important to create efficient co-operation networks of the relevant stakeholders and achieving their support and involvement in these programmes.

In the remote case study village of Moa in Central Sulawesi, we found that while few households cultivated cacao in the early 1990s, all had planted cacao by 2000. Furthermore, the vast majority cultivate cacao in former food-crop focused swidden fields under full-sun conditions. Farmers cultivate cacao to establish property rights in light of a land shortage driven in part by the prohibition of farming and forest product collecting in a nearby national park, and to secure a future source of income, a concern that has been exacerbated by Indonesia's economic crisis. However, conversion of swidden fields to sun-grown cacao constrains future food production opportunities, increases susceptibility to drought stress and potential soil nutrient and organic matter losses, and increases household dependence on a commodity that is subject to extreme price volatility. These factors raise significant concerns for local food security and agricultural sustainability.

The zootherapeutic knowledge inherited since time immemorial was mostly based on the use of domestic animals and wild animals as important medicinal resources. It is suggested that this kind of knowledge may be useful to save the life in emergency. The study also gives emphasis on the strategies of conservation and management of faunistic resources. The ethnozoological practice indicates that traditional knowledge of zootherapy is a must and to be strengthened in order to discover the new line of resources in pharmaceutics.","journal":"Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

However, it is yet to lead to better environmental or development outcomes for fisheries stakeholders in terms of food security, improved livelihoods and ecological sustainability. This paper takes an empirical approach by focusing on the fundamentals of resilience thinking to evaluate its usefulness in developing relevant management interventions in small-scale fisheries in the Niger River Basin in West Africa. The paper presents the outputs of a participatory assessment exercise where both fishery communities and local experts were involved at two different scales. The resilience frame used was designed to facilitate the identification of socially defined thresholds that help delineate the desirability of the current system configuration and provides a diagnosis framework that tailors management solutions to problems in local context. The analysis highlights some key contributions from resilience thinking to the challenge of diagnosis in small-scale fisheries management in developing countries, as well as important contributions that emerge from taking a pragmatic and critical approach to its application.

The research employed six in-depth interviews and 124 household surveys to assess how the community forest is utilized and identify how gender is mainstreamed in forest management. The results shows that community forest utilization offers opportunities for forest sustainability. However, findings on gender involvement reveal that the women are continuously dominated, with only three women out of 20 representatives on the village forest committee and making decisions (women make up only 16% of the village forest committees). Women are also not well represented in forest conservation initiatives despite the fact that they are the source of food security for their households. This paper argues that the lack of knowledge exchange and women's continued exclusion from forest management are critical issues that could undermine the future of the world's forests. This research recommends a more participatory approach that will provide for women's equal participation in decision making and their full contribution in forest resource conservation.

Despite the policy shift in the conservation literature from 'fortress' to community-based conservation, we argue that in practice conservation still tends to dominate when there is a trade-off between Western-style conservation and support to the livelihoods of marginalized communities. This can again be explained by the hegemony of a conservation discourse that is shared by a network of actors. The article highlights the role played by powerful environmental organizations and wealthy individuals supporting conservation at the expense of land redistribution in Namaqualand. The combination of scientific research and finances provided by this actor-network aided the creation and expansion of the Park. Local people, however, see the expansion of the Park as direct and unfair competition for land that they wish to acquire through the land redistribution programme, as well as an indirect challenge to their local livelihoods. Whatever the merits of their case, it seems clear that communities aspiring to more land, together with advocates of human rights and poverty alleviation, remain on the margins in terms of policy influence, especially when they pursue goals that are perceived by the conservation advocates to be in conflict with those of biodiversity conservation.","journal":"Africa","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are effective conservation and fisheries management tools that can also have a broad array of positive and negative social, economic, cultural, and political impacts on local communities. Drawing on results from a mixed-methods study of communities on the Andaman Coast of Thailand, this paper explores perceptions of MPA impacts on community livelihood resources (assets) and outcomes as well as MPA governance and management. The area includes 17 National Marine Parks (NMPs) that are situated near rural communities that are highly dependent on coastal resources. Interview participants perceived NMPs to have limited to negative impacts on fisheries and agricultural livelihoods and negligible benefits for tourism livelihoods. Perceived impacts on livelihoods were felt to result from NMPs undermining access to or lacking support for development of cultural, social, political, financial, natural, human, physical, and political capital assets. Conflicting views emerged on whether NMPs resulted in negative or positive marine or terrestrial conservation outcomes. Perceptions of NMP governance and management processes were generally negative. These results point to some necessary policy improvements and actions to ameliorate: the relationship between the NMP and communities, NMP management and governance processes, and socio-economic and conservation outcomes.

A keystone contribution to the ecosystem service literature has been the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, MA, (Ecosystems and human well-being: a framework for assessment, Island Press, Washington, DC; 2003, 2005). Much of the work on ecosystem services to date has focused on the assessment and classification of environmental functions. The need for inclusion of community perspectives in ecosystem assessments has been widely recognized in order to better understand the distribution of impacts and benefits resulting from natural resource use. Communities can offer a direct route to understanding the complex relationships between ecosystems and human well-being and how environmental management affects their livelihoods. Photovoice has been made popular as a tool for participatory needs assessment but it has had limited use in ecosystem assessments to date. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to present the results of a community-level assessment of environmental services in a watershed dominated by pineapple monoculture in Costa Rica; and (2) to evaluate the strengths and the limitations of photovoice as a tool for mapping the relationship between ecosystems and people. I argue that photovoice is an underutilized methodology that has the potential to complement biophysical ecosystem service assessments in the context of impoverished and resource-dependent communities, particularly, since assessing ecosystem services and acting upon that information requires integrating the knowledges of diverse stakeholders, recognizing power imbalances, and grappling with the complexity of social-ecological systems. Processes such as photovoice have the potential to catalyze community self-organization, which is a critical component for empowerment.","journal":"Environmental Management","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

In CÃ¢n Tho', rice-fish farmers had significantly higher income (43.6 million dong ha -1 year -1) than other farmer groups, while this was not seen among rice-fish famers in TiÃªn Giang (32.4 million dong ha -1 year -1), which partly could be due to a high use of insecticides (0.9 kg active ingredient ha -1 crop -1) and comparatively low fish yield among these farmers. The study emphasizes the need to rethink current agricultural systems and to provide opportunities for more diverse systems that maintain and enhance a range of ecosystem services and protect human health. Future production systems should not be optimized to only provide a single ecosystem service, such as rice, but designed to deliver a variety of interlinked ecosystem service such as rice, fish, pest control, and nutrient recycling.

This is a fundamental issue in conservation but one that is often neglected, leading to poor conservation outcomes. It is thus imperative that we come to understand better the complex relationships between humans and nature. To do so, we need to examine nature and the often assumed dichotomy between humans and nature. We conducted a qualitative social research inquiry to explore the societal relationships with nature in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve in Chile. From the results, we developed a framework that illustrates how different natures are created in the three-way relationship among the individual, society, and the physical world. We further discuss the implications of the co-existence of various natures in one place. Their explicit consideration bears important potential for improving conservation practice.

Retrospective studies provide insight into the scale, nature, and timing of human influence on reef ecosystems. Using Papua New Guinea as a model, we assessed human influences on the historical status of reef resources through time. Reef resources were divided into seven ecological guilds, assessed over seven cultural periods and in reference to seven types of human influences. Ranking of ecological status and human influence was performed based on extensive bibliographical research. Evidence for periods of sustainability and depletion were found throughout historical and modern periods. More recently, acceleration in the rate of resource depletion has occurred as a result of increasing pressure at unprecedented scales. Subsistence lifestyles are becoming unviable or unattractive since the introduction of the cash economy during colonial times. Current challenges such as providing livelihood options and sustaining replenishment rates of reef resources have arisen from a long history of overexploitation that preconditioned the current status of reef resources under an economic climate of increasing demand for these resources. Studies of past human exploitation of reef resources can help to overcome the shifting baseline syndrome for fisheries management in marine ecosystems and help characterize the scale and intensity of human drivers influencing resource exploitation.

This financial incentives-based climate change mitigation strategy proposed by the UNEP, World Bank, GEF and environmental NGOs seeks to integrate forests into carbon sequestration schemes. Its proponents view REDD+ as part of an adaptive strategy to counter the effects of global climate change. This paper combines the theoretical approaches of market environmentalism and environmental narratives to examine the politics of environmental knowledge that are redefining socio-nature relations in the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania to make mangrove forests amenable to markets. Through a case study of a \"REDD-readiness\" climate change mitigation and adaptation project, we demonstrate how a shift in resource control and management from local to global actors builds upon narratives of environmental change (forest loss) that have little factual basis in environmental histories. We argue that the proponents of REDD+ (Tanzanian state, aid donors, environmental NGOs) underestimate the agency of forest-reliant communities who have played a major role in the making of the delta landscape and who will certainly resist the injustices they are facing as a result of this shift from community-based resource management to fortress conservation.

Ecologists trying to value ecosystems have proposed five categories of these services: preserving, supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural. While this ecosystem services framework attributes 'material' value to nature, sacred natural sites are areas of 'non-material' spiritual significance to people. Can we reconcile the material and non-material values? Ancient classical traditions recognise five elements of nature: earth, water, air, fire and ether. This commentary demonstrates that the perceived properties of these elements correspond with the ecosystem services framework. Whilst the two can be reconciled, the 'elements of nature' framework is argued to be more suitable to make a case for conservation of sacred natural sites because it can be attractive to traditional societies whilst being acceptable to Western science.

These forest fragments are an example of community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400 years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches? How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace's (1956) framework of 'cultural revitalization' and based on historical literature and palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India. It suggests various social, ecological and economic drivers of such revitalization, recognizing strong linkages between the 'social' and the 'ecological' within the social-ecological system of sacred forest groves. This example of reforestation suggests that contemporary restoration of forests needs to operate at a landscape scale and look at restoration as a social-ecological intervention in forest management.

Hailstorms pose a threat to people as well as property in Sydney, Australia. Emergency planning demands current, large-scale spatio-temporal information on urban areas that may be susceptible to hailstones. Several regions, dominated by less resistant roofing materials, have a higher vulnerability to hailstorm damage than others. Post-disaster operations must focus on allocating dynamic resources to these areas. Remote sensing data, particularly airborne hyperspectral sensor data, consist of spectral bands with narrow bandwidths, and have the potential to quantify and distinguish between urban features such as roofing materials and other man-made features. A spectral library of surface materials from urban areas was created by using a full range spectroradiometer. The image was atmospherically corrected using the empirical line method. A spectral angle mapper (SAM) method, which is an automated method for comparing image spectra to laboratory spectra, was used to develop a classification map that shows the distribution of roofing materials with different resistances to hailstones. Surface truthing yielded high percentage accuracy. Spatial overlay technique was performed in a GIS environment where several types of cartographic data such as special hazard locations, population density, data about less mobile people and the street network were overlaid on the classified geo-referenced hyperspectral image. The integrated database product, which merges high quality spectral information and cartographic GIS data, has vast potential to assist emergency organizations, city planners and decision makers in formulating plans and strategies for resource management.

Both remote sensing and communication technologies can be used to achieve this goal. With its primary emphasis on application of space technology, on an end-to-end basis, towards national development, the Indian Space Program has distinguished itself as one of the most cost-effective and development oriented space programs in the world. Developing nations are faced with the enormous task of carrying development oriented education to the masses at the lower strata of their societies. One important feature of these populations is their large number and the spread over vast and remote areas of these nations, making the reaching out to them a difficult task. Satellite communication (Satcom) technology offers the unique capability of simultaneously reaching out to very large numbers, spread over vast areas, including the remote corners of the country. It is a strong tool to support development education. India has been amongst the first few nations to explore and put to use the Satcom technology for Education and Development oriented services to the rural masses. Most of the developing countries have inadequate infrastructure to provide proper medical care to the rural population. Availability of specialist doctors in rural areas is a major bottleneck. Use of Satcom and information technology to connect rural clinics to urban hospitals through telemedicine systems is one of the solutions; and India has embarked upon an effective satellite based telemedicine programme. Space technology is also useful in disaster warning and management related applications. Use of satellite systems and beacons for locating the distressed units on land, sea or air is well known to us. ISRO is already a part of the International initiative called Satellite Aided Seacrch and Rescue System. The programme to set up satellite based Village Resource Centres (VRCs) across India, for providing a variety of services relevant to the rural communities, is also a unique societal application of space technology. The VRCs are envisaged as single window delivery mechanism for a variety of space based products and services, such as tele-education; telemedicine; information on natural resources for planning and development at local level; interactive advisories on agriculture, fisheries, land and water resources management, livestock management, etc; interactive vocational training towards alternative livelihood; e-governance; weather information; etc. This paper describes the various possibilities and potentials of Satcom and Remote Sensing technologies for societal applications.

Transfrontier parks may be viable alternatives in achieving development that is sustainable by protecting southern Africa's fragile environments, generating more funds and bringing significant and major improvements to the lives of the rural poor. At the same time, transfrontier parks raise issues of sovereignty of national governments, create complexity in governance processes and can lead to the needs of rural communities being sacrificed.

It is locally believed that Changthang's rangelands are overstocked with kiang, resulting in forage competition with livestock. Here, we provide a review and preliminary data on the causes of this conflict. Erosion of people's tolerance of the kiang can be attributed to factors such as the loss of traditional pastures during an Indo-Chinese war fought in 1962, immigration of refugees from Tibet, doubling of the livestock population in about 20 years, and increasing commercialization of cashmere (pashmina) production. The perception of kiang overstocking appears misplaced, because our range-wide density estimate of 0.24 kiang km-2 (Â± 0.44, 95% CL) is comparable to kiang densities reported from Tibet. A catastrophic decline during the war and subsequent recovery of the kiang population apparently led to the overstocking perception in Ladakh. In the Hanle Valley, an important area for the kiang, its density was higher (0.56 km-2) although even here, we estimated the total forage consumed by kiang to be only 3-4% compared to 96-97% consumed by the large livestock population (78 km-2). Our analysis nevertheless suggests that at a localized scale, some herders do face serious forage competition from kiang in key areas such as moist sedge meadows, and thus management strategies also need to be devised at this scale. In-depth socioeconomic surveys are needed to understand the full extent of the conflicts, and herder-centered participatory resolution needs to be facilitated to ensure that a sustainable solution for livelihoods and kiang conservation is achieved.

We found human depredation levels by leopards have increased by 65% from 2001 to 2008. Tea estates adjoining the forested areas were identified as conflict hotspots. We found a significant increase in human depredation levels in the tea estates adjoining Gorumara National Park (GNP) from 2005 to 2007, following the release of a large number of rescued leopards into GNP during 2005-06. This may indicate that translocation of \"problem\" leopards into forests have increased conflict in adjoining areas. Monitoring captured leopards after relocation can confirm this. Most locals felt fear and hatred toward leopards. The local communities need to be involved while framing management guidelines.

The present study attempts to analyse the government policies, programmes and legal provisions regarding JFM with emphasis on empowerment in the Madhya Pradesh context. One of the major thrusts of the empowerment is capacity development. The efforts made by the Forest Department in capacity development are not yet able to yield the desired results in the field. However, there has been a basic shift towards empowerment and a large number of people, at least feel, that they are politically, socially and personally empowered after being involved in JFM. The translation of the empowerment into actual practice is going to be a major challenge for the sustainability of the JFM in the future.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

In the study area, due to the extremely dry climate and the erratic nature of rainfall, only about 20% of people undertake rainfed agriculture with the result that forests are under tremendous pressure from cattle grazing and Fire. Unsustainable harvesting and collection of NTFPs has reduced their availability in the natural forest, which is threatening the livelihood of the tribal collectors. This paper is an outcome of three years of action research implemented with the local community at Sheopur District of Madhya Pradesh. Community awareness generation, science and technology application for NTFP processing and value addition and capacity building were the key approaches for rural livelihood and income generation. The case study emphasises the activities required for sustainable NTFP management.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Bhattacharya, P.; Pradhan, L.; Yadav, G.","year":2010,"title":"Joint forest management in India: Experiences of two decades","dAbstract":"Joint Forest Management (JFM), embracing the philosophy of forest conservation and livelihood improvement through cooperation between state and civil society, has emerged over the past decades both as a specific paradigm of forest governance in India and as India's largest community forestry program. The JFM program, evolved during early 1970s covering a few forest villages as a model for reversing the trend of degraded forest ecosystem through the active protection by local villagers. The JFM program is implemented currently by 106,482 Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMC) and it covers 22 million ha of forests spread across 28 constituent states of India and union territories. JFM emerged against a backdrop of two centuries of centralised bureaucratic control over forest management in India. Centralized control during the 19th and 20th centuries failed either to conserve resources or to contribute substantially to the well-being of local populations. However, inconsistent persuasions from decentralization policies in India under present forest policy (1988) have prompted people to analyse the theoretical basis for accepting that decentralization would bring improvements in forest ecosystem management. Still others have contested the de facto rationale for decentralization (i.e., improved forest management) and have suggested that decentralization may be a manipulation by elites to serve their own interests or to shift power, for example from national to international agencies that have funded decentralization. Thirty years from its inception, there are now concerns for the recent effectiveness of JFM (over the past 20 years) because it is a group action that is getting old and is perhaps losing some of its pioneering drive and innovativeness. Although JFM has been administered nationally, decisions on implementation detail have been left to the individual states, resulting in different strategies. The long history of JFM has also provided scope for experiences with it to change over time as well as between places. Given the range of experiences with and perceptions of JFM, as well as the importance of the objectives JFM ostensibly serves, the time is ripe therefore for a retrospective evaluation to take stock of its actual achievements, its status and ways forward. The current paper seeks to provide such a review and analysis. The paper highlights design and implementation issues related to government resolutions, benefits-sharing and forest offences. It also assesses the critical design factors and key drivers responsible for institutional reforms. The paper evaluates impacts of protection on forest productivity and on the livelihoods of local communities. It highlights that the JFM program, by virtue of the diversity of its implementation, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring why similar reforms can lead to different outcomes. The paper argued that though there are supporting government policy and guideline and massive fund support, why there has been a low down of enthusiasm for JFM in the last two decades. From experiences, it suggests strategies for its revival and JFM can further contribute effective toward forest conservation and enhanced livelihood opportunities in the future.

Certain factors have been identified in the literature to optimize both preservation and economic contribution, while the strategies to accomplish these factors have not been defined. In this paper, five success factors in ecotourism development (i. e. an integrated approach, planning and developing in proper sequence, education and training, maximizing local benefits, and evaluation and feedback) were analyzed and identified with the strategies described under each factor. The results indicated that success factors should be reevaluated and identified using an ecosystem management approach which puts the health of the environment as the foundation of tourism development.

For socio-economic status, Participatory Human Resource Interaction Appraisal method was used and for biodiversity assessment, direct census method and point count were used. Floral biodiversity contained 79 species of plants including; trees (n=48 species); herbs (n=8 species); shrubs (n=9 species); grasses (n=7 species); reeds (n=5 species) and weeds (n=2 species).Fauna included fish (n=21 species), amphibians (n=3 species), reptiles (n=9 species), mammals (n=14 species) and birds (n=171) species. The high illiteracy rate (64 percent) in the surroundings of TBWS was estimated. Overall the local community was dependent on wetland products for use of fuel wood (77 percent), livestock grazing (100 percent), fishing (90 percent), hunting, freshwater turtles trading (10 percent) and others (9 percent). Villagers who live in mud-built houses constitute 42 percent, concrete houses 30 percent and thatched houses 28 percent. Typical means of transportation in the area was still animal driven cart (25 percent). In Bait Qaimwala 75 percent households were ultra poor. In Basti Allahwali 15 percent households were poor, 35 percent extremely poor and 5 percent ultra poor. In Jannu village, 55 percent households were poor and 45 percent were non poor. There is need to reorganize the social sector and help local communities to fully benefit from the potential of ecotourism. In conclusion, community participation for sustainable use of natural resources in wildlife sanctuary will give a new strength to biodiversity conservation in study area.","journal":"Journal of Animal and Plant Sciences","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Due to the habitat degradation of the wildlife, the natural prey of carnivore species is declined resulting into the increased depredation of livestock, which in turn causes the human-carnivore conflicts. This paper presents the results of the study of the human-carnivore relationship in Tehsil Dhirkot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan during 2009-2010. Study was aimed to explore the extent of depredation (injuries and deaths) of livestock and human beings by different carnivore species, estimation of the economic loss of the local villagers, perceptions of the locals and retaliatory killings of carnivores during the last three years. A sum total of 150 affectees were interviewed using structured questionnaires and discussions were made with the local community during 40 surveys conducted in 20 villages of eight union councils of the study area. Three main carnivore species were found to be responsible for livestock killing and human injury. Common Leopard was responsible for the majority (70.8%) of such livestock killing; mainly goats (20%) and donkeys (18%). Jackals were responsible for about 80% of the poultry killings. These livestock depredations by carnivore species lead to a financial loss of about US$ 23529.41 to the local community during 2009-2010. Four persons were also injured during the leopard attacks at Surang, Hill, Munhasa and Sohawa. In response, four leopards were killed by the local community at Ghaziabad, Narakot, Surang and Rangla. Most (85%) of the people dislike predators and about 90% respondents recommended that predators should be conserved in zoos and wildlife parks while 10% respondents were in favor of predator conservation in natural habitat. The study revealed that leopards along with other carnivore species were widely involved in depredation of livestock and has been heavily persecuted by the rural communities. This issue is the major threat to the conservation of large carnivore species. To improve both large carnivore population and local livelihood prospects around study area, conservation and management projects with conflict mitigation strategies should be initiated.","journal":"Journal of Animal and Plant Sciences","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Bieling, C.; Schraml, U.","year":2004,"title":"What is closer to nature than the forest? about private owners' perception of their forests","dAbstract":"Ecologically sound forest management is deemed the guiding model of forest politics in the last decade. As the concept is to be universally applied, also forests owned by non-industrial private persons gain attention, especially because experts in administration and science assess in particular the smaller private forests as being in relatively bad conditions. This leads to the question if this characterization of the situation meets with the perceptions of the private owners themselves. Based on a socio-psychological model, this paper develops hypotheses regarding the perceptions and assessments of non-industrial private forest owners. The analysis of two surveys among app. 1500 non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, is used to review these assumptions. Of main importance are the perceptions of forest owners regarding the condition of their forests (Fig. 1 and 2), their forest management (Tab. 6), the state of the own forest (Tab. 5 and 7), their preferences (Tab. 2, 3 and 4) and the assessment of own possibilities to influence forest condition parameters (Tab. 8). It becomes evident that NIPF owners extensively internalize the discourse of ecologically sound management and close-to-nature forestry. Their preferences are not only coined by these influences of society but also by the context of the surrounding landscape and structural factors such as their professional orientation. The condition of the own forest is described as close-to-nature which is in contrast to the view of experts in administration and research. It can be concluded that the extensive windthrows in the 1990s introduced a change in awareness of the forest owners.","journal":"Was ist der natur nÃ¤her als der wald?

In many lower and middle-income countries, including South Africa, avitourism is being applied in an effort to simultaneously achieve community development and biodiversity conservation. This paper presents the results of an exploratory investigation of 11 community-based avitourism projects in South Africa. Conservation benefits were measured with the Threat Reduction Assessment tool. We calculated the Gamma (G) correlation coefficient to explore the relationship between conservation and income benefits and project characteristics. The projects were successful at reducing threats to sites where conservation was an explicit objective (n=11, G=0.609, P=0.03). The level of income benefits did not correlate with success in reducing threats to conservation. Once involved in avitourism projects, the average monthly income earned by local bird guides increased from USD 114 to USD 362. The extent of income benefits was positively related to the extent of support to projects (n=10, G=0.714, P=0.01). Participants in the projects reported substantive capacity building and empowerment benefits. Success in delivering conservation, income and empowerment benefits was challenged by the local guide's limited previous exposure to tourism and business, the guide's lack of self assurance, cultural differences, and a requirement for sustained mentorship and support to overcome these barriers. We conclude that with adequate long-term support, avitourism projects can be a cost-effective way to create jobs and deliver conservation and human development benefits.

In 1989, the Ugandan government formerly recognised that wetlands need to be conserved and contribute considerably to the National economy and rural livelihood. The present analysis is focused on the Nabugabo wetland ecosystem. Located in Central Uganda, it is an important part of the extensive system of wetlands that surround Lake Victoria. The Nabugabo wetland is a source of important resources that are basic to the local economy, including fishing, water utilization, agriculture, livestock, wetland plants for construction and more recently, tourism. Investment in the area is low and a large percentage of the local community depends on the wetland resources for basic sustenance needs. After achieving Ramsar status, demarcation and conservation activities were initiated by the local and national leaders. However, these conservation efforts have provoked conflicts between the land owners and the policy makers, in particular to the demarcation of areas for conservation In the present analysis, we examine the benefits, perceived by local leaders and community members, of the wetland and its services, as well as views towards its conservation and management. The results show that differences between the community leaders and member exist regarding the perceived benefits of the wetlands. Tourism, while providing some opportunities for local persons is not always viewed positively. Conservation activities are viewed positively but some questions remain as to whether such efforts help or hinder the local population, in particular regarding access to basic resources.

{"author":"BillÃ©, R.; Lapeyre, R.; Pirard, R.","year":2012,"title":"Biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation: A way out of the deadlock?","dAbstract":"The rural poor often depend on biodiversity for a wide range of natural resources and ecosystem services essential for their well-being, and are therefore potentially affected by its degradation. Against this backdrop, conservationists, development practitioners and policy makers often have differing opinions on how-and whether-to link biodiversity conservation with poverty reduction. Nonetheless, the growing volume of literature on the subject often results in platitudes that fail to confront real problems faced by development projects, plans and policies. Indeed, the linkages between biodiversity and poverty are much more complex and dynamic that often assumed; this is why endeavours to address the real issues-rather than pretending they do not exist-as well as efforts to be more specific about definitions, contexts and activities when undertaking assessments, are so badly needed. As a result, this paper first synthesises the biodiversity-poverty debate in a static perspective by investigating scientific evidence on the links between biodiversity per se, ecosystems and wellbeing; it further questions whether poor households particularly rely on biodiversity for their livelihoods. In dynamic terms, it thereafter explores whether biodiversity conservation is a route to poverty alleviation, and conversely if poverty alleviation is a route to better biodiversity management. We continue by presenting two emerging (or re-emerging) issues which challenge some key preconceived ideas about the poverty-biodiversity nexus: the \"environmentalist paradox\" and the need to re-open the Millennium consensus so as to give more weight to inequalities reduction as opposed to poverty alleviation.

The project was divided into two phases: an experimental/investigational phase and an extension phase. In the experimental phase, pilot-scale culture experiments were conducted to evaluate the possibility and feasibility of the cultivation of the red alga, Kappaphycus alvarezii, in the southwest coast of Kerala. Pilot-scale studies of seaweed culture were conducted in the shallow subtidal waters on the Vizhinjam Harbor area in two bamboo rafts tied with seeds of K. alvarezii (100Â±1.20 g) following accepted culture and growth monitoring procedures. The first harvest was carried out after 45 days and the growth was nearly eight times the initial biomass (826Â±2.80 g). A group of local fishermen were trained in the fabrication of culture rafts, implanting seed material, rearing the seedlings with periodical monitoring, harvesting, and post-harvest technologies like drying, sorting, packing, etc. as part of the pilot-scale study. The pilot-scale efforts showed good scope for the further expansion of the large-scale cultivation of K. alvarezii in the southwest coast of Kerala by imparting training and adopting fishermen families for their additional employment/alternative livelihood. Success in the pilot-scale cultivation led to the second phase of the project, the extension phase, which fulfilled the main objectives of the DST WOS-B programme. Vizhinjam Gramapanchayat (village), where the pilot-scale cultivation was carried out successfully and headed by a woman president, came forward to pool resources of the project to be implemented as a Model Seaweed Cultivation Programme. A training/workshop on \"seaweed farming technology\" was conducted and nearly 60 people were trained. Mangalam purusha sahaya sangham, a registered self-help group (SHG) of Vizhinjam, came forward to start the culture operations at Vizhinjam with technical backup from the DST-WOS-B Programme. Some seaweed entrepreneurs from inside and outside Kerala also came forward with a 100% buyback guarantee for the produce.

As in many Himalayan regions, livelihood sustainability is linked to forest resources, products and services. Recent development in the region, to which these systems may be vulnerable, brings into question environmental and livelihood sustainability. This paper examines the resilience of integrated systems of people and nature, or social-ecological systems, in the face of development pressures by evaluating a number of local and state-level institutional responses. Resilience, which describes the ability of the social-ecological systems to adapt to change by buffering shocks, improving self-organization and increasing capacity for learning, is an essential quality for sustainable development. Institutional responses which positively contribute to resilience and sustainability include the work of mahila mandais in forest management, adoption of Joint Forest Management (JFM) policies and practices, upholding rules, strengthening local institutions, establishing firewood depots and adopting alternative energy sources. Institutional failures brought about by the lack of rule enforcement and corruption erode resilience. The analysis of institutional responses helps to identify areas where capacity exists and areas in which capacity building is needed to produce resilient socialecological systems and therefore, sustainable development.","journal":"International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Through empirical analysis that tracks changes in land use and environment over 40 years, we present evidence of a process of agrarianization based on commercialization of crops and expansion of cultivated land. With the concept of livelihood strategies as an analytical frame-work, subcommunity processes are analyzed for their impact on intensification and degradation. Accumulating strategies are linked to expansion, commercial crop production, and selective intensification through high-value inputs, while at the other end of the scale, peasant-labor households endure exhausted or marginal potential land resources combined with lack of flexibility in input consumption. The article shows how degradation and intensification occur simultaneously and how incomes may increase even during processes of land degradation. We argue that a livelihood approach can be useful in uncovering and explaining these processes.","journal":"Economic Geography","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Historical foundations of reef science show that early applications of reef inquiries centered on environmental connection and inevitably led to establishing not only the baseline of reef ecosystems, but also contributed to the evolution of conservation crisis in this environment. This work applies Q-methodology towards determining attitudes, prioritizing statements and finding consensus regarding management issues that are tied to the science of coral reef environments and their conservation \" crisis\" This work delineates the social construction of attitudes, perceptions, and foundations of coral conservation science by examining the scientifically-grounded statements that constitute conservation debates. Study participants were comprised of the coral reef science and conservation professional network. The Q-sample (n = 43) was structured around some central debates over the dilemmas and strategies of reef management and decline-mitigation, both recent and long-running. Four attitudes or viewpoints were isolated in terms of their preferred management models, geographic perspectives and the role scientific findings play within these core beliefs. These can be generally described as Community and Locally-centered Humanists, Scientific Idealists, Skeptical and Utilitarian Pragmatists, and Politically-oriented Positivists. Evaluating agreement about central issues showed a high degree of consensus regarding the relative importance of community input in the role of successful reef management while the highest degree of contention was seen in scalar issues such as human-environment feedback systems that are inherent in solving environmental crises.

This study investigated the intensity of NTFP collection, the financial benefits gained through the collection of a representative species, and the contextual factors influencing NTFP collection and sale in 12 villages of the Baitadi district of far western Nepal. Thirty-nine per cent of the economically active population collected a total of 24 NTFPs from 23 species, which contributed 0-90% of the total household income. A marketing chain and financial analysis of Valeriana jatamansi (sugandhwal) revealed that various trading and marketing channels existed from the village to district-level NTFP outlets. The price received by the collector depended on the length of the market chain and the political context of the market. Political instability resulting from the Maoist insurgency reduced profits from sugandhwal sale by 23-25%. The number of NTFP-selling outlets accessed by collectors was the most important variable determining the number of NTFPs collected and the overall contribution of NTFPs to the household. Physical accessibility of the village did not impact the contribution of NTFPs to the household livelihood. The strength of NTFP-related institutions (both government and non-governmental organizations) decreased the total NTFP contribution to livelihoods because at the time of the study the villages were in transition to domestication of NTFPs. In the future, the contribution of domesticated NTFPs to households in villages with strong NTFP-related institutions should be much greater than at present. Increasing access to NTFP-selling outlets may be achieved through information dissemination, empowerment of collectors and establishment of linkages between collectors and traders. In general, domestication is an important strategy to ensure a continuous supply of NTFPs. Middlemen traders are seen as important stabilizers of prices as long as fair trading practices are followed. Monitoring of these villages over time will also provide important new quantitative information on the process of transition in rural villages changing from a forest-collection NTFP procurement strategy to a domestication procurement strategy.

Our proposed restoration framework addresses the ecology, economy and social issues simultaneously by considering the causes of mangrove degradation. We provide a step by step guideline for its restoration. We argue that although, ecological issues are of prime importance, economic and social issues must be considered in the restoration plan in order for it to be successful. Since mangrove ecology is not adequately studied in this region, local ecological knowledge can be used to fill the baseline information gaps. Unwanted human disturbance can be minimized by encouraging community participation. This can be ensured and sustained by facilitating the livelihood of the coastal community. We translated the restoration paradigm into a readily available practical guideline for the executors of the plans.

Despite the normative agenda of community-based natural resource management for social and ecological outcomes, a shift to multilevel or polycentric theorizing is warranted. Polycentric governance recognizes the importance of cross-scale interactions, as well as the horizontal and vertical institutional linkages of authority, networks, and markets in which community institutions are embedded. Based on qualitative community forestry research in Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada, this article explores the themes of livelihood and local economy, collaborative forest planning and participation, and environmental governance. Bottom-up empirical evidence suggests that viewing community forestry through a polycentric governance network is necessary for theorizing complex cross-scale dynamics. Incentivizing policies that encourage the development of polycentric systems for natural resource governance is important for maintaining local benefits, while increasing adaptive capacity to deal with complex social-ecological challenges.

In this paper, we apply participatory scenario processes to address the development of multifunctional forestry in these mountains by taking as an example the case study of Slovensky Raj National Park and specifically focusing on the involvement of local communities, particularly the Roma minority, in sustainable forest management (SFM). The paper argues that development of local institutions and promotion of horizontal and vertical participation to increase social capital is necessary for addressing social and economic problems, managing potential conflicts and sustaining multifunctional forestry development. The results suggest that the way forward is the integration of multi-purpose forest management with community development, and that learning, repeated stakeholder interaction, trust-building and cooperation between and within multiethnic local communities are important preconditions for success. The scenario process applied turned out to be beneficial for both the majority and the minority populations, particularly allowing for discussions about future development of mountain regions, their local economies and communities, and for providing some guidance about what are the preferred actions for participation in multifunctional SFM.","journal":"Small-Scale Forestry","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

M.","year":2008,"title":"Fisheries management and conservation in tropical estuaries - Is a balance possible?","dAbstract":"Tropical estuaries are often subject to very heavy human usage, and the variety of uses often leads to conflicts of interest. Their high fisheries productivity ensures that man is now very much part of the ecology of tropical estuaries. Although the major threats to estuarine fishes are usually linked to environmental degradation, there is also evidence to suggest that many fish species in tropical estuaries, particularly in south and southeast Asia, are declining in abundance primarily as a result of overfishing. Developed countries accord great importance to the conservation of ecosystems for their heritage value and in order to preserve fauna and flora, but in the developing world, the importance of estuaries for fisheries production and food security may seem at odds with arguments for their conservation. However, unlike many other human activities in and around estuaries, fisheries are almost completely dependent on the maintenance of ecosystem integrity. Both fisheries and conservation require sustainability as an outcome of management. Notwithstanding environmental problems, management therefore necessitates balancing the demands of fisheries and conservation. Examples show that this is possible, but there is little doubt that attempts to conserve estuaries in the tropics that do not take into account human activities are doomed to failure. The sustainable use of estuaries has, in some cases, become an integral part of the ecology of those systems, and fisheries form important criteria for designation of estuaries as internationally important under the RAMSAR convention.","journal":"Book Section","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Such management may be particularly suitable,2 for diadromous fishes, which spend time in rivers, estuaries, and the sea, because their sustainability Would benefit front a holistic approach. The extent to which this is possible and has been successful depends on a wide variety of biological, socioeconomic, and political factors. Fishing in all its forms is only one of a broad at-ray of human activities in rivers, estuaries, and the coastal zone; hence, diadromous fisheries management requires not only integration across ecosystems, but also its inclusion in overall planning processes. Tropical diadromous fisheries in developing countries suffer from overfishing, lack of adequate human resources to manage the fisheries, insufficient scientific data for sound management and decision making, lack of monitoring capabilities, poor enforcement of laws, inefficient administration, and increasing conflicts between different types Of users. Even in developed Countries, many of these issues also have not been addressed. The extent to which an EBFM approach has been Successful for tropical diadromous species is discussed using the various barramundi Lates calcarifer, Mullet (Mugilidae), and tropical shad (Tenualosa) fisheries of Asia and Australia, taking into account issues of food security and the role of community-based management.","journal":"Book Section","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

In principle, these problems can be mitigated by supplementing government financing with contributions from leading environmental service users. We use original survey data and official statistics to analyze user financing in Costa Rica's renowned national PES program, focusing on the amounts and sources of user financing, the drivers of contributions, and contributors' perceptions of the PES program. We find that user financing has supported less than 3% of the acres enrolled in the program and that hydroelectric plants are the largest private sector contributors. Large hydroelectric plants tend to contribute while small ones do not. The weight of evidence suggests that in addition to ensuring the provision of forest environmental services, hydroelectric plants' motives for contributing to the PES program include improving relations with local communities and government regulators-common drivers of participation in all manner of voluntary environmental programs. These findings raise questions about the potential of user financing to improve the efficiency and financial sustainability of national PES programs. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The most critical issues are linked with a poor analytical framework. and a lack of common unit for the aggregation. Some measure directly the state of the environment while other use proxies such as pressure or response indicators or even a mix of these. A new composite index for environmental sustainability was developed in the EU project EPSILON, which aimed at assessing European regional sustainability for policy decision making related to the improvement of regional sustainability. Indicators are expressed according to a coherent framework issuing from the 'driving force-pressure-state-impact-response' approach with an innovative weighting scheme derived from human health impact assessment based on disability adjusted life years (DALYs).

In protected areas, legislation restricts the population's access to natural food resources, which might have an impact on their welfare. Objective. To assess the contribution of the individual use of natural resources to nutritional status in the rural population of the Gamba Complex of Gabon. Methods. Four villages were selected to represent the rural population. All households were invited to participate, and 95% agreed. In each of the two major seasons, data were collected from all individuals (n = 637) in these 95 households during a 7-day period using a weighed food-consumption survey, observations, interviews, and anthropometric measures. Results. Among children 5 to 9 years of age (n = 82) and adolescents (n = 169), their use of natural resources was the best predictor of nutritional status (explaining 8% of the variance), mainly via its contribution to the achievement of nutrient requirements. The use of natural resources was not a predictor for children 6 to 23 months (n = 28) or 24 to 59 months of age (n = 63), where the best predictors were access to care (26%) and health status (15%), respectively. Household food security predicted nutritional status in women caregivers (n = 96), although negatively. Conclusions. Natural resources contribute to the nutritional status of children 5 to 9 years of age and adolescents but not of other groups. The intrahouse-hold allocation of food, particularly of natural food resources, needs to be investigated to better appreciate the contribution of natural resources to the population's well-being. Women seem particularly vulnerable. Other than activities related to conservation, work is needed to understand the role of natural resources for populations living within and around protected areas.

In this paper, we present an analysis of the prospects of a community-based plantation using taungya systems and indigenous trees as means to forest rehabilitation and livelihood improvement in Ghana. The project management strategies, communication process and incentive mechanism and their impact on local participation are discussed with the aim to recommending a mechanism through which local farmers can best be involved in rehabilitation of degraded sites in the future in Ghana. Data were collected through a survey using personal interviews of 431 farming households and ten key informants from ten communities living in scattered hamlets in and around forests reserves. The results show a high rate of local participation in project tree planting activities. Four years after the project's initiation, about 250 ha of plantations had been established using twelve priority indigenous and one exotic species and farmers had indicated improvement in their farming practices and availability of food and forest products. Restoring forest quality as a timber resource and associated values, getting money, food stuff and timber and non-timber for domestic use, and having access to fertile land for farming were the top three issues prioritised by respondents as motivational factors for engaging in the project activities. Overall, this project demonstrates that reversing tropical forest degradation is possible. For this we need local involvement in tree domestication combined with activities that addresses livelihood needs and environmental concerns. This case also demonstrates the prospects of utilising indigenous tree species, not only exotic species that dominated tree planting in the past, for plantations and landscape rehabilitation in Ghana.

Using two North Sea prohibited trawling areas (PTAs) established > 80 years ago, social (fishers' perceptions), management (fishing effort and compliance) and ecological (fish abundance and size) data were combined to assess the PTAs against their primary societal (conflict resolution) and secondary ecological (stock protection) objectives. Fishers perceived that the PTAs resolved conflicts between static and mobile gear sectors, despite evidence of non-compliance. However, few fishers perceived that they personally benefited from the PTAs. Fish abundance and size data from baited traps (BT) and video (BV) provided no evidence of PTA effects, but trawling effort was a significant predictor of BT fish abundance data and improved the model of BV fish abundance data. The absence of PTA effects on fish is attributable to non-compliance, the high mobility of the fish involved and their continued exploitation within the PTAs using static gear. This points to the need for greater understanding of the behaviour of fishers in relation to closures. The study also highlights the challenges of quantifying possible fishery benefits of small temperate closed areas and questions whether widely advocated fishery benefits may have enhanced initial support, but failure to deliver them may erode faith in such closures as a fisheries management tool.

The leaves are important because they are used for hand-rolling of Beedis, a local cigarette. It is not only an extremely important non-timber forest product that serves as a big revenue earner for the state government but is also an important economic resource to the indigenous tribes and local population during the summer months when they have no other form of employment. Tendu leaves are collected during the months of April to June., primarily from pruned shrubby growth since the pruned leaves are higher in quality. The leaves are then sun dried for a week and stored in gunny bags. The trade has tremendous socio-economic value to the local population and is a source of income to them in the economically tight summer months. Due to extreme exploitation of the collectors, who are mostly local indigenous people, the state government had established state control over its collection and trade as early as in 1964. Cooperatives were formed later in 1989, with the establishment of a three tier cooperative structure. The state and the central governments have continuously sought to empower the local populations, and several steps have been taken to establish ownership rights of the collectors over non-timber forest products. This has culminated in the 73(rd) constitutional amendment in 1996 that has given the ownership right over non-timber forest products to the gram sabhas (local groups or entities). There is an established network of selling agents composed of wholesalers and retailers. Some big companies also export some beedis (local cigarettes) to neighboring countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal and to distant countries such as the United States, France, African and West Asian countries. The quality and sustainable harvesting of the leaves has received a boost due to the new Joint Forest Management Strategy initiated by the state government.","journal":"Book Section","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

The history of the region is described and the conservation and development impacts of external drivers of change are assessed. Both government and conservation organizations have subscribed to the rhetoric of pursuing development pathways that would be sustainable and would conserve the rich biodiversity of the area. Three distinct approaches to conservation have been attempted. First spatial planning has been used to attribute land to different uses and particularly to identify and designate protected areas. Second, measures have been taken to lessen the negative environmental impact of industrial logging and to promote the preservation of biodiversity in logged forests. Last, decentralized and community-based management has been promoted on the assumption that this would yield better environmental and social outcomes than large-scale industrial development. These conservation measures have been pursued during a period when the governance of the region has been weak. Corruption, political collusion, and nepotism have been major factors in decision making about natural resources. We argue that a sustainable future for the district of Malinau must lie in finding an appropriate balance between protected areas, forests managed at both industrial and community scales, and land conversion. However, there is little empirical evidence that allows the outcomes of these approaches to be measured. The problem of knowing how conservation investments can be made in ways that optimize sustainable benefits to local livelihoods remains largely unresolved. A number of possible conservation and development pathways for the district are discussed.

Lessons learnt from the development of a multi-stakeholder system in Northern Laos","dAbstract":"Monitoring natural resources is essential for their successful and sustainable management. Community participation should enable local people to take ownership of the monitoring and ensure that it is cost-effective. But even then, success is often elusive. We developed a participatory Non Timber Forest Product (NTFP) monitoring system in 6 upland villages of Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR, using focus group discussions, interviews, village meetings and direct observations. We used simple approaches to select resources, discuss issues, and develop a cost-effective NTFP monitoring system. Communities usually relied on shifting cultivation, fishing and collection of NTFPs. Gold mining activities affected livelihoods in three villages, which had better access to markets. Participatory monitoring looks less successful when external economic pressures or a major environmental threat disturbs local livelihoods. In the case of gold mining, we observed the prioritization of villagers' activities towards this sudden new economic opportunity. In contrast, communities not impacted by mining participated more actively in data collection. They understood how the data could be used to influence the local government, to achieve more beneficial land management for all stakeholders concerned. We believe that participatory NTFP monitoring can work and is an important tool for decision-making and economic empowerment for local communities. We identified the conditions under which participatory NTFP monitoring could work: reaching a shared understanding of what needs to be monitored and how; testing and refining a simple monitoring system; and integrating local government concerns with those of other stakeholders.

A multidisciplinary approach","dAbstract":"Rapid appraisal methods are often criticized by the scientific community for their superficiality and the otten contested quality of information that they provide. It is however crucial to propose rigorous methods that meet the demands of development institutions and decision makers, beyond academic and long-term survey techniques. In the context of biodiversity research, the MLA (Multidisciplinary Landscape Assessment) - a set of methods developed by CIFOR (Center for International Forestry Research) - assesses the reasons for which resources and landscapes are important for forest communities and the implications for biodiversity and conservation. It is built on both social sciences (socio-economics, anthropology, ethno-botany) and natural sciences (ecology, botany, soil science). Taking experiences in the field in Cameroon, Gabon, the Philippines, Vietnam, Kalimantan and West Papua, we analyze the ways in which MLA can meet the different expectations without falling into the traps of conventional rapid appraisal methods. We conclude that this multidisciplinary approach is a flexible diagnostic tool that can serve as a basis for more in depth and longer-term studies. In this type of study, special care should be taken regarding ethical issues as well as the local impacts of research on the longer term and the dissemination of results amongst the targeted communities.

Results show that each family depends upon the diversification of productive activities in order to meet economic needs. Diversification of activities is carried out in both space and time, making use of different ecosystems during varied seasons throughout the year. Women's activities correspond to housekeeping and house administration; they take care of home gardens and are responsible for water collection and wood gathering. Men carry out the activities of working in the milpa, cattle raising, honey production, chicle collection, and wood felling.

Protected areas were established decades ago in order to preserve the forest's unique biodiversity from being converted into agricultural land by the regions large number of small-scale farmers. Nonetheless, recent research shows that degradation continues at alarming rates. In this paper we address an important challenge faced by protected area management, namely, the design of a cost-effective incentive scheme that balances local demand for subsistence non-timber forest products against conservation interests. Using primary data collected from 369 randomly selected farm-households we combine a farm-household classification with mathematical programming in order to estimate the opportunity costs of conserving the Kakamega Forest and restricting access to non-timber forest product resources.

A synopsis of the experience of South African practitioners is provided in this study of 65 outreach nurseries. South African outreach nurseries frequently include financial objectives, creating additional challenges in simultaneously attaining conservation and socioeconomic goals. Progress was hindered by biophysical problems (e.g., lack of water, poor soils, etc.) as well as the harsh socioeconomic conditions facing most communities in which nurseries had been established. Attaining financial viability was challenging. Business management skills were often restricted, and few viability studies included adequate market research. Costs to community participants were usually high, and benefits were limited. Conservation objectives were frequently lost in the struggle to attain financial viability. The management of social processes also proved challenging. Although small scale and relatively straightforward compared with many ICDPs, nurseries usually require substantial institutional support, including a range of technical, business, and development services. Project time frames need to be reconsidered, as practitioners estimate that it takes 5-10 years for nurseries to start meeting objectives, and donors and implementing agencies often operate on 2-3-year project cycles. Detailed viability studies are essential, incorporating a social probe and an assessment of potential impacts of projects on community participants. Progress needs to be continuously evaluated to enable institutions and community participants to adapt to changing conditions as well as ensure that the spectrum of objectives are being achieved.

This social learning process was introduced by researchers affiliated with national research institutions to improve land use planning practices and increase the ownership of local people in the planning process. Twelve members of the village land management committees participated in the role play called \"PLUP Fiction,\" which is part of a stepwise process of participatory land use planning (PLUP). This article introduces the principles of land zoning, the sequence of events presented during the role play session, and the lessons learned from a series of experiments conducted in remote upland villages. The villagers gained an increased understanding of the issues at stake during a zoning process, thus demonstrating the relevance of this learning simulation tool. They were able to explore different zoning options, assess their respective advantages and constraints, and gradually improve their understanding of the consequences of land zoning on the environmental and economic values of the resulting landscape. The villagers also felt empowered by their newly acquired knowledge and well disposed toward negotiations to improve their current land use through more realistic plans. Long-term environmental concerns (ie biodiversity and carbon values) were fully integrated with shorter-term economic considerations in the collective decision-making process. Furthermore, \"PLUP Fiction\" has become a key tool for fully involving local communities in Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) through negotiations that are taking place during a land use planning process.

In this article, two modes - co-management (CM) and adaptive co-management (ACM) - are analysed in detail, and an examination is made of an attempt to put these modes sequentially into practice in the first (2003-2009) and second (2008-2013) management plans, respectively, of the Cayos Cochinos MPA (CCMPA) in Honduras. Extensive fieldwork was carried out during 2006-2010 in three communities dependent on the CCMPA (Rio Esteban, Nueva Armenia, and Chachahuate) including key informant interviews, focus group meetings, household surveys, and participant observation. The paper's findings are (1) that while the first plan implemented some CM principles (such as sharing responsibility between government, stakeholders and NGOs) it failed to deliver other CM principles (such as transparency and accountability); and (2) that while the second plan increased participation and transparency, and used a more adaptive approach, it still left many stakeholders out of the decision-making process, and its processes of experimentation, monitoring and social learning were very limited. The fact is that CM and ACM are laudable objectives, but very difficult to implement in full. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Advocates argue that forestry projects have significant potential for sequestering carbon, contributing to livelihood improvements, and promoting sustainable development in developing countries-especially African countries with predominately agrarian economies and relatively high GHG emissions from land-use change. Through a comparison of two carbon-forestry projects in central Tanzania, we investigated both the livelihood effects of these projects and the risk and benefit perceptions of project administrators and the government. Both projects have been unable to gain national government approval, and we find evidence of mixed benefits for local communities. Village communities participating in one program consistently identified environmental and social benefits of planting trees locally and judged them as more important than carbon payments. A key variable is ownership, as villagers that have forfeited their land to a plantation have little stake in the program, whereas villagers participating in a community-based program own their trees. Our results suggest that enhancing ties to local ownership can contribute to sustainable development while better enhancing the potential of the carbon market to work for the rural poor in developing countries.

To achieve this objective we use a multinomial choice model of engagement (or non-engagement) in forest management activities based on household data from 4 villages surrounding the National Kabore Tambi Park in Burkina Faso. The results show that the participation by household members in forest conservation activities is mainly determined by the three variables that are related to policy: membership in community based forest management associations, security of land use rights, and training. The current training programs focus only on forest conservation practices. To be more efficient it should focus on increasing people's knowledge about the benefits due to conservation and the threats resulting from the lack of forest management. Furthermore the results indicate that improving land use right security would increase farmer's willingness to participate in forest management activities such as community work and forest surveillance. Thus particular attention should be paid to the prevailing system of land rights and its incentives, or disincentives, for promoting sustainable management of the forest resource.

An evaluation of Ecuador's SocioPÃ¡ramo program","dAbstract":"PES programs have been touted as a means to achieve conservation goals while also alleviating poverty and promoting rural development. However, the degree to which these goals are met depends, in part, on accessibility and desirability of programs targeting rural communities and smallholders. Empirical research on factors motivating or dissuading PES landowner participation remains limited and a more complete understanding of these factors is critical to improving PES social equity outcomes. In this paper, we evaluate factors facilitating and constraining participation in Ecuador's SocioPÃ¡ramo program, a recently launched PES initiative targeting highland Andean grasslands (pÃ¡ramos). We conducted semi-structured interviews with all community landowner participants who had enrolled by May 2011, the majority of individual landowner participants who had enrolled by October 2010, and several non-participant communities and individuals. We found that, while SocioPÃ¡ramo is attracting substantial participation among rural farmers and communities, a number of factors, including land tenure requirements, legal or biophysical land-use restrictions, and a need for pre-existing social, human, and financial capital, make SocioPÃ¡ramo more accessible and desirable to larger, and often wealthier, landowners. While motivations for enrolling in the program varied, a key similarity among participants was access to alternative livelihood sources, a low opportunity cost associated with program land-use regulations, and a high value placed on the water provisioning services of the pÃ¡ramo. The majority of participants described incentives as a \"reward\" for conserving, as a means to strengthen existing conservation efforts or land security, or as a means to compensate for legal or biophysical land use restrictions. Our results suggest that the broader context of land tenure security, access to social capital, environmental attitudes, and alternative livelihood strategy development may require more attention in order to achieve greater participation among rural smallholders and communities. These results provide useful lessons for developing and adapting this and other PES programs so that they can better meet social goals.

First of all, in the team, we have a PhD in African Development, specialized in ecological tourism and pursuing the Post Doctoral research, two master degrees in African tourism, a MBA and a PhD student in environmental issues.The main theoretical background is the development alternative approach complemented by the ecological tourism concept and the evaluation indicators and methods about the impacts of the practice increase in the community life and environment balance. Sao Tome e Principe is a small insular and African country in development (SIDS). It is an archipelago that is endowed with a diversified environmental patrimony where it is possible to identify and to classify different protected areas in agreement with the international indicators. Some examples are the Natural Park Obo in the two main islands (Sao Tome and Principe islands) and the Ecological Areas (Malanza and Praia das Conchas), characterized by the biodiversity and endemic flora and fauna in the forest, coastal and sea areas. The archipelago has many natural potentialities that are adapted to the ecological tourism and the observation practice. On the other hand, it is a country with abundance of natural resources that are the maintenance of the local community who are dependent of the nature to guarantee the family survival, developing traditional cultural practices, exercising and added load in the environment. In spite of the Government considered and recognized officially the importance of the ecological segment in 2000, at present in Sao Tome and Principe tourism is still a marginal sector. The participation and the local community empowerment in the ecological tourism projects with environmental preservation had been valued in the last years. Some examples are the important societies or partnerships with community groups, local associations and Non Governmental Organizations in coastal areas as well as in rural context. Because of the importance of the education in the development, concerning to make certain the local poverty relief as well as the improvement of the community abilities, the care about the environment education is real, especially when we analyse the ecological tourism experiences. In Sao Tome and Principe it is already visible the concern with the environmental education and the formation for the nature preservation and the conservation of the threatened animals in extinction. Those fragile species have a decisive importance for the ecological tourism practice but are a preferred target for the local consumption. The target groups of the education actions are both, the youth and scholar population as well as the working people like the small fisher, the fish sellers and the artisans. The research indicates that in Sao Tome and Principe something is changing slowly but it is already possible to identify some transformation signs in the local people mentality and practices.","journal":"Amfiteatru Economic","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}
{"author":"Brooks, J. S.","year":2010,"title":"Economic and social dimensions of environmental behavior: Balancing conservation and development in Bhutan","dAbstract":"One of the primary approaches to environmental conservation emphasizes economic development. This conservation-and-development approach often ignores how development affects sociocultural characteristics that may motivate environmental behaviors (actions that actively benefit or limit one's negative impacts on the environment). Evolutionary anthropologists espouse a theoretical perspective that supports the conservation-and-development approach. Others believe sociocultural factors are the foundation of environmental behavior and worry that development will erode the values and norms that may shape such behavior. My research assistants and I surveyed 170 individuals from eight villages in two communities in Bhutan to explore whether economic (wealth, market integration) or social (religious behaviors, environmental values, social capital) factors are better indicators of environmental behavior. I used multilevel modeling to analyze use of fuelwood, use of agricultural chemicals, and tree planting, and to determine whether social norms were associated with these behaviors. Although economic factors were more often associated with these behaviors than social factors, local conditions and control variables were the best indicators of behaviors. Furthermore, economic factors were not always associated with positive environmental outcomes. Instead, farmers attempted to make the best economic decisions given their circumstances rather than seeking to conserve resources. Although religion was not a strong predictor of any of the behaviors I examined, I found evidence that the understanding of Buddhist philosophy is growing, which suggests that social factors may play a more prominent role as Bhutan's development progresses. My results highlight the need for conservation planners to be aware of local conditions when planning and implementing policies aimed at motivating environmental behaviors and that economic and social motivations for conservation may not be mutually exclusive.

However, CBC projects are neither consistently successful nor free of controversy. Innovative recent studies evaluating the factors associated with success and failure typically examine only a single resource domain, have limited geographic scope, consider only one outcome, or ignore the nested nature of socioecological systems. To remedy these issues, we use a global comparative database of CBC projects identified by systematic review to evaluate success in four outcome domains (attitudes, behaviors, ecological, economic) and explore synergies and trade-offs among these outcomes. We test hypotheses about how features of the national context, project design, and local community characteristics affect these measures of success. Using bivariate analyses and multivariate proportional odds logistic regressions within a multilevel analysis and model-fitting framework, we show that project design, particularly capacity-building in local communities, is associated with success across all outcomes. In addition, some characteristics of the local community in which projects are conducted, such as tenure regimes and supportive cultural beliefs and institutions, are important for project success. Surprisingly, there is little evidence that national context systematically influences project outcomes.We also find evidence of synergies between pairs of outcomes, particularly between ecological and economic success. We suggest that well-designed and implemented projects can overcome many of the obstacles imposed by local and national conditions to succeed in multiple domains.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Seasonal livelihood strategies and resource conservation by tonle sap fishers in Cambodia","dAbstract":"This paper situates concerns for conservation of aquatic snakes and livelihood sustainability in Cambodia within a social-ecological systems context and thereby presents a challenge to conventional species-based conservation programmes. Fishing for low-value water snakes has become a widespread activity within the floating communities of Tonle Sap Lake in the last 20 years in response to new market opportunities, provided primarily by a crocodile farming industry. The scale and intensity of this new form of exploitation and reports of declines in catch per fisher have highlighted this activity as a conservation concern, yet its role within local livelihood strategies was previously unknown. We show that it is of increasing importance to the less well-off, and is linked to higher incomes within this group, where it potentially reduces their vulnerability to fluctuations and declines in fish catches. It is particularly important as a means to smooth seasonality of incomes in this flood pulse-driven social-ecological system. We argue that shifts between snake-hunting and fishing, as a market-driven adaptive livelihood strategy by the poor, may be more compatible with wider ecosystem conservation and development goals than alternatives such as increased fishing effort or converting floodplain habitats for seasonal agriculture.

Given the rapid and widespread urbanization occurring throughout sub-Saharan Africa, in particular Malawi, these challenges will be increasingly concentrated in cities. However, climate change and sustainable development policies in Malawi focus largely on rural areas. As a consequence, the new environmental and demographic challenges facing cities and the clear and immediate need for spatial planning are not addressed. This paper draws on current literature to make the linkages between climate change adaptation and spatial planning and to investigate the potential of densification and disaster risk management as adaptation measures. However, policy gaps, the acute shortages of trained land professionals and arrested political decentralization remain significant challenges for policy implementation. The recommendations outlined in this paper are intended to inform more appropriate adaptations over the long term by identifying where further research is required and by identifying specific actions that can be taken by policymakers to improve Malawi's planned adaptation in urban areas. Due to the lack of research that exists on climate change adaptation from an urban perspective in Malawi, this paper is intended to provoke wider discussions of this subject across the planning, development and environmental management community.

Forests surrounding the township of Humbo were largely destroyed by the late 1960s. In 2004, World Vision Australia and World Vision Ethiopia identified forestry-based carbon sequestration as a potential means to stimulate community development while engaging in environmental restoration. After two years of consultation, planning and negotiations, the Humbo Community-based Natural Regeneration Project began implementation-the Ethiopian organization's first carbon sequestration initiative. The Humbo Project assists communities affected by environmental degradation including loss of biodiversity, soil erosion and flooding with an opportunity to benefit from carbon markets while reducing poverty and restoring the local agroecosystem. Involving the regeneration of 2,728 ha of degraded native forests, it brings social, economic and ecological benefits-facilitating adaptation to a changing climate and generating temporary certified emissions reductions (tCERs) under the Clean Development Mechanism. A key feature of the project has been facilitating communities to embrace new techniques and take responsibility for large-scale environmental change, most importantly involving Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). This technique is low-cost, replicable, and provides direct benefits within a short time. Communities were able to harvest fodder and firewood within a year of project initiation and wild fruits and other non-timber forest products within three years. Farmers are using agroforestry for both environmental restoration and income generation. Establishment of user rights and local cooperatives has generated community ownership and enthusiasm for this project-empowering the community to more sustainably manage their communal lands.

This paper examines some of the difficulties that the multi-dimensional nature of the concept poses in devising conservation and development policies. It explores these issues with reference to field-based research in Nepal. The case study identifies the different interest groups and stakeholders involved in biodiversity conservation and analyses the policy prescriptions they promote. It highlights inadequacies in scientific understanding of the dynamics of complex systems; the lack of historic data on resource use; and crucially, the use/misuse of existing data by different interests. Conventional wisdom dictates that local people's utilisation of resources in areas where biodiversity is high is in conflict with conservation and tourism. Access to and extraction of resources are therefore strictly controlled. The conceptualisation of biodiversity, the causes of its degradation and the solutions offered by conservation stakeholders thus has implications not only for conservation, but critically for the livelihoods and welfare of people in poor countries.","journal":"ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The approach combines stake-holder analysis and environmental valuation within a framework of multiple criteria analysis. It uses stakeholder participation in an iterative process to derive weights for economic, social and ecological criteria. It aims to develop a decision-making tool which enables different stakeholders' perspectives and values to be explicitly included in the analysis. This approach is developed within the context of a multiple use marine protected area, the Buccoo Reef Marine Park in Tobago, West Indies. Such resources are crucial both in terms of the close environmental interactions in coastal zones and in terms of their economic and recreational use linkages, particularly within small island developing countries. The model uses eight criteria which cover social, ecological and economic aspects. The economic criteria assessed are the contribution of tourism to the macro-economy of Trinidad and Tobago; and the consumer surplus associated with recreational use of the marine protected area. The social criteria are the jobs for Tobagon-ians in tourism; the number of people whose livelihoods depend on informal tourism-related activities; and local access to the marine park for extractive and recreational uses. The ecological criteria include indicators of mangrove productivity; sea grass distribution; and coral reef quality. These criteria are both quantitative and qualitative and are assessed using various primary data collection methods and models. Methods for estimation of these criteria under different development scenarios and their incorporation into the multi-criteria framework are outlined. Preliminary results demonstrate that there are evident trade-offs between the different criteria, and that different stakeholders rank or weight these criteria differently. However, involvement by stakeholders in the process of developing the model, and in discussing the recommendations derived from different weightings, provides an opportunity to explore and construct different develop-ment outcomes. This makes explicit the different perceptions and values of the different actors, which creates an opportunity for decision making and management based on consensus rather than conflict. The paper argues that such an approach is likely to lead to sustainable resource management in a variety of contexts.","journal":"Serial","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a key protected area in eastern Madagascar, Ranomafana National Park (RNP). We established paired 100 Ã— 4-m vegetation transects (400 m 2) within RNP and in remnant forests in the park's peripheral zone. In each 400-m 2 plot, all woody stems &gt;1.5 cm in diameter at breast height were measured and identified to species. All species were also identified as native or non-native. We identified utilitarian species within all transects and they were sorted into use category. We calculated plot-level taxonomic biodiversity and functional diversity of utilitarian species; the latter was calculated by clustering the multivariate distances between species based on their utilitarian traits, and all metrics were tested using paired t-tests. Our results showed that there was significantly higher biodiversity inside RNP than in remnant forests and this pattern was consistent across all diversity metrics examined. Forests not located within the park's boundary had significantly higher non-native species than within RNP. There was no statistically significant difference in functional diversity of utilitarian species inside RNP vs. remnant forests; however, the overall trend was toward higher diversity inside park boundaries. These findings suggested that RNP has been effective at maintaining taxonomic diversity relative to surrounding unprotected areas and restricting the spread of non-native plants. The results also suggested that low functional redundancy of forests outside of RNP might be of concern, because residents in surrounding villages may have few other substitutes for the services provided by species that are of critical importance to their livelihoods.

We apply a functional diversity metric originally developed for addressing questions in community ecology to assess utilitarian diversity of 56 forest plots in Madagascar. The use categories for utilitarian plants were determined using expert knowledge and household questionnaires. We used a null model approach to examine the utilitarian (functional) diversity and utilitarian redundancy present within ecological communities. Additionally, variables that might influence fluctuations in utilitarian diversity and redundancy-specifically number of felled trees, number of trails, basal area, canopy height, elevation, distance from village-were analyzed using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Eighteen of the 56 plots showed utilitarian diversity values significantly higher than expected. This result indicates that these habitats exhibited a low degree of utilitarian redundancy and were therefore comprised of plants with relatively distinct utilitarian properties. One implication of this finding is that minor losses in species richness may result in reductions in utilitarian diversity and redundancy, which may limit local residents' ability to switch between alternative choices. The GLM analysis showed that the most predictive model included basal area, canopy height and distance from village, which suggests that variation in utilitarian redundancy may be a result of local residents harvesting resources from the protected area. Our approach permits an assessment of the diversity of provisioning services available to local communities, offering unique insights that would not be possible using traditional taxonomic diversity measures. These analyses introduce another tool available to conservation biologists for assessing how future losses in biodiversity will lead to a reduction in natural resources and provisioning services from forests.

In light of these threats, questions remain about how societies on the forest fringe who depend on provisioning services affect plant functional traits. This study assessed the relationship between plant functional traits, forest-dependent societies and provisioning ecosystem services along a forest-agriculture matrix gradient in tropical humid forests of Madagascar. Data were collected for six functional traits and six provisioning services. We evaluated functional diversity (FD) and utilitarian diversity (FD of provisioning services) along disturbance gradients. We also determined the traits most susceptible to loss along the gradient as well as the relationship between functional traits and provisioning services. The results showed that FD, utilitarian diversity and species richness decreased significantly across all modified habitats. There was a distinct suite of traits absent from intensely used habitats and those same traits were associated with the two most important provisioning services in the region (firewood and construction). The activities of people living on the forest fringe seem to be a strong selective force on trait loss in plant communities, which in turn will influence future species assembly and trait diversity and distribution. Moreover, this study suggests that it is possible to predict trait loss from plant communities in forests where degradation is mediated primarily through subsistence agriculture and resource extraction. Conservation efforts should recognize that forest degradation and deforestation are contextually specific, determined mostly by people's efforts to maintain their basic livelihood, and therefore necessitate local-scale interventions that feed into landscape-scale policy initiatives.

This article examines the differences between two stakeholder groups in the Samburu region of central Kenya: (1) protected area leadership and staff; and (2) members of the communities adjacent to the protected areas. Based on the results and analysis of 30 in-depth interviews, the authors identify differences between protected area staff and their community members regarding perceptions about communication between the two groups, and the economic benefits of tourism. The different stakeholders agreed, however, about challenges related to equitable distribution of tourism-based employment and revenue. The results indicate a need to reach consensus about what constitutes sufficient communication between national reserves and their community, and to what extent tourism-related revenue and employment should be distributed within the region. A discussion of the potential role of indicators and standards to make such decisions is presented.

It may affect the renewability of the resources which in turn affects the livelihoods of local communities relying on those resources unless managed soundly. To understand how sound management of the fishery resources could be achieved together with the fishermen community, this paper analyses the sensibility of a community-based management of the natural ecosystem as a means to enhance the economic wellbeing of local small-scale fishermen. Two case studies were conducted in Malaysia for this purpose wherein the success factors of the community based fishery resource management projects (the Komuniti Pengurusan Sumber Perikanan or KPSP) initiated by the Malaysian Department of Fishery were scrutinised. It was found that the main reason for the projects' success was the existence of an implementation will to redress the triple problems of legal ownership, access to ecosystems and political marginalization of the fishermen. In conclusion, the KPSP model represented approaches worthy of further emulation in the developing world although further research would show the way how the model could be improved and customised according to the unique contexts of other fishermen communities.

What is the potential contribution of wildlife domestication?","dAbstract":"Community forest management is often advanced as a remedy for failing top-down approaches to nature conservation. Contingent on the property rights theory, it assumes that local participation in natural resource management results in sustainable structures. There is, however, insufficient empirical evidence on the intra-community dynamics-especially when households have unequal access to the local institutions managing the natural resource. This paper looks at the socio-cultural, economic and institutional situation of households with and without access to management institutions in communities around the Kilum-Ijim Mountain Forest in Cameroon and analyses whether livelihood differences are associated with variations in management patterns. The analysis reveals differences by household type and a mixed picture of the evolution of species in the community forests over time, questioning the role of the community in natural resource conservation. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potentials of wildlife domestication for livelihoods and conservation in forest communities. The results are important in the light of ongoing conservation efforts in natural resource hot-spots in sub-Saharan Africa.

Nevertheless, unlike protection of existing areas, restoration changes existing land use and can therefore be more controversial. Some restoration projects negatively affect surrounding landowners, creating social constraints to restoration success. Just as negative off-site impacts (i.e., negative externalities) flow from industrial areas to natural areas, restoration projects can generate negative externalities for commercial land uses, such as agriculture. Negative externalities from industry have led to government regulation to prevent human health and environmental impacts. Negative externalities from restoration projects have elicited similar legal constraint on at least one large-scale conservation project, riparian restoration in the Sacramento River Conservation Area. The negative externalities of restoration that are perceived to be the direct result of specific goals, such as endangered species management, are likely to be more contentious than externalities arising from unintended phenomena such as weed invasion. Restoration planners should give equal consideration to off-site characteristics as to on-site characteristics when choosing sites for restoration and designing projects. Efforts to control externalities can lead to off-site ecological benefits.

Environmental aspects are little studied, with similar to 1,500 publications in total. Impacts range from global contributions to climate change and ocean pollution to localized effects on endangered plant and animal species in protected areas. Environmental management is limited more by lack of adoption than by lack of technology. Government regulation is more effective than industry-based ecocertification. In developing nations, tourism can contribute to conservation by providing political and financial support for public protected area agencies and for conservation on private and communally owned lands. This is important in building resilience to climate change. In developed nations, such effects are outweighed by the impacts of recreational use and by political pressures from tourism property developers. These interactions deserve research in both natural and social sciences. Research priorities include more sophisticated recreation ecology as well as legal and social frameworks for conservation tourism.","journal":"Book Section","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Nepal has adopted a community-based approach to conservation management, including sharing of revenues from protected areas with local people living in the buffer zones around protected areas . The aim is to mitigate conflicts. This paper discusses the evolution of conservation policy for buffer zones in Nepal. The strengths and weaknesses of buffer zone policy are analysed, and the efforts to put policy into practice are examined and discussed. The analysis of buffer zone initiatives reveals that there are inconsistencies between the vision of the programme and its policies and practices. For better integration of conservation and development objectives, empowerment and equity in benefit sharing and gender issues need to be adequately incorporated in buffer zone policy and programme implementation.

Among the English-speaking subsample (n = 219; adjusted response rate 87.6%), respondents had moderate levels of place identity and place dependence and exhibited a tendency toward pro-environmental attitudes. Additionally, stronger place identity was significantly associated with greater agreement regarding the balance between humans and nature as well as with weaker support for the domination of humans over nature. No significant relationships between place identity and ecological limits or place dependence and environmental attitudes emerged. Results suggest emotional connections with places contribute toward pro-environmental attitudes. Enhancing such connections is therefore likely to lead to increased environmental care and concern.","journal":"Society & Natural Resources","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

This paper's goal was to better understand the effect of a particular class of disturbance-the accumulative effects of routine stressors-in the context of marine social-ecological systems. To that effect, we built a system dynamics model using empirically collected institutional and biological field data of an artisanal fishery in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Among our findings, we identified different scenarios under which even very small endogenous changes in the relationship between ecological and institutional variables can send a seemingly resilient system into a trajectory of collapse. We discuss why these types of disturbances are so difficult to prevent and be identified by the users of the resource, as well as potential strategies to address these challenges.","journal":"Sustainability Science","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

In order to reduce soil erosion on sloped lands, the Chinese government has responded by implementing large-scale, ecological rehabilitation programs, including the \" Grain for Green\" reforestation project. This program involves financial incentives to transition farmers into other economic activities with the goal of reducing ecological pressures and degradation. Because of the scope and potential impacts from these programs, detailed research is needed to understand their social and ecological effects. This paper reports on research conducted in Tianquan County, Sichuan Province, and Wuqi County, Shaanxi Province, that evaluates the effects of the program upon local economies and household livelihood systems. The paper argues that the successful conversion of farmland under \" Grain for Green\" depends upon local government involvement, local economic development, and funding for local projects. Without economic development within rural economies, we conclude that farmers will remain dependent upon continued subsidy assistance to meet the policy's ambitious environmental restrictions, thereby undermining the program's long-term sustainability.

They are already vulnerable to these multiple stressors, and the impacts of climate change are likely to further exacerbate their vulnerabilities. Some of these impacts may be observed and experienced already. The analysis presented in this paper is based on mixed methods empirical research exploring local perceptions of recent changes at four sites in coastal Tanzania and Mozambique. People recognise and rank a number of climate and non-climate stressors which have contributed towards more risky and less diverse livelihoods. Importantly, regional and international policy initiatives - in the form of river basin management in Mozambique and South Africa, and development of a Marine Protected Area in Tanzania - are perceived to further erode resilience and exacerbate vulnerabilities. We suggest this is a form of policy misfit, where policies developed to address a specific issue do not take account of cross-scale dynamics of change, the interactions between multiple stressors, nor longer term climate change. This policy misfit may be remedied by a move towards adaptive forms of governance, and necessitates an explicit focus on building the adaptive capacity of the poor and most vulnerable in society.

The Cooum is an extremely polluted urban stream. Its management is complicated by high rates of population growth, poverty, uncontrolled urban development, jurisdictional conflicts, institutional culture, flat topography, tidal action, blockage of the river mouth, and monsoon flooding. The situation is characterized by basic uncertainty about main processes and activities, and the nature of relationships among actors and elements in the system. SSM is an approach for dealing with messy or ill-structured problematic situations involving human activity. In this work SSM contributed techniques (such as \"rich picture\" and \"CAT-WOE\" tools) to description of the Cooum situation as a socio-ecological system and informed the approach itself at a theoretical level. Application of three general phases in SSM is discussed in the context of the Cooum River research: (1) problem definition and exploration of the problem situation, (2) development of conceptual models of relevant systems, and (3) the use of these to generate insight and stimulate debate about desirable and feasible change. Its use here gives weightyto the statement by others that SSM would be a particularly appropriate methodology to operate the ecosystem approach. As well as informing efforts at management of the Cooum system, this work led the way to explore an adaptive ecosystem approach more broadly to management of the urban environment for human health in Chennai.","journal":"Environmental Management","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Because local land use has important impacts on alpine conditions and communities have significant capacity to manage alpine resources, we emphasized local collaboration during the initial stages of conservation planning. Our collaboration with local communities investigated how livelihood strategies affect the condition of alpine resources in northwestern Yunnan and how future conservation efforts can be compatible with local livelihoods. We sampled three livestock herding sites, each within a different alpine sub-region, using open-ended interviews and maximum variation sampling. According to interviewees, livestock grazing within the alpine zone currently does not appear to be negatively impacting the availability of forage. Medicinal plant collection, however, is showing unsustainable trends. Tourism is as yet a nascent industry, but is seen as having great potential by those interviewed. It is clear that with increases in population, access to regional markets, and tourism, northwestern Yunnan's rich alpine resources will require careful management. In addition to the data collected, we found that the methodology used may be widely applicable to organizations with limited resources that wish to engage local communities during the formative stages of regional-level conservation planning.

Recent processes of political decentralization and local autonomy offer chances for more rural participation and a stronger involvement of local communities in natural resource control. However, processes of effective empowerment and rule creation at the local level are impeded by a series of intervening factors. Thus, the division of authority and responsibility among different village institutions is not conclusively regulated in the state regulations. The devolution of rights related to local resource management remains mainly confined to so-called customary law communities, leaving no chances for communities which lack the necessary, state-defined indicators. In contrast to the laws on regional autonomy, the Forestry Law and other sectoral laws are only weakly dedicated to decentralization. Indonesian policy lacks both, an integrated vision and an integrated legal framework for the management of protected areas. Instead, the sectoral character of the Indonesian law does neither support the establishment of a co-ordinated management plan for the resources surrounding the villages, nor does it offer meaningful guidance for community empowerment. Laws and regulations regulating NRM in direct manners offer often less opportunity for local communities to manage their resources autonomously compared with legal devices regulating resource use in indirect manners. The room of manoeuvre of the forest margin communities in the Lore Lindu region is further limited by their buffer zone position in regard to the zoning scheme of the National Park.","journal":"Journal of Agriculture and Rural Development in the Tropics and Subtropics","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

This has been hindered by the elusive nature of many carnivores, as well as a disproportionate focus on large-bodied species and particular geographic regions. We use multiple survey methods and a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model accounting for imperfect detection to assess extinction risk across the entire carnivore community in Ghana's Mole National Park, a poorly studied West African savanna ecosystem. Only 9 of 16 historically occurring carnivore species were detected in a camera-trap survey covering 253 stations deployed for 5469 trap days between October 2006 and January 2009, and our occupancy model indicated low overall likelihoods of false absence despite low per-survey probabilities of detection. Concurrent sign, call-in, and village surveys, as well as long-term law enforcement patrol records, provided more equivocal evidence of carnivore occurrence but supported the conclusion that many carnivores have declined and are likely functionally or fully extirpated from the park, including the top predator, lion (Panthera leo). Contrary to expectation, variation in carnivore persistence was not explained by ecological or life-history traits such as body size, home range size or fecundity, thus raising questions about the predictability of carnivore community disassembly. Our results imply an urgent need for new initiatives to better protect and restore West Africa's embattled carnivore populations, and they highlight a broader need for more empirical study of the response of entire carnivore communities to anthropogenic impact.

Only when the first donor left in 1999, owing to Zimbabwe becoming an international pariah, was there space for another donor to reconceptualise the same buzzwords on different premises, leading to more positive outcomes.

In order to protect forest resources from such overexploitation, collaborative forest management approach has been adopted by the National Forestry Authority with emphasis on local community involvement. This study examined the level of net economic benefit received from forest produce and it to investigate whether there was a positive effect in poverty reduction. The study further attempted to examine the effects of poverty on the environmental integrity through CFM progrmme in two parishes of Ulukusi and Mutshet, surrounding Mt. Elgon National Park. Using non-parametric statistics, the local community livelihood index was examined on a sample size of 120 respondents. A Cost-Benefit Analysis was applied to estimate the distribution impact and poverty reduction impact. The findings of this study revealed that there was a significant change in livelihood as well as forest conservation status. The income distribution impact analysis showed that the poor people benefited substantially from the collaborative forest management program. The Poverty Index Ratio (0.95) suggest a positive indication of poverty reduction impact. It was found that the involvement of rural poor could be a process of poverty-environment interaction. The collaborative forest management approach is useful to increase the interaction between rural poor and resource management towards environmental sustainability.

A majority of the people of Bangladesh are critically dependent on wetlands. In this paper, the values of wetlands, causes and effects of wetlands degradation, as well as the present wetlands management approach, are analyzed and recommendations for wetlands management are suggested based on participatory rural appraisal (PRA), field visit, personal experience, and existing literature and information. Wetlands play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of ecosystems, but wetlands habitat of Bangladesh is under constant threat due to increase of population, intensive agriculture, overfishing, siltation, pollution, ill-planned infrastructures, lack of institutional coordination, lack of awareness, etc. As a result biodiversity is reducing, many species of flora and fauna are threatened, wetlands-based ecosystem is degenerating, and the living conditions of local people are deteriorating as livelihoods, socioeconomic institutions, and cultural values are affected. Wetlands management is not addressed separately in water management activities of Bangladesh. In order to balance human needs and wetlands conservation, a mainly community-based wetlands management approach has been taken in Bangladesh, but this is not enough to prevent the degradation of wetlands. Therefore, Bangladesh now needs a comprehensive strategy combining political, economic, social, and technological approaches to stop further degradation of wetlands. Therefore, wetlands management should be incorporated into a system of integrated land and water use and, indeed, into the socioeconomic system of the country. Policies, strategies, and management plans for sustainable use and conservation of wetlands of Bangladesh must be based on solid knowledge and understanding of their ecological and socioeconomic functions and processes.

Their importance has increased with time owing to globalisation, as the spread of invasive species is facilitated by the increased movement of people, cargo and genetic material around the world. There is a vast literature on the economics of invasive species and their management. Here, we contribute to this literature by applying a spatio-temporal model to the allocation of surveillance resources. We focus on three questions regarding resource allocation to control a newly discovered invasion: the budget, which determines the amount of search effort available; the duration of the control program; and the allocation of surveillance and control in time and space. We also explore the complementary role of passive surveillance by members of the public. We derive efficient frontiers for effort allocation that represent the trade-off between cost and probability of eradication after inefficient strategies have been eliminated. We use the results to illustrate how to evaluate whether introduction of passive surveillance is desirable based on cost and eradication probability. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings in the design of control programs. Â© 2011 The Authors.

A checklist is provided incorporating some 30 qualitative or semi-quantitative criteria to be completed by resource experts as a preliminary basis for deciding on priorities for precautionary management of marine resources or fisheries. Four tables are provided (incorporating characteristics respectively, of landing trends, environment and ecosystem, the stocks, and the fishery). The scoring of this checklist permits a semi-quantitative comparison between fisheries in terms of their relative vulnerabilities to non-precautionary harvesting, and allows qualitative but informed opinions to play a part. This approach may also be used in determining which aspects of the fishery require particular attention from research and management, including, if necessary, the formulation of appropriate Limit Reference Points. It is proposed that multiple precautionary reference points be used which are relatively simply formulated and understood by stakeholders. These would need to be built into a management system incorporating pre-negotiated responses. Analogous to fuzzy logic principles, a methodology is proposed whereby a suite of simple limit reference points can be tuned to provide a gradated management response to the status of multiple precautionary criteria or indices, possibly including the results of questionnaires described in this paper. In this approach the fisheries management cycle incorporates a resource 'traffic light' in the public domain which indicates the state of the fishery, and incorporates a prenegotiated set of management actions in response to the number of red lights on a multiple Limit Reference Point board. The management action should increase in severity depending on the number of indicators that turn from green to red.","journal":"NAFO Scientific Council Studies","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This contrastive study of 200 households in two eco-marketing zones in Myanmar (accessible Central Myanmar vs. isolated Rakhine State) uses regression analysis to test three hypotheses derived from the previous literature to explain behavioral intentions and positive/negative environmental behavior. All three hypotheses were rejected, suggesting strong country specificity in selecting optimal behavior-based policies for forest conservation and non-destruction. Policy orientations were formulated to help reverse environmental degradation, promote community-oriented activities toward positive environmental behaviors, and provide sustainable pathways out of poverty for rural households. The main problem in Central Myanmar emerges as one of motivation, which could be promoted by public awareness programs, outside employment and financial viability. In Rakhine State, where the environmental footprint is heavier, policies should empower conservation by providing both technologies and the feeling of self-efficacy, particularly on the part of older people operating non-specialized farms close to the road. In the absence of pro-active government, these results can help bring the voice of rural Myanmar villagers to world attention.

L.","year":2012,"title":"Traditional forest conservation knowledge/technologies in the Cordillera, Northern Philippines","dAbstract":"In the Philippines, indigenous knowledge has been recognized to contribute to sustainability of production systems, having been validated for their technical and scientific soundness by many investigators. It was in 1992 that the Philippine government gave recognition to the potentials of indigenous knowledge systems following the Earth Summit in 1992. Prior to this, scientists/researchers, development workers and lawmakers in the Philippines were preoccupied with their craft seeking \"modern\" ways of doing and accomplishing things. Cordillera in the Northern Philippines is a host to many indigenous cultures like Isneg, Kalinga, Bontok, Kankanaey, Tingguian, Gaddang, Ayangan and Tuwali, Kalanguya or Ikalahan, Ibaloy and Karao whose traditional knowledge systems were subject of many studies and investigations.The paper describes the different knowledge systems for natural resources management in the Cordillera as practiced by the people with different beliefs, culture and traditions. The paper showcases different resource conserving experiences in these cultures like muyong and ala-a systems of the Ifugaos; lapat among the Isneg and Tingguians; inum-an, gen-gen, day-og, balkah, kinebbah, tuping and pamettey of the Ikalahans. These knowledge systems have been practiced by the indigenous peoples in the Cordillera and have been transmitted from generation to generation, making their way of life in harmony with their physical and social surroundings. While culture is environment specific, adoption/transfer of some indigenous technologies that may be fitting to other cultures and communities, with a little modification to suit their needs, can be done.

In this context, strategies have recently been developed to maintain these coastal wetlands in a sustainable way, however, wetlands are under pressure, particularly due to land use changes, because they have traditionally been treated as areas of low economic value or even as risky areas for human health. As a result, wetlands have suffered some loss and substantial habitat alteration, which are associated with high social costs. Thus, inventories are required to identify these environments and define and value their services to obtain appropriate information relevant to conservation strategies. This research introduces a spatial component for classifying wetland types and further evaluation of their ecosystem services (ES), assessing their current distribution and extent using standardized remote sensing techniques for wetland mapping. A value transfer approach was performed to generate baseline estimates of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands, validating it through a meta-analysis of a database of wetland estimates, with northwest Mexico wetlands as case study. We found that saltmarshes were the most important wetland in terms of covered area and also that socio-economic variables, such as income, are important in explaining wetland values. The results show that in 2003, a value of 1 billion USD per year was delivered to the local citizens by the surrounding wetlands provided as services and benefits. In a spatially explicit manner, this approach highlights the contribution made by wetlands to the well-being of communities. We argue that in the future design of management plans, the conservation of these environments should be a priority, regarding both, ecologically and economically views. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A.","year":2009,"title":"Community involvement in management for maintaining coral reef resilience and biodiversity in southern Caribbean marine protected areas","dAbstract":"Climate change is posing new challenges to conservation because management policies on protected coral reefs are less effective than they were before the current ecosystem degradation. Coral reefs, the most diverse and complex marine ecosystem provide economic services for millions, but are seriously threatened worldwide because reef-building corals are experiencing bleaching phenomena and a steady decline in abundance. The resources of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Cartagena, Colombia, are in constant decline, despite a current management plan and on-site staff, urging new conservation actions. A multidisciplinary team gathered to evaluate management effectiveness including biophysical, socioeconomic and governance indicators. Coral cover and fish diversity and abundance were low both inside and outside the MPA, which suggests a limited efficiency of management. Currently, the MPA is a reef with low coral cover and high algae cover as well as large dead coral areas, which are generally signs of highly degraded reef habitats. Live coral cover in the MPA was represented by pioneer coral species such as Agaricia tenuifolia and Porites astreoides. Nonetheless, 35% of the scleractinian species sampled in the area harbored more than one zooxanthellae symbiont, which suggests potential resistance and resilience against coral bleaching. Maintenance of trophic structure and functional diversity is an important endeavor that should be a priority for management in order to allow ecosystem resilience. Social and governance indicators showed low-income levels and few opportunities for communities living in and around the park, low governability, weak communication among stakeholders and with authorities at different levels. As a result, problems related to over exploitation of resources were commonplace in the MPA. These results reflect low adaptive capacity of communities to comply with restrictive conservation rules, showing that establishment of a protected area is a necessary but insufficient condition to guarantee conservation goals. Ignoring the role of local communities only will exacerbate the problems associated with natural resources. Involvement of communities in strategic ecosystems management appears to be a requisite to improve effectiveness of protected areas, and participatory strategies, such as co-management, offer opportunities to improve governability while letting communities adapt to MPA needs.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

We constructed a use value index (UV) combining the use frequency (U) and the quality perception (Q) of useful plant species by local people. We identified all plant species used by the Raramuri and classified them into 14 general use categories. We interviewed 34 households in the village to compare men and women's knowledge on the five main general use categories (and on their respective subcategories and specific uses), to document how they practice gathering activities and to calculate scores of plants UV. A total of 226 useful plant species were identified, but only 12% of them had high UV scores for the 42 specific uses defined. When the overall knowledge of plant species was examined, no significant differences were detected between men and women, but significant differences were identified in general use categories such as medicinal plants, plants for construction and domestic goods, but not in plants used as food and firewood. We identified a division of labor in gathering activities associated with gender, with women mainly gathering medicinal and edible plants and being involved in preparing medicines and food, whereas men were primarily gathering and using plants for manufacturing domestic goods, firewood, and building materials. Plant species UV associated to gender were significantly different between men and women at the level of specific uses in the general category of domestic goods and building. Frequency of use is highly associated with plant species quality perception.","journal":"Human Ecology","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

P.","year":2007,"title":"A species approach to marine ecosystem conservation","dAbstract":"1. The concept of integrated ecosystem conservation is widely supported as a framework to achieve sustainable management of biodiversity. However, paucity of data and limited methodological tools reduce its application in approaches that integrate scientific knowledge, enhance international cooperation, and promote a rationale that appeals to stakeholders. 2. The landscape species concept (LS), a species-based conservation planning tool developed for patterns and processes of terrestrial conservation, is applied to the Extended Patagonian Marine Ecosystem (E-PME) in the SW Atlantic. The E-PME encompasses the Patagonian continental shelf, shelf break front and part of the Argentine Basin (ca. 3 000 000 km 2). 3. This ecosystem is influenced by oceanographic patterns of currents and bathymetry as well as by the overlapping geographies of national and international conventions, including those that govern use of the High Seas. The interactions of these oceanographic and jurisdictional structures, and the distribution and seasonal movements of biological species, drive present conservation opportunities and threats. 4. Here, an analysis of 33 candidate species in terms of their area requirements, heterogeneity of their habitat use, vulnerability to threats, ecological functions, and socioeconomic importance is reported, and a suite of 'seascape species' is developed around which to build conservation efforts. Preliminary geographic representations of the human and biological aspects of the seascape are provided, and how their spatial intersection affects conservation approaches is discussed. 5. The application of a focal species approach in an ecosystem framework complements space-habitat perspectives (e.g. the Large Marine Ecosystem concept) and may lead to more efficient planning of marine protected areas.

In the post-2012 period, developing countries could receive financial benefits in return for decreasing their greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Protected areas can act as a case study for REDD: lessons can be learnt from their success or otherwise in reducing deforestation and supporting local livelihoods. Depending upon the exact mechanisms decided between and within countries, protected areas could have a role to play in reducing national-scale deforestation, through strengthening existing forest protected areas and/or declaring new areas. Overall, protected areas are effective at limiting deforestation, but there are exceptions. Their track record in supporting livelihoods is more variable. The early indications are that community-managed and indigenous reserves are often effective in achieving both goals, but that biodiversity conservation is not necessarily such a high priority within these areas. Further research into the most effective management and governance frameworks for achieving goals on carbon emissions, biodiversity and communities, and the extent to which protected areas reduce (or merely displace) deforestation within national boundaries would be useful in informing REDD implementation.","journal":"Biodiversity","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Conservation and the consumptive use of marine turtle eggs at Ostional, Costa Rica","dAbstract":"'Sustainable use' of wildlife resources and 'community based conservation' are two themes recurrent in contemporary statements of wildlife conservation policy, and their use is in response to a perceived 'deep conservation crisis' which has in part arisen from exclusionary and restrictive conservation practices. The extent to which the legal harvest of marine turtle eggs in Ostional, Costa Rica, is an example of sustainable use and community based conservation is evaluated in this paper. Field research using in-depth interviewing and a household questionnaire was undertaken in Ostional during 1994 and 1995, to investigate local perceptions of the egg harvesting project, both positive and negative. Socio-economic benefits from, and legal and administrative structures supporting, the project were found to be fundamental to community support for a limited egg harvest and allowed for community participation in, and control of, resource use. Participation and control were key to local support for conservation of nesting marine turtles and their eggs. Attempts to use wildlife sustainably must be considered on a case by case basis, to account for the biological nature of the wildlife resource and environment in question and for local socio-economic, political and historical conditions. Nevertheless, some of the lessons learned from the attempt to implement sustainable use and community based conservation in Ostional may be more widely generalized, and may help inform other efforts to reconcile wildlife conservation objectives with local development needs.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Legal and administrative structures ensured community participation in and control of resource use, and evidence indicated support for community-based conservation (CBC) was high. In 2004, the study was repeated to assess how perceptions of the egg harvest might have changed over time. There were continued high levels of support for conservation and positive perceptions of the project's impacts on the economy, environment and community. Some explanations for impact rankings have changed, with greater emphasis on the importance of conservation and awareness of how this is achieved, greater animosity towards one government agency and greater concern about the impacts of tourism on the egg harvesting project. Between surveys, a variety of social, political and economic changes have occurred. The CBC concept has been further refined and critiqued; by examining a CBC project over time, this paper considers the durability and flexibility of the incentive, legal and administrative structures associated with a successful example of CBC.

It is important because it involves highly threatened species that can cause significant economic damage and be killed in retribution. Yet, to date, no quantitative study has sought to test possible solutions for preventing this form of human-wildlife conflict. 2.From February 2007 to August 2009, we monitored crop-raiding patterns across a Sumatran agroforest landscape to determine background levels of human-orangutan conflict. We also intensively monitored a subset of 50 farms to assess changes in farmer attitudes towards orangutan management; differences between farmer reported and independently enumerated monetary loss from crop raiding; and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques in reducing orangutan crop raiding on 35 treatment farms (25 trialling noise deterrents and 10 trialling tree nets) in comparison with 15 control farms over a pre-trial (12month) and a trial (18month) phase. Five months after the trials had ended, the ongoing use or uptake of the techniques were assessed. 3.Across the wider landscape, background levels of mean daily orangutan crop-raiding incidents per month (Â±SE) farms did not significantly differ between the pre-trial (9Â·1Â±3Â·7) and trial (7Â·1Â±4Â·3) phases, whilst on the 35 treatment farms it reduced significantly. Furthermore, crop yield increased (+60Â·8%) on the netted trial trees, but reduced (-27Â·4%) on the control farm trees. Despite this, there was no subsequent use of this technique, unlike those farmers (40%) who continued using the less-effective noise deterrents. 4.Farmer participation in the project yielded unexpected and positive attitude changes, from preferring orangutan removal (pre-trial) to in situ management with crop protection measures (post-trial). However, project participation may have increased farmer expectations of receiving compensation because the treatment farmers consistently overestimated their crop losses, unlike the control farmers who did not. 5.Synthesis and applications. Whilst human-orangutan conflicts caused substantial losses to local livelihoods, the identification of an effective mitigation method (nets) neither guaranteed its continued use nor uptake. Developing easy to install nets for valuable tree crops is therefore recommended. Nevertheless, the project intervention efforts did create benign farmer attitudes towards orangutan management, an essential prerequisite for managing large-bodied mammals in conflict with people.

To consider this problem, we investigated the implications of China's national and regional policies related to the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) for poverty in the dryland regions of northern Shaanxi Province. We found that 34.9, 47.0, and 59.8% of farmers, livestock grazers, and forest workers respectively, felt that their livelihoods had been adversely affected by the NFCP due to the ban on logging and grazing imposed by this program, and they perceived additional economic losses because they were not adequately compensated for their economic losses under the program. These perceptions are supported by economic data. In addition, our results showed that the poorer the survey respondent, the greater the likelihood they believed that they had suffered from the implementation of the NFCP. Although Chinese citizens have become more favorable towards environmental conservation efforts, the poorest citizens still need considerable help to make it possible for them to participate in both economic development and environmental restoration.

Most fanners appreciated the compensation policy of GGP, but a few of them (8.9% and 2.2% , respectively) considered the planting of trees and of forage species to be a priority. Although only 19.1% of the farmers felt that their livelihoods were adversely affected by the GGP and 63.8% of the farmers supported the project, a large proportion (37.2%) still planned to return to cultivating forested areas and grassland, once the project was over. Therefore, the vegetations restored by the Project were at the risk of being converted once more into farmland and rangeland when the Project' s subsidies ended, compromising the sustainability of the Project' s environmental achievements. For the success of the programs about environmental restoration, the GGP should give rational compensation to the farmers for their costs, make technical progress to increase the output of per unit land, and create jobs and training programs to transfer the rural surplus labor.","journal":"Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Ecological, hydrogeological and geochemical factors affect the physical environment in which people live. The niche theory and Schroeder principle that reveal relationship between ecological effects and element contents have important implication on hydrogeochemical study in the respect of human health. The zones of hydrogeochemistry were studied in the term of ecological, physiological and epidemical effects on organisms based on the ecological rationales and element contents. In the hydrogeochemical zone lack of some elements due to the leaching and transferring, the biological and physiological effect is negatively correlated to the elements contents; whilst in the zone of element enrichment resulting from leaching and concentration, they are positively correlated to the element contents. The appropriate concentration for the organisms is ranged between these two zones. The relationships between environmental elements (e.g. Se, I and F) and endemic diseases, KBD, IDD and dental fluorosis/caries, were analysed in the Li-Liu area, Shanxi province, northern China. In this hydrogeochemical system, the prevalence and severity of these endemic diseases were caused by deficient or excessive contents of Se, I and F in water and soil.

They emphasized the difficulty of integrating conservation into a broad picture that accounts for public perception as well as scientific knowledge. We support this general call for better integration of society in conservation research, but we believe that the original framework might misguide conservation practices if wrongly interpreted. Our objective is to complement their paper and correct a few misleading points, by showing that (1) for regions of high endemicity \"reservation\" may be the best conservation practice, and does not prevent public participation, (2) aiming for broad societal agreement is valuable, but in some cases risky, and always complex, and (3) calling a harmful invasive species harmful shouldn't be an issue. The Australian context provides us with many cases of the labeling of exotic species as harmful or not, using inputs from scientists, industry, and the public. Integration of social and scientific points of view can only improve conservation on the ground if it allows managers to use the ecological, economic and social impacts of exotic species to prioritize conservation actions in an operative way.

To develop a feasible yet rigorous strategy for learning from these REDD+ pilots, it is critical to assess previous efforts to evaluate the impacts of 'pre-REDD+' avoided deforestation projects. Further, because REDD+ remains a politically volatile issue, with both critics and supporters pointing to the impacts (or lack thereof) of these pre-REDD+ projects, it is important to critically examine the methods employed to assess those impacts. We review the body of literature that makes claims about the socioeconomic and biophysical impacts of pre-REDD+ projects. We find assessments of outcomes or impacts for only five pre-REDD projects. The design, data collection, and analysis methods for understanding the impacts of pre-REDD+ projects frequently lack rigor. In particular, the counterfactual scenarios for establishing socioeconomic impacts are vague, unscientific, or omitted completely. We conclude that drawing specific lessons from pre-REDD+ projects for the design or evaluation of current REDD+ projects is tenuous. Rigorous project evaluations are challenging, expensive, and time-consuming, but because they are so critical for learning about what works for people and forests, evaluations of current REDD+ projects must use improved methods. In particular, much better care should be taken to construct credible - and where possible, consistent - counterfactuals for both biophysical and socioeconomic outcomes.

Semistructured interviews were conducted in 2006 and 2007 with leaders (N = 16) and household heads (N = 102) of smallholder communities in the reserve and its buffer zone. Complementary qualitative and quantitative analyses of interview data reveal that household head attitude towards the reserve is primarily associated with loss or gain of resource use rights: there is a significant difference in attitude between the household heads interviewed in the reserve and those in the buffer zone. Communities in the region used to share certain lands and floodplains, especially for the extraction of fish, poletimber, and thatch palm. With the reserve's establishment, only those who lived within the reserve were allowed to continue using previously shared resources, while the access of neighboring communities, now in the buffer zone, was banned from most of the reserve. A linear predictive model reveals that attitude towards the reserve also relates to location and household demographic variables, hypothesized to influence the household's capacity to respond to losses in income sources and subsistence means. Comparisons of leaders' and residents' responses suggest that although involuntary economic displacement has affected many locals, government authorities have not addressed the issue satisfactorily, at least from the perspective of those displaced, thus obscuring the conservation-related exclusion that occurred.

Now it is clear that integrating fishers in management processes is key to resource conservation, but it is less clear how to do it. Here, based on a literature review and new information, we present and analyze a case in which the participation of fishers in the management process was crucial in recovering an overexploited small-scale fishery for the pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) in the Amazon Basin, Brazil. In 8 years of experimental management, from 1999 to 2006, the population of pirarucu increased 9-fold (from about 2200 to 20,650 individuals), harvest quotas increased 10-fold (from 120 to 1249 individuals), and fishers' participation in the management process increased and they benefited from increased monetary returns. Additionally, the number of communities conducting the management scheme increased from 4 in 1999 to 108 in 2006, following the demands of fishers and regional government agencies. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the participation of fishers in the management of other small-scale fisheries in the world can be improved by focusing on (1) applying the knowledge and skills of fishers in resource monitoring and management, (2) bridging knowledge systems among all involved stakeholders, (3) collaborating with fishers that are interested in, and capable of conducting, resource conservation schemes, and (4) conducting management under conditions of uncertainty.

However, experience shows that co-management regimes can set into motion new conflicts or cause old ones to escalate. In practice the result may not be power sharing but rather a strengthening of the state's control over resource policy, management, and allocation. Instead of contributing to local empowerment, such arrangements may further marginalize communities and resource users. We use case material, primarily from northern Canada and South Asia, to explore the pervasive role of conflict in generating, shaping, and influencing the performance of co-management regimes. The paper analyzes the divergent interests and motives of state agencies in planning and implementing co-management arrangements. It highlights the cultural, political, and legal obstacles encountered by indigenous people and other rural communities in trying to negotiate co-management arrangements. We also explore the conflicts that can arise in co-management regimes where local participation in decision making is very limited. General lessons and recommendations are drawn from our analysis.

{"author":"Catsadorakis, G.; Malakou, M.","year":1997,"title":"Conservation and management issues of Prespa National Park","dAbstract":"The present article describes the human activities in the area and their changes and trends, given that the contemporary nature conservation key issues are closely related to past and present socio-economic and cultural conditions, both within Prespa itself and outside of it. The liberation of Prespa, a remote and rather socially isolated borderline area, from Ottoman occupation took place in 1912-13. Recent events in its environmental history have been forest clearings and human depopulation in the Civil War (1944-49), irrigation system construction in the 1960s, its 'discovery' by ornithologists in the late 1960s, the high emigration rates of 1960-1980, its designation as a National Park in 1974, the destructive development works of 1984-86 after Greece's entry to the EEC and the conversion to intensive bean cultivation in the mid 1980s. The human population of ca 7000 at the start of this century suffered an almost 80% decrease after the Civil War. A resettlement in the mid 1950s increased the population by 40% but in the 1970s emigration reduced it to its previous size of around 1500, still its present size. The extensive and diverse farming systems of previous centuries changed gradually after the construction of an irrigation network in the 1960s, which twenty years later and along with international changes in production and economy patterns, made possible the present day domination of a bean monoculture within irrigated croplands. This was accompanied by increased energy inputs, mechanisation and the use of chemicals. Intensification of agriculture brought increased incomes which attracted also livestock keepers, resulting in a 56% decrease in numbers of livestock in 1964-1993. Cattle are presently kept for meat production only. They graze on the mountains, and no longer in the meadows around the lakeshore. A local shorthorn breed accounting for 93% of all cattle in 1963 declined to less than 18% in 1993. Fishing aimed mainly at carp and Prespa bleak, continues today as in the past to be a source of supplementary income. Eighty-six per cent of the mainly oak and beech - forests are State owned and the rest belong to local municipalities. The forest area has not changed essentially in the last 40 years, but forest roads have expanded. Forests provide mainly fuelwood for local needs and small quantities of industrial timber. No specific management is conducted to safeguard the conservation values of the forest, the majority of which consists of even aged coppiced stands with limited value for wildlife. Manufacturing never played an important role for the economy of the area. Tourism has increased in the last 20 years, concentrated mainly in summer and spring. Accommodation in the villages is not yet satisfactory though it has improved enormously in recent years. The National Park's infrastructure for visitors remains poor. Tourist pressure generally is not yet that high to impact drastically the social and environmental fabric. In places, hunting, angling and poaching can negatively affect the target species. The construction of the irrigation network in the eastern part of Lake Mikri Prespa was the most important change to the landscape and the habitats of Prespa the last 30 years. It resulted in the embankment of free-flowing streams, drainage of wet meadows and dramatic reduction of trees and hedges. In the last 15 years, the reedbeds, no longer burnt or mowed and assisted by increased nutrient loadings from agricultural runoff, have expanded landward to occupy formerly open, periodically flooded, areas. The above changes in habitats and land use have brought an impoverishment of biodiversity which can be seen in the extermination or the decrease in the numbers of certain plant and bird species. The problems preventing a better management of the National Park and the perpetuation of its values are inappropriate legislation, the poor degree of coordination of the public services, the lack of both a specific National Park Service in Greece and a management authority for the Park and the hostile attitude of l cal people due to their limited information and involvement. The scenic beauty, the wetlands and a number of rare habitats, the diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, the endemic life forms, the rare mammals and the colonial waterbirds, the local architecture and the cultural expressions such as the Byzantine monuments, are the values of Prespa that must be preserved as a whole. The initial conservation efforts aimed at preserving biodiversity but later it became apparent that not only are humans an inseparable part of the whole, but additionally, several of their extensive activities have contributed substantially to the rich biodiversity of the area. Through the prerequisites of keeping a balance between primary and tertiary sector activities and of revitalizing the social fabric, the following are the key management and conservation issues of today: an unequivocal agreement on the values to be preserved and their limits; the formation of a management authority; a new realistic protection and land use zoning; the diversification and extensification of all farming activities; the restoration of the wet meadow habitats; the ensuring of a high water level and a good water quality for both lakes through tri-lateral cooperation between Greece, Albania and FYROM; and the establishment of a permanent environmental monitoring scheme.

The authors report empirical evidence from 12 case studies from six countries, which are analyzed through the conceptual lens of the Impoverishment Risks and Reconstruction Model for Involuntary Resettlement. The research concludes conservatively that parks in the Congo basin have already displaced and impoverished about 120-150 000 people and that more will be displaced if this approach continues, despite its deleterious outcomes. The authors argue that the park-establishment strategy predicated upon compulsory population displacement has exhausted its credibility and compromised the cause of biodiversity conservation by inflicting aggravated impoverishment on very large numbers of people. They recommend that the concerned Governments should desist using the eviction approach. The alternative course, proposed by the authors, is to replace forced displacements with a pro-poor strategy that pursues \"double sustainability,\" to protect both the biodiversity and people's livelihoods at the same time.

The AF had the main objectives to provide a consistent contribution to the State budget and to improve rural livelihoods through an equitable and effective redistribution of forest-related benefits. After a decade of implementation, and about 85 million redistributed to about 50 councils, the literature unanimously evaluates the livelihood impacts of the distribution of the AF to communities as weak. Less comprehensive assessments have been carried out on the impacts of distribution of the AF to local governments. This paper discusses the potential of the AF as a tool for local development through local councils, with particular attention to the economic, equity and governance issues. One of the most significant findings is that mayors, although elected and unanimously blamed for embezzlements and mismanagement of the AF, are often only scapegoats in a complex political system that does not allow the rural population to directly sanction the misuse of the AF via the current electoral system.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The conceptual framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) was adapted to this study to examine the impact of the drivers of change on TK and components Of human well-being, changes in TK and components of human well-being, and interrelations amongst them. Relevant data were collected through conducting in-depth interviews and administering a survey. The results of the survey revealed that 46 wild edible plants, 12 seaweeds, and 19 mushroom species are widely collected for a variety of purposes in the selected sites. Unfortunately, it was determined that the current trend in the study sites is increasing erosion of traditional knowledge and relevant traditional practices due to the impacts of the drivers addressed in this stud), (e.g. ageing and migration). Assessment of the linkages between TK and human well-being shows that both the decline in TK and the drivers of change adversely, affect five fundamental components of human well-being (e.g. health, development of good social relations, and security). Recognizing this undesirable trend, a holistic strategy was developed to sustain, use, and transmit TK as a living cultural resource in society. Within this context, a number of potential responses (e.g. economic, tourism-related, social and behavioural) and instruments (e.g. Community Development Fund) for providing benefit sharing among the target groups were developed to achieve success in the effective maintenance and promotion of TK and also to contribute to sustainable development strategies in the Peninsula.","journal":"Human Ecology Review","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

The method of the study included a series of stages such as fieldwork and interviews. Assessment of the data shows that a sustainable livelihood strategy is needed for bringing a positive synergy in terms of the sustainable use of MAPs in the national park, as MAPs as natural capital have led to the emergence of human, social and financial capitals to lift local livelihoods out of poverty. Finally, a number of recommendations for improving the sustainability of MAPs and local livelihoods in the park are discussed.

However, we observe a total absence of the recognition of the value of living nature and of nature as an environment of culture and human existence. It is predominantly guided by the philosophy of utilitarian development. It is not only observed in the developed world, but also in less developed world, including countries like India, policy formulation to arrest environmental degradation has failed to address the livelihood issues of marginal communities like pastoralists located in the high altitude of Western and Eastern Himalayas. As a result the term 'sustainable development' has become a misnomer, at least for those highland pastoralists. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the transhumance activity (known as gothwala system) as a means of livelihood which is in existence in the mountain settlement in Lachung valley, located in the east Himalayan State of Sikkim, India and the role played by traditional local body of governance, the 'Dzumsa' towards managing the natural resources, especially forest and fodder, in a sustainable manner. It also shows a process of natural resource management which is not based on modern scientific knowledge but age old traditional knowledge of indigenous tribes. To a large extent, it works in conformity with the true essence of the definition of sustainable development which cautioned us that in the long run, human and natural systems can not economically be viable unless they are also ecologically sound and socially responsible. However, to protect the forest from extraction of firewood, save the medicinal plants from grazing of cattle, the Government of Sikkim has enacted a law to abolish the 'gothwala system' without providing any alternative livelihoods. In the next as well as in the concluding section, a critical evaluation has been made towards the conservation approach followed by formal institutions in the name of sustainable development and how a conflict has arisen between conservation and existing livelihood opportunities.","journal":"Book Section","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Educational institutes and communities are considered to be important for mechanisms to solve the problems. The production of I-san (Northeastern) folk songs to promote the conservation of natural resources and environment is an approach used to promote awareness toward the natural resources and environmental conservation of students and people in general. The purposes of this research were: to produce I-san folk songs and a training handbook; study the results of knowledge transfer about the environment of students through training classified by genders and years of study and investigate the satisfaction of villagers toward the knowledge transfer about the environment to promote knowledge, attitude and awareness about natural resources and environmental conservation through Pong Lang musical performance of students. The sample used in this research was 30 Mathayomsuksa 4-6 students of Srikaewprachasan School under the jurisdiction of Secondary Educational Service Area Office 28, Loengnoktha district, Yasothon province and 329 villagers in communities close to location of the school. The instruments used for data collection were: 13 I-san folk songs; a training handbook; a test of knowledge about natural resources and environmental conservation with 40 items, the difficulty between 0.20 and 0.80, the discrimination between 0.27 and 0.62 and the reliability for whole research of 0.87, a test of attitude toward the conservation of natural resources and environment with 20 items; a test of awareness concerning natural resources and environmental conservation with 70; 5-rating scale items, the discrimination between 0.20 and 0.91 and the reliability for whole paper of 0.98 and a questionnaire about the satisfaction of villagers toward the use I-san folk songs through Pong Lang performance of students to promote knowledge, attitude and awareness about the natural resources and environmental conservation. The statistics used for data analysis were mean, percentage, standard deviation, paired t-test and F-test (two-way MANCOVA). The research results revealed that the appropriateness of 13 I-san folk songs for the promotion of natural resources and environmental conservation of the people in Loengnoktha district, Yasothon province, evaluated by the experts was at the highest level. They were all consistent with the 4 years provincial development plan (2010-2013) of Yasothon province. The levels of knowledge, attitude and awareness about natural resources and environmental conservation of the students both in general and classified by genders and years of study were higher than those of before the training with statistical significance at the level of 0.05. However, there was no relationship between genders and years of study with knowledge, attitude and awareness about natural resources and environmental conservation. The satisfaction of the villagers toward I-san folk songs through I-san Pong Lang musical performance to promote knowledge, attitude and awareness about natural resources and environmental conservation of the students was generally at the highest level.

We illustrate this potential using the case of hornbill conservation in the Budo-Sungai Padi rainforests of southern Thailand, using 16-y hornbill reproduction data and 5-y household expenditures data reflecting local economic well-being. We show that severe windstorms cause both lower household expenditures and critical nest tree losses that directly constrain nesting capacity and so reduce the number of hornbill chicks recruited in the following breeding season. Forest residents' coping strategies further disturb hornbills and their forest habitats, compounding windstorms' adverse effects on hornbills' recruitment in the following year. The strong statistical relationship between wind speed and both hornbill nest tree losses and household expenditures opens up an opportunity to design wind-based index insurance contracts that could both enhance hornbill conservation and support disaster-affected households in the region. We demonstrate how such contracts could be written and operationalized and then use simulations to show the significant promise of unique insurance-based approaches to address weather-related risk that threatens both biodiversity and poor populations.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

{"author":"Charles, A.; De Young, C.","year":2008,"title":"Benefits and costs of implementing the ecosystem approach to fisheries","dAbstract":"The ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) has been advocated widely, on the basis of its potential to meet a variety of goals, notably ecosystem health, sustainable resource use and human well-being. However, choices arise in implementation of EAF management, and each choice will produce benefits and costs. Benefits may be in terms of greater protection for a threatened species, greater long-term stability in food supply for a local community, reduced wastage or many other possibilities. Costs could include the direct costs of implementation (e.g. increased management costs) as well as the indirect or induced costs resulting from how the EAF is implemented (e.g. reduced employment and revenues in the short term). This chapter emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive assessment of these benefits and costs arising in EAF implementation, in order to improve decision making. The chapter undertakes a preliminary exploration of approaches and issues involved in such an assessment, examining four major aspects: (i) requirements, components and tools of EAF implementation having likely benefit and cost impacts; (ii) distributional implications, i.e. to whom the benefits and costs accrue, among stakeholders, inter-temporally and across spatial or administrative scales; (iii) compilation of potential EAF-related benefits and costs, grouped into ecological, economic, social and management categories; and (iv) the feasibility of various methodologies for assessing the benefits and costs of EAF implementation. The chapter also emphasizes the need for further research and analysis to develop the frameworks required for efficiently assessing the benefits and costs of EAF implementation in practical situations.

This review provides an overview of where the field of community forestry is today. We describe four case examples from the Americas: Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Bolivia. We also identify five hypotheses embedded in the concept of community forestry and examine the evidence supporting them. We conclude that community forestry holds promise as a viable approach to forest conservation and community development. Major gaps remain, however, between community forestry in theory and in practice. For example, devolution of forest management authority from states to communities has been partial and disappointing, and local control over forest management appears to have more ecological than socioeconomic benefits. We suggest ways that anthropologists can contribute to the field. Copyright Â© 2007 by Annual Reviews.

The photos were taken and presented to respondents in a defined and systematic way. The photo-based assessments gave no statistically significant difference (P<0.05) in terms of the evaluated average visual quality among the panels. This suggested that the proposed approach for systematic simulation assessment allowed for only expected random variation to be measured, thus the panel was not a source of variability. Salient and non-salient features were captured as reflected by significant differences (P<0.05) in different scenes, There was strong indication that the respondents had different expectations of what a functional urban green space should be in terms of auditory, tactile, olfactory and visual quality, and general recreational needs.

In the 2000s, Taiwan's government initiated a remodeling of the fishery right system, which is a rights-based approach to fisheries management, as an attempt to address conflicts between fishers and developers regarding the use of coastal space and to put community-based co-management into practice. The paper particularly compares the system before and after 2000 and identifies areas of concern in the implementation of the remodeled system. The results show that the government's support for this system signifies progress in the right direction. However, concerns emerge, mostly involving fishers' low participation, fishermen's association's lack of technical skills and financial resources, and the division of management responsibility. The government is advised to play a more active role in dealing with these concerns. Finally, the paper reveals that the factor of competition for using coastal zones poses a challenge to co-management, and suggests a holistic view with integrated coastal management or marine spatial planning practices, for developing co-management under the fishery right system.

Biological investigations included artificially inducing spawning in the laboratory and field, rearing of juveniles, monitoring of habitat characteristics, and establishing a protected area. The grain size of the sediment of the spawning ground was 0.4-1.8mm in diameter and that of the juvenile nursing ground was 0.11-0.19mm. The most suitable water temperature for incubating eggs and rearing juveniles ranged from 28 to 31Â°C. A total of 800ha of the coastal zone on Kinmen was designated a protected area for the horseshoe crab, based on the Fishery Law, in December 1999. Fishing is prohibited for the 5-year period from 2000 to 2004. Public education programs were conducted to help local people learn about the basic biology of the horseshoe crab, to become aware of its importance and the necessity for conservation, and to empower them to actively participate in the conservation of this species. In addition, a horseshoe crab conservation program has also been incorporated as an element of the local ecotourism industry.

This paper uses case studies and survey data in Gansu province of northwest China to explore social, ecological, and economic outcomes of community-based co-management (CBCM). Findings show that CBCM appears to have significantly increased livelihoods for local community residents overall. Forest condition and attitudes about forest conservation were also improved. However, economic benefits were not enjoyed uniformly within the communities because, although CBCM projects are nominally available to all, certain subgroups within communities are less likely to participate. Greater education, being married, and access to information are all strongly correlated with participation and thus the economic benefits of CBCM projects. Women, although they frequently participate in household decisions, are infrequent participants in CBCM projects, perhaps because project design does not meet their needs. Future improvements to CBCM project design should include increased access to information, education, and equitable treatment of diverse stakeholders in the decision-making process. Such improvements would likely lead to improvements in livelihoods as well as more sustainable forest management and conservation.","journal":"Regional Environmental Change","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

China introduced an insurance scheme to mitigate human-elephant conflict in Xishuangbanna Dai autonomous prefecture in Yunnan Province, where elephants cause damage to rubber plantations. However, recent experience has suggested that the present insurance system exhibits poor performance related to funding shortfalls, undervaluing of plantations and insufficient payouts, and by limiting community involvement. To address these shortcomings we conducted attitude surveys with farmers, and developed an actuarial (risk-based) insurance model for rubber loss that incorporated spatially-explicit risk of depredation and net present value of rubber at damage, in order to calculate fair payouts at village and town levels for the year 2011. Farmers were largely dissatisfied with the current insurance system, and their level of satisfaction was associated with the compensation ratio (percentage of lost rubber reimbursed by insurance). The illustrative results based on 2011 rubber loss data revealed high variability in risk and therefore payouts (and further, premiums) and that fair insurance payouts would be approximately five times the current levels. To improve compensation and support long-term program sustainability, we considered an insurance cost-sharing mechanism that incorporated shared payments from government, rubber farmers, and Chinese tourists. We found that multiple stakeholders were willing to pay for elephant conservation, which could make significant contributions to insurance premiums over the long term. Importantly, this proposed insurance model could be broadly applicable to livestock and long-lived cash crop compensation systems.

Historically, the Beibu Gulf supported various commercial, recreational, and artisanal fisheries. Many fisheries are now depleted or had experienced substantial declining. In this paper we developed a mass balance model using Ecopath with Ecosim for the Gulf of Beibu ecosystem in the Northern South China Sea. Input data were mainly from the information collected in trawl surveys during October 1998 to September 1999. Using the Ecosim model; we evaluated how the ecosystem may respond to change in fisheries over next 30 years. We considered four fishery management scenarios; which maximized three independent objective functions (fishery profits, employment, and ecosystem) and the combination of the above three objectives Big compromise) were simulated with different vulnerability settings. The results suggest that policy simulation aimed to maximize the economic will increasing all fishing effort of all fishing sector except demersal trawl should be reduced 43.2%; and social strategy were suggested increasing small-scale fishing effort to satisfy social benefits; especially for miscellaneous will increase 3. 48 times on current level; maximize ecological suggested all fishing sector should be reduced drastically or stop. Furthermore; policy simulations aimed to maximize the economic and social goal tend to be sensitive to vulnerability settings; whereas maximize ecologic stability and the compromise scenarios were generally consistent. The maximization of social and economical goals results in the complexity of ecosystem being decreased; high trophic levels species being depleted; and low trophic level species being increased. The maximization of the social strategy has the lowest trophic level 2. 78 of all the strategies considered in this study. A trade-offs analysis indicates that Big compromise, strategy would be optimal one which to balances fishery and resource conservation. These results indicate that developing multispecies harvesting strategies is a complex task and management goals focusing on different areas are likely to conflict each other.; and the initial model conditions can influence the results also.","journal":"Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Nevertheless, there has been only little research work on local residents' environmental attitude and their attitude towards nature conservation in destination to the present. This paper was aimed to determine what factors and how they influence local residents' attitude towards nature conservation in natural tourism destination. Taking China's Jiuzhaigou National Park and UK's New Forest National Park as cases, this paper made a comparative quantitative analysis of local residents' demographic features, environmental improvement expectation of tourism development, perception of tourism environmental impact, tourism environment ethics and the relations to their attitude towards nature conservation. Random sampling questionnaire survey was conducted respectively in local communities of the two case study areas in 2008 and 2009. After some statistic analyses of Chi-Square test, Spearman's rho Correlation, ANOVA and MANOVA with the software of SPSS16.0, this research came to some results as below: (1) As to local residents in natural tourism destination, their attitude towards nature conservation is effected by various factors with obvious difference between the UK and China; (2) demographic features of local residents have no impact on New Forest National Park's residents' attitude towards nature conservation; while gender and possibility of tourism participation do influence local residents' attitude towards nature conservation in Jiuzhaigou National Park: female residents (Chi -Square Ï‡2 =5. 720, P = 0. 017) and those who participated in tourism business (Chi -Square Ï‡2 =7. 365, P = 0. 007) are more likely to support nature conservation here; (3) As for residents in New Forest National Park, their attitude towards nature conservation is effected by their environment improvement expectation of tourism development (FNF = 2. 222, PNF =0. 071 &lt; 0. 10) and their tourism environment ethics rather than their perception of tourism environmental impact (FNF = 1. 240, PNF =0. 298). Residents who held stronger environmental improvement expectation of tourism development and who are environment protectionism in New Forest National Park are more likely to be nature conservation supporters (F^F - 5. 295, P - 0. 006); (4) With reference to local residents in Jiuzhaigou National Park, their environment improvement expectation of tourism development (FJZG =. 686, PJZG = 0. 563) and tourism environment ethics (FJZG = 0. 437, PJZG = 0. 648) have no impact on their attitude towards nature conservation, but their perception of tourism environmental impact does influence their attitude towards nature conservation (FJZG =3. 237, PJZG = 0. 017 &lt; 0. 10).

Buffer zone forests often act as the source of such resource needs with varying extraction frequencies. Observations on resources extraction patterns and use revealed the dependence of the inhabitants for their needs of fodder, fuelwood, timber and other NTFPs. Higher altitude settlements had higher dependency on the forest resources. The probability of use of fuel species such as Prunus cerasoides was maximum (0.88) and Resource Use index (RUI) was high for Leucosceptrum canum (670.6). The amounts of firewood used in winter were more with high collection frequency during morning sessions. Fuel species had many uses but space heating and preparation of drinks consumed maximum fuelwood. Similarly, the NTEPs were used for meeting the ethno cultural and therapeutic needs. Forest resource use to provide inputs to the subsistence farming was also observed. Ecological impacts vary from settlement to settlement but point to long-term impacts of such anthropogenic pressures. Resources contributed by forests and other sources were far more (>90% in case of fodder) than the production of farm-based resources. Open grazing by animals ranges from 62% to 80% with transhumance practices prevailing at higher altitudes. Some animals showed high bite rates and foraging periods, and could be regarded as threat to the existing ecosystem. The present status of resources has been interpreted by analysing the landuse/land cover by remote sensing methods. Judicious management of the fringe area settlements in terms of village socioeconomy, resource needs and enhanced on-farm based resource production may reduce such pressures. Further enhancement of local knowledge in conservation efforts could be the options for resolving future resource problems. Emphasis on better livelihood options of the local communities vis-Ã -vis legal protection of resources would help in minimizing such pressures in such a newly created protected area.

R.","year":2008,"title":"Trade-offs between conservation and socio-economic objectives in managing a tropical marine ecosystem","dAbstract":"Understanding the trade-off relationships between ecological, economic and social objectives is important in designing policies to manage or restore ecosystems. Using the northern South China Sea (NSCS) as a case study, we explore the trade-offs between conservation and socio-economic objectives in managing fisheries in tropical marine ecosystems. Using a numerical optimization routine and ecosystem modelling (Ecopath with Ecosim), the study shows that current management of the NSCS is sub-optimal both in terms of conservation and economic objectives. Therefore, improvement in both conservation status and economic benefits can be achieved by reducing fishing capacity. However, the implementation of conservation plans may be hindered by the reduced number of fisheries-related jobs and the lack of alternative livelihoods. Similar trade-offs are apparent in many tropical marine ecosystems. Thus, this paper supports claims from previous studies that solving the alternative livelihood problems appears to be a priority for improving management and conservation in these ecosystems. A buy-back scheme that is funded by fishers might be effective in reducing fishing capacity. However, public funds are required if management objectives focus strongly on conservation. This might be justified by the direct or indirect benefits to society that could be provided by well-conserved ecosystems. This study highlights the conflict between maximizing conservation and social objectives, although win-win solutions between conservation and economic objectives may be possible.

The results suggest that characteristics of wild species interact with economic factors to determine nuisance conditions. Households more proximate to the forest and with larger landholdings are more vulnerable to crop raiding while livestock loss is largely a result of illegal forest grazing. Species that have succeeded under the current conservation regime are the most frequent raiders and predators while declining species cannot and do not avail themselves of domesticated resources. These results suggest considering inter-specific park boundary encounters as part of a set of mutual ecological subsidies and flows rather than solely as conflicts.

These include the global public good of carbon sequestration and local and national level contributions to livelihoods for more than half a billion users. Forest commons are a particularly important class of forests generating these multiple benefits. Institutional arrangements to govern forest commons are believed to substantially influence carbon storage and livelihood contributions, especially when they incorporate local knowledge and decentralized decision making. However, hypothesized relationships between institutional factors and multiple benefits have never been tested on data from multiple countries. By using original data on 80 forest commons in 10 countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we show that larger forest size and greater rule-making autonomy at the local level are associated with high carbon storage and livelihood benefits; differences in ownership of forest commons are associated with trade-offs between livelihood benefits and carbon storage. We argue that local communities restrict their consumption of forest products when they own forest commons, thereby increasing carbon storage. In showing rule-making autonomy and ownership as distinct and important institutional influences on forest outcomes, our results are directly relevant to international climate change mitigation initiatives such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and avoided deforestation. Transfer of ownership over larger forest commons patches to local communities, coupled with payments for improved carbon storage can contribute to climate change mitigation without adversely affecting local livelihoods.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Implications of the associated local forest law enforcement on livelihoods, however, are not well understood. This paper explores the impacts of local forest law enforcement with a focus on the poorest forest users in community-managed forests. A case study including 14 community forest groups in western Nepal was conducted in 2008. Methods included review of archival data, a stakeholder survey (n = 211), and recall of forest crimes by a random household sample (n = 252). Local forest law enforcement was found to detect far more crimes than district-level enforcement. Crimes are primarily small-scale unauthorised appropriation of products for subsistence use by poorer households and rules are lightly enforced. It is argued that local law enforcement, while apparently not economically harmful to the poorer in the short term, may be used to perpetuate existing wealth and cast-based social inequities.

{"author":"Child, G.","year":1996,"title":"The role of community-based wild resource management in Zimbabwe","dAbstract":"Wildlife was in decline in Zimbabwe while the resource was being managed centrally by the State in terms of conventional protectionist legislation. The legislation was changed in 1960 and this led to cautious institutional reforms, whereby responsibility for wildlife was gradually devolved to landholders who were encouraged to use it profitably. This was achieved without the State abrogating its ultimate responsibility for the wellbeing of the resource. The CAMPFIRE programme was a response to the particular requirements of communally managed wild resources. Successful implementation required that appropriate institutions were in place. These allowed the peasants a meaningful say in the management of their wildlife and permitted them to use it profitably to generate a sufficient incentive to persuade them to conserve the resource on their land. As on large-scale commercial ranches, socio-economic factors proved more significant than ecological considerations in preserving wildlife on communally occupied land that is representative of much of Africa and the Third World.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

(PNC), beyond the protection and conservation of biodiversity and landscapes, focus on actions to promote awareness (i.e. territorial brand) and support for activities such as ecotourism. The scientific approaches, by various researchers (Chirita, 2003 [3], Matei 2005, Muntele, 2002 [9], Claval, 2003[5], Brunet, 1993 [2]), leverage methodological skills specific to environmental geography, sociology, tourism, ecoturism and economy and seek to identify opportunities for the articulation of different types of ecotourism as assessed and recommended in the Master Plan of the PNC [12], [13],with the mountain region as a geographical area protected by measures specific to environmental tourism. Characterised by the relative fragility, the mountain area of the CÇŽlimani is the largest sleeping-volcano of the Carpathian chain, spanning over more than 24,000 square hectares, with a National Park status since 2002, [13]. Tourism attraction and accessibility in the protected area, and certain actions focused on increasing tourist inflows have increased the vulnerability of the ecosystem and of the cultural landscape and their ecosystem sustainability, especially due to the proliferation of pseudo-ecotourism, aggressive tourism, that is less adapted to such protected areas. Our study identifies areas vulnerable to the impact of tourism and highlights the manner in which the administration of PNC and local communities articulate their efforts for sustainable development in villages surrounding the protected area, including by developing environmental tourism. This approach is not easy. The transformations in the economy due to the transition have impacted the function of the rural space, leading to strong (political, administrative, sociological) pressures in the communities adjacent to protected areas: the shift from mining activity, a key activity some of these areas, to logging and tourism activities was undertaken chaotically while quasi-incoherent strategies sought to develop tourism, in the management plans for the protected areas. As these pressures grow more intense, or are exacerbated, economic interests increasingly attracted (e.g. exploiting mineral resources), triggering increased vulnerabilities that demand the protection and conservation of landscapes. From this perspective, considering the features of relations in the Calimani Mountain National Park and the Dorna's Region area [4], we consider that the development of integrated management and master plans of protected areas, jointly with those of the administrative units to which they belong, would be a solution, and the identification of the elements of the complex cultural landscape of these regions can maintain and preserve the more traditional activities, with the specific community strengths and opportunities pointing to a viable SWOT. The study aims to identify the elements of vulnerable geographic areas, specific functional areas of the PNC, and articulate specific environmental tourism actions, to be included in the Master Plan for CÇŽlimani Mt. as protective measures as well as cultural dimensions of the protected space itself.

We facilitated farmers' meetings to create charts of local environmental and livelihood concerns and of their vision of the future. Water scarcity, bad road conditions, unemployment and low harvests emerged among the most prevalent concerns. Through a visioning process, participants arrived at a desired future that was largely inclined towards improved livelihoods, with comparatively little attention on biodiversity enhancement. We conclude that stakeholder-driven ecoagriculture could be a sustainable strategy to simultaneously achieve the community's vision and the goals of transfrontier conservation areas, provided biodiversity management strategies are linked to infrastructure improvement and income generating activities. We recommend a community visioning process as an effective approach to encourage collective action and to support local ownership of development programmes.

A number of aboriginal and tribal communities enrich the cultural heritage of the region. Thanchi upazilla (sub-district) of Bandarban district in the CHTs is the remotest forested area where some tribal groups still lead their subsistence life depending fully on natural resources. This exploratory study was conducted to document indigenous knowledge (IK) employed by the Mro tribe in their everyday activities, highlighting traditional utilization of forests and other natural resources. A total of 36 farms were assessed using different participatory appraisals through semi-structured questionnaire. The respondents were peasants who live on the hilltops in a pristine environment, inside the high ranges of hills and dense forest almost totally beyond the eye-sight of the outer civilized society. They developed IK of their own in practising shifting cultivation (Jhum) and other land use systems along with the utilization of natural resources. In most cases, such IK has become key factors in the sound management of their forest resources with sustainable utilization of biodiversity. But most of the wealth of their IK is being threatened by the settlement of the non-tribal people in the CHTs region. The life style and ethno-forestry perception regulated by IK governing the daily activities of the ethnic communities need to be explored in order to conserve them and to assess the possibilities for conserving the forest resources by utilizing such traditional indigenous concepts.

In this article, we focused on the latter, presenting the results of a community survey in and around Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, where collaborative management has been underway since 2004. A total of 302 members of the forest user groups (FUGs) were randomly selected and interviewed (23% of whom were female). Informants reported a satisfactory level of socio-economic development in the community since the initiation of the new management strategy. Two activities included in the collaborative management strategy- the provision of training for alternative income generating (AIG) activities and the allotment of available vacant lands for agriculture- significantly increased the community's annual income. Empowerment and improved social dignity of female participants was an additional outcome of the collaborative management approach. Community members also identified numerous shortcomings of the collaborative management project including failure to provide AIG training options that truly met the needs of the community, inequity in the distribution of training, and absence of pro-people manners of the local Co-management Committee toward community members. These shortcomings need to be addressed before the full potential of this, or any other participatory program of protected area management in Bangladesh can be realized.

Through a review of selected case-study-based island literature on changing livelihoods coming out of the South Pacific, we wish to illustrate and discuss advantages of finding common grounds for small island studies. The focus is on two dimensions of island livelihood, migration and natural resource management, both of which are significant contributors in making island livelihoods and shaping Pacific seascapes.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between dietary diversity and nutritional status of Orang Asli children in Krau Wildlife Reserve. Methods: A total of 216 children from three Orang Asli sub-tribes (Jah Hut, Temuan and Che Wong) aged 1 to 6 years from 162 households in 16 villages participated in this cross-sectional study. Children and mothers were measured for body weight and height. Mothers were interviewed for household socio-demographic information and diet diversity of children in the last 7 days. Diet diversity score (DDS) was calculated based on 15 food groups. Results: There was a high prevalence of underweight (50.9%) and stunting (61.6%) in Orang Asli children. For mothers, 11.1%, 27.8% and 7.4% were underweight, overweight and obese, respectively. Mean DDS of children was 6.38 [95% CI-6.10, 6.65] of the possible 15. Higher DDS of children was significantly related to older age (p&lt;0.05), the non Jahut sub-tribe (p&lt;0.01) and longer maternal years of schooling (p&lt;0.05). DDS was also positively related to weight-for-age z-scores (p&lt;0.001) and height-for-age z-scores (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Undernutrition remains a major nutrition problem among Orang Asli children living within the forest reserve.

However, long-term pollution, overfishing and rapid coastal development result in overexploitation and adverse environmental and ecological impacts. Previous studies focused on single species fishery management or merely the interpretation relevant laws whereas the views and perceptions of the stakeholders are often overlooked. Therefore, stakeholders' participation and co-management seem to challenge the future establishment of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Gueishan Island. This study focuses on the evaluation of stakeholders' perception and analyzes the critical success factors for MPA planning through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The results showed that although most fishermen do not fully understand the intention of MPAs, they pay much attention to the negotiations among stakeholders before an MPA is implemented. Thus, stimulating appreciation and education about conservation and MPAs is crucial while setting up a co-management mechanism is recommended for the implementation of such MPA.","journal":"Journal of Marine Science and Technology (Taiwan)","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Such a schedule can be implemented by constructing scales reflecting public judgments of the relative importance of adverse impacts on resources, or of activities causing such impacts. The importance scales can then be used to assess existing regulations and current management priorities and to serve as a guide for revisions and changes to current practice, for the design of new policy, for rationalizing regulatory controls, and for determining damage awards and other deterrence sanctions. The resulting evolution of a schedule can improve the consistency of resource use with community preferences by, for example, prescribing more severe restrictions on what are widely agreed to be more serious harms and lesser controls on less important ones.

To encourage its recognition and conservation, sustain benefits, this study analyses the place of plant species of NWFPs in household food security in Southern Nigeria. Data were collected from 400 households in Cross River and Enugu States of Southern Nigeria. Descriptive statistics and probit regression were used in data analysis. The study revealed that Bush mango (Irvingia gabonensis and I. wombolu), Ã¡fÃ ng (Gnetum africanum), oil bean (Pentaclatra macrophyla), African mesquite (Prosopis africana) and bread fruit (Treculia africana) were the plant species producing NWFPs that were mostly used by the respondents. NWFP appeared in the meals of the households for 43.20% of the time. The daily documentation of meals showed that Ã¡fÃ ng and Bush mango appeared mostly in meals of the households. Income from bread fruit (N27,116.67) was the highest, while the lowest (N15,000) income was from African bush pear and African star apple respectively. Household size, medium wealth, respondent being a civil servant and respondent being in business positively and significantly increase the likelihood of utilization of plant species of NWFPs. The high dependence of households on NWFPs and the high percentage of its appearance in meals justify increased attention by policy makers and inclusion in the national accounting framework in Nigeria.

In particular, few studies report how the conversion from tropical forest to technified cacao plantation affects the species richness and the community structure of herbs. We conducted surveys in 43 cacao plantations along the border of the Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi, ranging from agroforests to technified cacao, categorizing the plantations as rustic cacao, planted shade cacao, and technified cacao. We recorded 91 herb species. Of the 74 species determined to species level, 21 were also found in natural forests, while 53 were recorded only in agricultural habitats. Araceae was the most forest-dependent plant family while Asteraceae included the highest number of nonforest species. Overall, the presence of forest species was confined to moderately intensively managed rustic and planted shaded plantations. Distance from the forest, which has been identified as a crucial parameter for the diversity and composition of other taxa in cacao agroforests, only played a minimal role for herbs. Our study suggests that native forest herbs maybe more vulnerable to forest conversion than animal groups. The intensification of cacao plantation management increases the presence of weedy species to the detriment of native forest species. Â© 2011 The Author(s).

Predictions of a tremendous future increase of urbanization in Africa necessitate an investigation into the research on ecosystem goods and services in the urban green infrastructure of Africa. Ecosystem goods and services (ES) are described as the benefits humans derive directly or indirectly from ecosystem functions and are classified as supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural services. A literature study focusing on journal papers was conducted. Additionally a case study based on two masters studies was further refined. ES studies in African cities are biased towards South Africa and include assessments and economic valuations in which several different methods were used to determine direct consumptive and non-consumptive and indirect use values. Emphasis was placed on the multifunctional nature of ES. The main objectives of these studies were to sensitize policy makers, planners and the general public about the importance of biodiversity and ES. Ecosystem-based adaptation is discussed as the most appropriate approach in terms of applying knowledge about ES and their values in African cities as many residents still rely on ES from natural areas, but the major ecological, economic and political challenges are acknowledged. A case study focusing on domestic gardens (private green spaces) have indicated that the demand and supply of certain ES differ along a socio-economic gradient due to poor service delivery and smaller plots in the poorer areas mainly due to the legacy of separate development of the past. Where provisioning services are mainly outsourced in cities, it was found that plant species useful as food, medicine, etc. were more frequent in the gardens of poorer residents than in those of more affluent areas. The tendency to pay more for residential properties close to public open spaces, as in Europe, could not be statistically proven in the more affluent areas of a South African city, although the property values in proximity of public open spaces in some of the areas studied were lower than further away.

The growing need for urban employment is closely associated with the increase of squatting and informal settlements along the urban fringe, which contributes to habitat fragmentation and sprawling of cities. This increasing urbanisation is one of the main threats to biodiversity in the Grassland biome as the natural vegetation in and around cities in the North-West Province of South Africa is destroyed at an alarming rate. The lack of detailed ecological data is a major problem in the implementation of conservation-orientated policies in urban planning and management. This paper gives a brief overview of urban nature conservation in the world, the obstacles to implementation in South Africa and the importance of socio-economics and environmental legislation. We focus specifically on projects involving phytosociological studies and biotope mapping in cities in the western Grassland Biome of the North West Province. The visible presence of native vegetation is essential and integral to urban nature conservation. There is a vital need to present urban environmental data in a format that is convincing and useful to decision makers. We propose an integrated approach towards urban ecological studies culminating in effective urban nature conservation. Â© 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

{"author":"Cinner, J. E.; Bodin, Ã–","year":2010,"title":"Livelihood diversification in tropical coastal communities: A network-based approach to analyzing 'livelihood landscapes'","dAbstract":"Background: Diverse livelihood portfolios are frequently viewed as a critical component of household economies in developing countries. Within the context of natural resources governance in particular, the capacity of individual households to engage in multiple occupations has been shown to influence important issues such as whether fishers would exit a declining fishery, how people react to policy, the types of resource management systems that may be applicable, and other decisions about natural resource use. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper uses network analysis to provide a novel methodological framework for detailed systemic analysis of household livelihood portfolios. Paying particular attention to the role of natural resourcebased occupations such as fisheries, we use network analyses to map occupations and their interrelationships- what we refer to as 'livelihood landscapes'. This network approach allows for the visualization of complex information about dependence on natural resources that can be aggregated at different scales. We then examine how the role of natural resource-based occupations changes along spectra of socioeconomic development and population density in 27 communities in 5 western Indian Ocean countries. Network statistics, including in- and out-degree centrality, the density of the network, and the level of network centralization are compared along a multivariate index of community-level socioeconomic development and a gradient of human population density. The combination of network analyses suggests an increase in household-level specialization with development for most occupational sectors, including fishing and farming, but that at the community-level, economies remained diversified. Conclusions/Significance: The novel modeling approach introduced here provides for various types of livelihood portfolio analyses at different scales of social aggregation. Our livelihood landscapes approach provides insights into communities' dependencies and usages of natural resources, and shows how patterns of occupational interrelationships relate to socioeconomic development and population density. A key question for future analysis is how the reduction of household occupational diversity, but maintenance of community diversity we see with increasing socioeconomic development influences key aspects of societies' vulnerability to environmental change or disasters.

This paper explores the transition to decentralisation in marine resource management systems in three East African countries. The paper draws upon expert opinion and literature from both political science and linked social-ecological systems fields to guide exploration of five key governance transition concepts in each country: (1) drivers of change; (2) institutional arrangements; (3) institutional fit; (4) actor interactions; and (5) adaptive management. Key findings are that decentralized management in the region was largely donor-driven and only partly transferred power to local stakeholders. However, increased accountability created a degree of democracy in regards to natural resource governance that was not previously present. Additionally, increased local-level adaptive management has emerged in most systems and, to date, this experimental management has helped to change resource user's views from metaphysical to more scientific cause-and-effect attribution of changes to resource conditions.

In some instances, these adaptations can create feedbacks that amplify the change. Alternatively, other adaptations may dampen the change. We used semi-structured interviews with 240 fishers from nine Tanzanian coastal communities to explore responses to four hypothetical scenarios of increasingly severe declines in their average catch (10%, 20%, 30% and 50%). Overall, a higher proportion of fishers said they would respond to decline using amplifying adaptations (such as fishing harder) than dampening adaptations (such as reducing effort), particularly in the scenarios with lower levels of decline. We used a redundancy analysis to explore whether certain types of responses were related to the fishers' socioeconomic characteristics. Fishers that would employ amplifying responses had greater economic wealth but lacked options. Fishers who would adopt dampening responses possessed characteristics associated with having livelihood options. Fishers who would adopt neither amplifying nor dampening responses were less likely to belong to community groups and sold the largest proportion of their catch. This study provides novel contributions by differentiating aspects of adaptive capacity that will amplify versus dampen environmental change and by highlighting what the resource users' themselves say regarding responding to environmental change. Although direct policy application is limited by the study's hypothetical scenario nature, it provides a good beginning to incorporating resource users' voices into such policy discussions.

B.","year":2009,"title":"Gear-based fisheries management as a potential adaptive response to climate change and coral mortality","dAbstract":"1. Climate change is emerging as one of the greatest threats to coral reef ecosystems. Climate-induced warming events trigger coral bleaching and mortality, which can indirectly affect coral reef fishes. Managing fisheries across coral mortality events is expected to influence the persistence of species and reef recovery potential. The most common management recommendation has been to prohibit fishing using fisheries closures, but this response often has limited support from resource users. 2. Here, we explore an alternative of managing fishing gear commonly used in artisanal coral reef fisheries. We examined fisheries landing data from 15 sites in Papua New Guinea and Kenya to explore whether or how specific gears select for: (i) species that depend on coral reefs for feeding or habitat and are likely to be susceptible to the loss of coral, and (ii) different functional groups of fishes. 3. Only 6% of the fishes targeted by fishers were susceptible to the immediate effects of coral mortality; however, loss of habitat structure following coral mortality is expected to affect 56% of targeted species. 4. Importantly, 25% of target species had feeding characteristics (i.e. reef scrapers/excavators and grazers) that contribute to the recovery of coral reef ecosystems, and gears differed considerably in catches of these species. 5. Spear guns and traps target a high proportion of species likely to be affected by bleaching and key for the recovery of corals. These gears are strong candidates for management restrictions in reefs with high coral mortality. In contrast, line fishing catches the lowest proportion of susceptible and recovery-enabling species and is preferential for increasing recovery rates on coral reefs. 6. Synthesis and applications. Fisheries managers will require a range of tools to meet the novel challenges posed by climate change. This study presents a way to help reduce the negative impacts of climate change and potentially increase resilience of marine ecosystems by managing fishing gear. Specific gears used by artisanal fishers differentially target fish functional groups. In the coral reefs that we studied, traps and spear guns targeted a high proportion of species highly susceptible to coral mortality and critical to coral reef resilience through their top-down control. Given that full fisheries closures are not always practical, selectively banning or restricting fishing gears is a potentially powerful tool for reducing the detrimental ecosystem effects of climate change disturbances.

Compared to non-fishers, fishers were poorer, had higher occupational diversity, more participation in community decision-making, and higher scores on six dimensions of knowledge about marine resources. Fishers living adjacent parks had lower occupational diversity, higher fortnightly expenditures, greater knowledge of the effects of land-based pollutants and market demands than non-park fishers. These relationships may, however, be a result of urbanization near Kenya's marine parks, rather than the marine parks' effect on fishers' knowledge and livelihoods. Consistent with studies from other parts of the world, this study finds that there are aspects of Kenyan fishers' socioeconomic conditions and knowledge about the sea that characterize them as distinct from non-fishers.

Yet little is known about how socioeconomic factors influence the ability of communities to use customary management practices and whether socioeconomic transformations within communities will weaken conservation initiatives with a customary foundation. We used a comparative approach to examine how socioeconomic factors may influence whether communities use customary fisheries management in Papua New Guinea. We examined levels of material wealth (modernization), dependence on marine resources, population, and distance to market in 15 coastal communities. We compared these socioeconomic conditions in 5 communities that used a customary method of closing their fishing ground with 10 communities that did not use this type of management. There were apparent threshold levels of dependence on marine resources, modernization, distance to markets (< 16.5 km), and population (> 600 people) beyond which communities did not use customary fisheries closures. Nevertheless, economic inequality, rather than mean modernization levels seemed to influence the use of closures. Our results suggest that customary management institutions are not resilient to factors such as population growth and economic modernization. If customary management is to be used as a basis for modern conservation initiatives, cross-scale institutional arrangements such as networks and bridging organizations may be required to help filter the impacts of socioeconomic transformations.","journal":"Conservation Biology","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Our examination of social resilience focused on indicators of the flexibility of household livelihood portfolios and both formal and informal governance institutions, the capacity of communities to organize, their capacity to learn, and access to household assets and community infrastructure. In general, we found high levels of flexibility in formal institutions and livelihood portfolios and high levels of participation in decision-making and community groups. Together, these indicators suggest some latent capacity to adaptively manage resources, but this capacity may be offset by poor levels of trust between communities and resource managers, a poor understanding of the ways in which humans affect marine resources, inadequate feedback of ecological monitoring to communities, inflexibility in informal governance institutions, and a lack of assets to draw upon. We suggest that building desirable resilience in Madagascar's marine protected areas will require the following: investments in community-level infrastructure, projects to generate household income, and enhanced agricultural production to improve the well-being of communities; improvements in the capacity to learn through investments in formal and informal education; enhanced trust between park staff and local communities; empowerment of communities to govern and enforce natural resources; the increased accountability of leaders and transparency of governance processes; adequate cross-scale interaction with local, provincial, and national institutions; and the pursuit of these activities in ways that capitalize on community-specific strengths, such as high flexibility and the presence of sociocultural institutions such as taboos that regulate resource use.","journal":"Ecology and Society","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Research was conducted from April to August 2007, focusing on the small-scale fisheries sector of commercial divers. Information on fishers' awareness of current policies, fishers' attitudes concerning different aspects of fisheries regulation, and fishers' suggestions on how their fisheries should be managed, was gathered through structured interviews (including open and closed-ended questions), informal talks and participant observation. Results provide further evidence supporting the need for formally recognizing the fishers as key stakeholders in local fisheries, and for working cooperatively towards the design of management strategies and regulations that provide better stimulus for resource stewardship and discourage overfishing. Very importantly, this study suggests that there is strong support from resource users for implementing regulatory measures for local fisheries. Results could be used as a preliminary baseline to initiate the discussion among fishery stakeholders towards the development of species-specific management plans for the area, as required by the recently enacted fisheries act in Mexico, the \"Ley General de Pesca y Acuacultura Sustentables\".

Data on ability to recognise the photo of eight selected bird species were collected in October 2011, in relation to the respondents' gender, age, tribe and education. Almost all eight species were known by at least 50% of the respondents. The men, older people between 40 and 42 years of age and the Maasai tribe showed good or perfect ability in recognising these birds. Unexpectedly, we found that people with little or no education had greater ability of recognising birds than those who received secondary and/or higher education. Given that only approximately 50% of respondents recognised the selected bird species regardless of age, education, gender and tribe, we emphasise that education programmes on wildlife resources recognition and biodiversity conservation awareness raising activities are to be introduced to communities surrounding the western Serengeti ecosystem. We discuss the results and how to incorporate traditional knowledge into natural resource management, biodiversity conservation and the management of sustainable resource use.

It was established principally to protect Andean conifers, Podocarpus spp. In this introduction, first, we describe the methods that we used in our rapid appraisal of PNP. We detail our analytic perspective and the problem-oriented, contextual, and multi-method approach that we used. Second, we briefly describe PNP and its context. Our account of PNP management policy is a story about people who make up one large social process regarding how PNP will be used and who gets to decide. Within this social process, people are seeking values (e.g., well-being, wealth, respect) by using existing institutions and calling for new ones that use and affect resources in different ways. In this introduction we look at this social process, the idea of the \"common interest,\" and the need for management policy to help meet this goal. We also look at development and conservation as a decision-making process that must be understood and managed well if sustainability is to be had. The key to success in this regard, we argue, is to link \"authority\" and \"control\" in PNP management policy. Third, in this introduction we also give an overview of the articles in this volume and how they support this common interest outcome for the people in and around PNP.

So far, few studies have examined to which extent these policies have actually contributed to reforestation. This is the focus of our analysis, based on a case study in Vietnam. Because land access and land use were traditionally governed by common rules, we examine land use changes from an institutional perspective. We use the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, coupled with an historical perspective and the analysis of actors' perception and dominant narratives on land management and forests. Results show that national policies significantly interfered with local factors, leading to a complex course of decision-making and action. Substantial reforestation in the area was not a response by farmers to policy incentives but rather the unexpected outcome of the disruption of local institutions by these policies. We argue that, because national interventions have relied on false or exaggerated narratives and beliefs, their implementation is in conflict with the local reality in upland areas, leading to unpredictable and locally dependent outcomes. We defend hence the need for local level studies and also recommend considering local institutions for land use change analysis in contexts where land use systems are characterised by a high degree of human interaction.

M.","year":2009,"title":"Afforestation and forestry land allocation in northern Vietnam: Analysing the gap between policy intentions and outcomes","dAbstract":"Many tropical countries have recently implemented similar forest policies including large-scale afforestation programmes and the devolution of land-use rights. Their success in enhancing livelihoods and contributing to improved environmental services has been widely questioned. This paper discusses the impacts of state afforestation efforts and forestry land allocation on farmers' land-use decisions in northern Vietnam. It links policy outcomes with factors located beyond the local level by analysing the decision-making process at the policy implementation stage. Our study suggests that the current national afforestation campaign has not successfully involved households in the forestry sector and that forestry land allocation to households has often disrupted existing land-use systems with little impact on afforestation. These discrepancies between policy intentions and outcomes are partly linked to the relative freedom provinces have to interpret and adapt policies during the implementation stage. In this respect, the political and economic context has played a significant role in providing particular financial and bureaucratic incentives to the former State Forest Enterprises and to civil servants. However, we argue that these actors have been allowed or even encouraged to take advantage of these incentives by national policy-makers thanks to: (1) the lack of clarity or the poor adequacy of the policies designed at the central level, and (2) the blurred character of prevailing national discourses promoting afforestation and community-based forest management. We recommend that national policy-makers allow flexibility in policy implementation but develop mechanisms of accountability and control between the provincial and the central authorities.

Cambodia supports one of the only populations of three species (White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis, Slender-billed Vulture G. tenuirostris and Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus) outside of South Asia where diclofenac use is not widespread. Conservation of the Cambodian sub-populations is therefore a global priority. This study analyses the results of a long-term research programme into Cambodian vultures that was initiated in 2004. Population sizes of each species are estimated at 50-200+ individuals, ranging across an area of approximately 300 km by 250 km, including adjacent areas in Laos and Vietnam. The principal causes of vulture mortality were poisoning (73%), probably as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practices, and hunting or capture for traditional medicine (15%). This represents a significant loss from such a small population of long-lived, slow breeding, species such as vultures. Cambodian vultures are severely food limited and are primarily dependent on domestic ungulate carcasses, as wild ungulate populations have been severely depleted over the past 20 years. Local people across the vulture range still follow traditional animal husbandry practices, including releasing livestock into the open deciduous dipterocarp forest areas when they are not needed for work, providing the food source. Reducing threats through limiting the use of poisons (which are also harmful for human health) and supplementary food provisioning in the short to medium-term through 'vulture restaurants' is critical if Cambodian vultures are to be conserved.

The majority of PES programs have been implemented in situations where the institutional framework and property rights are strong and target the behaviours of private landowners. By contrast, this paper compares three PES programs from a forest landscape in Cambodia, where land and resource rights are poorly defined, governance is poor, species populations are low and threats are high. The programs vary in the extent to which payments are made directly to individuals or to villages and the degree of involvement of local management institutions. The programs were evaluated against three criteria: the institutional arrangements, distribution of costs and benefits, and the conservation results observed. The most direct individual contracts had the simplest institutional arrangements, the lowest administrative costs, disbursed significant payments to individual villagers making a substantial contribution to local livelihoods, and rapidly protected globally significant species. However, this program also failed to build local management organisations or understanding of conservation goals. By contrast the programs that were managed by local organisations were slower to become established but crucially were widely understood and supported by local people, and were more institutionally effective. PES programs may therefore be more sustainable when they act to empower local institutions and reinforce intrinsic motivations. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we explore various cultural and socioeconomic attributes of Bajau society that inform their views of the environment. These are shown to be grounded in a specific worldview reflecting socioeconomic status, perceptions of environmental causality, and spiritual belief systems. Until such views are recognized and integrated into resource management initiatives, we argue that groups such as the Bajau will continue to occupy a peripheral role in conservation, thereby undermining these policies and programs.

J.","year":1997,"title":"A gap-based approach for development of silvicultural systems to address ecosystem management objectives","dAbstract":"Foresters have traditionally managed forests with silvicultural systems that prescribe stand homogeneity for optimized tree growth. The primacy of timber as the dominant objective is giving way to broader objectives such as sustaining the function and dynamics of ecosystems, maintaining ecosystem diversity and resilience or protecting sensitive species, while providing for a variety of ecosystem services of value to humanity. Protection and production of more diverse forest values demands consideration of the fine-scale variability found within forest stands and an understanding of the spatial and temporal response of forest ecosystems to manipulation. Studies of gap dynamics have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of small-scale disturbance in forest ecosystems, but have been used little by foresters for predicting ecosystem response to partial cutting. We review the gap dynamics literature paying special attention to papers that use gap size or position as predictive variables for responses indicative of silvicultural success or maintenance of ecosystem function. Like canopy gaps created by natural tree death or windthrow, gaps are also generated by silvicultural systems which remove dominant trees. Results from the Date Creek silvicultural systems study in northwestern British Columbia presented here demonstrate the utility of a gap-based approach for understanding ecosystem responds to tree cutting. We propose a gap-based approach for study of stand response to silvicultural manipulation that: (1) aids development of cutting prescriptions that maintain functional mature or old-growth conditions; (2) refines and extends our understanding of how biological structures, organisms and ecosystem processes are affected by fine-scale variation within stands; and (3) leads to development of novel silvicultural systems that meet timber production objectives without compromising ecosystem management principles.","journal":"Forest Ecology and Management","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Few studies have investigated the utilitarian and cultural roles of forests and trees in an integrated manner. Most studies have been focused on indigenous communities with little attention given to the role of biodiversity in local communities living under non-traditional conditions. Furthermore most research has focussed on the extraction of resources in tropical rain forests and only recently have attempts been made to determine the contribution of temperate-zone vegetation types. The aim of this paper was to highlight the significance of plant diversity in the livelihoods of rural communities within the Valley Bushveld in South Africa. It documents the various uses of NTFP's, the species used, the amounts harvested and their value of nine different use categories. In total 103 plant species were used, but only 17 were recorded by over 10% of the households on a regular basis. The mean gross direct use value for the utilisation of wild plant resources amounts to $1591 per annum per household. The use of NFTP's is not purely utilitarian. Approximately one-third of the species and just over half of the total use value were for cultural purposes. This illustrates that plant diversity is important in serving the cultural needs of non-traditional local communities. Programmes for biodiversity conservation should heed its role in traditional cultures.","journal":"Forests Trees and Livelihoods","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

These principles have been notionally accepted by development planners and conservationists at all levels. Yet, throughout the tropical forest belt, they are being systematically overridden by international and national policies and development programmes, leading to increasing poverty, social conflict and rapid deforestation. Traditional knowledge and systems of land use have proved far more environmentally appropriate, resilient and complex than initially supposed by outsiders. Forest peoples have successfully opposed many socially and environmentally destructive development schemes proposed for their lands. However, these societies are not resisting all change: population increase and the internal dynamic for development have also created social and environmental problems. A review of community-based initiatives in South and South-East Asia shows that in some countries, positive initiatives have been taken by local and national governments to promote a community-based approach. Notable successes have been achieved but many other initiatives have failed. The examples show that, besides the four principles noted above, environmentally successful management also depends on innovative political organization at the community level.","journal":"Development and Change","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Project interventions seeking to achieve a 'balance' between conservation and development whereby biodiversity is conserved and people's livelihoods improve need to address these broad contextual issues. However, most attempts fail because they are not based upon understanding of system complexity, they assume \"win-win\" situations, they fail to plan for the impacts of society-wide changes happening beyond the project landscapes, and they use top-down - planning - approaches. In this paper we explore the use of system dynamics modelling for investigating trade-offs and synergies in landscape-scale approaches to conservation and development. We advocate the use of 'scoping models' because of their ability to incorporate complexity and promote social-learning in a participatory environment, while increasing the capacity of local actors to manage social-ecological complexity. We discuss their role in facilitating change in policies and practice in three landscapes in the tropics. Models do not provide a magic bullet solution and should not be used in isolation.

This paper explores what good governance is, how it can be measured and why it is relevant to communities' socioeconomic development goals. Horizontal accountability, used as a proxy for good governance, and people's perception of CBNRM benefits were documented through 236 individual interviews in five conservancies in the Caprivi Province (Namibia). These complex concepts were captured in order to strengthen performance assessments of CBNRM. Horizontal accountability was weak across the five conservancies studied and conservancy leaders could transfer more information to their constituents. Smaller and older conservancies displayed higher rates of information transfer, but horizontal accountability was not linked to different levels of socioeconomic benefits. In order to properly study the potential connections between good governance and the provision of socioeconomic benefits within CBNRM, the measures used in this study require further refinement.

We identified two major factors that distinguished the perceptions towards the two species: less people feared the puma than the jaguar; and most people believed that jaguars, but not pumas, were released into INP by local authorities. Interestingly, despite those major differences in these perceptions, feelings towards the two species tended to be the same. Perceptions towards jaguars were not influenced by the predation history of the properties, suggesting that the predation impact was not remarkable enough to influence local perceptions towards carnivores.

Orissa's extensive experience of community forest management (CFM) provides some valuable lessons and insights regarding: (a) how and why communities manage their forests; and (b) the sustainability of CFM initiatives. The paper discusses the following aspects of CFM in Orissa: (a) the conditions that give rise to the initiation of CFM; (b) the size and nature of the benefits and how they arc distributed among the various sub-groups of a community; (c) the factors affecting its sustainability, including conflicts and their management; and (d) communities' support needs. The principal research activity was a survey, primarily socio-economic, of 43 forest-dependent communities. CFM was examined in the context of people's livelihood systems as a whole, since these can affect the size and nature of any benefits they derive from forest protection and also their main reasons for deciding to protect. The authors conclude that CFM has made an important contribution to the regeneration and sustainable management of Orissa's forests and argue that the formal balance of control of forests be shifted further towards communities. They highlight the plurality of institutional and management arrangements that communities have developed and caution against forest departments imposing a standardised, blueprint approach, as has tended to happen in government Joint Forest Management (JFM) programmes.

It has been suggested that these systems empower local participants while promoting conservation. We reviewed three wildlife monitoring systems in indigenous lands and sustainable development reserves in Brazilian Amazonia and one in Namibian Caprivi conservancies, analyzing the strategies adopted and conditions that facilitated local empowerment, as well as potential impacts on conservation. This provided insights into potential avenues to strengthen empowerment outcomes of monitoring systems in Latin America and Africa. We assessed four dimensions of empowerment at individual and community scales: psychological, social, economic, and political. The conditions that facilitated local empowerment included the value of natural resources, rights to trade and manage resources, political organization of communities, and collaboration by stakeholders. The wide range of strategies to empower local people included intensifying local participation, linking them to local education, feeding information back to communities, purposefully selecting participants, paying for monitoring services, marketing monitored resources, and inserting local people into broader politics. Although communities were socially and politically empowered, the monitoring systems more often promoted individual empowerment. Marketing of natural resources promoted higher economic empowerment in conservancies in Namibia, whereas information dissemination was better in Brazil because of integrated education programs. We suggest that practitioners take advantage of local facilitating conditions to enhance the empowerment of communities, bearing in mind that increasing autonomy to make management decisions may not agree with international conservation goals. Our comparative analysis of cases in Latin America and Africa allows for a greater understanding of the relationships between resource monitoring systems, local empowerment, and conservation.

However, a review of these programs revealed that the majority are focused on marine and coastal fisheries. Globally, freshwaters and their fish assemblages represent some of the most threatened systems and taxa because of multiple anthropogenic stressors. There is an urgent need to harness the momentum of the sustainable seafood movement for marine systems to benefit all aquatic systems, including freshwater. Moreover, given that freshwater systems are at particular risk in developing countries in which small-scale fisheries dominate, it is essential to expand awareness campaigns, through grassroots initiatives that differ significantly from current awareness campaigns that are global in focus, involve industrialized large-scale fisheries, and assume significant exports of seafood. Addressing the limitations of marine campaigns is a logical first step before launching new programs aimed at inland fisheries. In the long term, failure of the sustainable seafood movement to incorporate freshwater fisheries will lead to public perception that these fisheries are not in peril and may allow unsustainable practices to continue.

The majority of wetland stakeholders in the Inner Niger Delta, Mali considered human health and sanitation the most important criteria of a list of challenges and water-related pressures. Yet, a methodology to integrate health risks and opportunities into wetland management plans has previously not been proposed, despite the clear links and substantial real-life challenges. In this paper, a framework is presented to do this in data-poor context structured around the process to evaluate and prioritise the appropriateness of management options to improve human health.In the data-poor context of the Inner Niger Delta, the selection of criteria and indicators, and the scoring of management options against these criteria and indicators has been done by a panel of stakeholders. Criteria were chosen to reflect the often difficult conditions in which management options need to be implemented and thus focused on the effectiveness and feasibility of management options to reduce the disease burden and the two major pathways for environmental disease transmission, namely contaminated water (pathogens) and stagnant water (parasites and organisms that can transmit them) at three wetland scales: urban areas, urban wetland and rural wetland. The feasibility for the sustainable implementation of a management option refers to the required institutional capacity and is scored by means of the concept of \"adaptive capacity\".The presented framework uses rapid assessment tools and simplified scoring methods and proved useful in explaining issues across sectors and scales, to promote mutual understanding and to achieve an integrated assessment of the appropriateness of management options.

In this paper, we demonstrate how two concepts-resource draw and economic reliance-provide the analytical means to improve targeting in tropical rain forests where protected areas often cover large, remote areas of forest with high biological diversity, and local populations are typically poor and settlements dispersed. Combining an \"asset-based\" conceptual approach to rural livelihoods and data from surveys conducted with forest peasant in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve area of Peru (n=263 households, eight villages), this study examines the empirical relations between the volume of extraction (draw) and the share of income (reliance) contributed by fishing, hunting, and resource extraction, as well as critical biological resources (moriche palm fruit, Mauritia flexuosa; paiche, Arapaima gigas; aquarium fish). Results indicate that resource draw can be highly concentrated among just a few households in selected villages, that economic reliance may or may not be associated with resource draw, and that the predictors of resource draw and reliance, such as land poverty, labour access, household lifecycle, or past experience, vary markedly across resource use activities. As such, our findings explicate heterogeneity in peasant forest resource use-pointing to the critical importance of differential household asset holdings-and challenge the prevailing assumption that asset poor households are the primary extractors of critical biological resources. Attention to differential patterns of resource use is crucial in the design of the next generation of conservation-development initiatives for tropical forests and rapid rural appraisal instruments can be readily refined to provide much needed information on resource draw and economic reliance.

In-depth household surveys conducted in three communities along the Ucayali River (n-=-68 households) and four communities on the MaraÅˆÎ¿n River (n-=-87) provided data on resource use, income generation, asset holdings and household coping strategies in the face of two common shocks - illness and major floods. Results indicated the high economic importance of artisanal fishing, with considerable specialisation evident in fishing at the household and community levels. When faced with adversity, forest people in the Upper Amazon turn more to the floodplain (to fish) than to the rain forest (to hunt or extract forest products) to cope with major shocks. It appears that floodplain fisheries are an important safety net for forest people living along rivers in humid tropical environments.

We examine the dynamic links in shifting cultivation systems among asset poverty, land use, and land cover in a community where poverty is persistent and primary forests have been replaced over time - with community enclosure - by secondary forests (i.e., fallows), orchards, and crop land. Land cover change is assessed using aerial photographs/satellite imagery from 1965 to 2007. Household and plot level data are used to track land holding, portfolios, and use as well as land cover over the past 30 y, with particular attention to forest status (type and age). Our analyses find evidence for two important types of \"land-use\" poverty traps - a \"subsistence crop\" trap and a \"short fallow\" trap - and indicate that the initial conditions of land holding by forest peasants have long-term effects on future forest cover and household welfare. These findings suggest a new mechanism driving poverty traps: insufficient initial land holdings induce land use patterns that trap households in low agricultural productivity. Path dependency in the evolution of household land portfolios and land use strategies strongly influences not only the wellbeing of forest people but also the dynamics of tropical deforestation and secondary forest regrowth.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

W.","year":2007,"title":"The equity and legitimacy of markets for ecosystem services","dAbstract":"Markets for ecosystem services are being promoted across the developing world, amidst claims that the provision of economic incentives is vital to bring about resource conservation. This article argues that equity and legitimacy are also critical dimensions in the design and implementation of such markets, if social development goals beyond economic gains are to be achieved. The article examines this issue by focusing on two communities involved in a project for carbon sequestration services of forests in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. The perceived legitimacy of the activities and the distribution of economic outcomes and project-related information are found to be mediated by organizational allegiances and the history of social relations regarding access to property and forest resources. Political affiliation determines the project's legitimacy, while the poorest farmers and women have been excluded from project design and implementation. The authors argue that pitfalls such as these contribute to reinforcing existing power structures, inequities and vulnerabilities, and suggest that this is a product of the nature of emerging markets. Markets for ecosystem services are, in effect, limited in promoting more legitimate forms of decision making and a more equitable distribution of their outcomes.

The framework is applied in the context of Mexico's Programme of Payments for Carbon, Biodiversity and Agro-forestry Services (PSA-CABSA), with an emphasis on its carbon component. The analysis shows that PSA-CABSA was promoted by civil society and its rules have been subject to continuous modifications over time. In the case of the carbon component, changes have been due to an original misunderstanding of how carbon projects should be designed, implemented, and carbon traded in actual markets. From a performance point of view, the paper shows that the programme has been well received by rural communities, and carbon payments have contributed to increase household income and to enhance forest management practices and organisational skills. The paper also highlights sources of institutional interplay with local institutions and international climate policy, and it reveals the importance of capacity and scale issues in securing an effective and fair implementation of PES. The conclusion provides some policy recommendations for the future development of PES initiatives in Mexico and elsewhere. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In practice, ecotourism has often failed to deliver the expected benefits to indigenous communities due to a combination of factors, including shortages in the endowments of human, financial and social capital within the community, lack of mechanisms for a fair distribution of the economic benefits of ecotourism, and land insecurity. Based on a review of experiences, we analyze the complex interaction among the factors shaping the success and failure of ecotourism experiences in indigenous communities, and we stress the need for a better approach to enhance the indigenous communities' livelihood possibilities coming from ecotourism, as well as to promote land tenure and communities' empowerment.

In Mexico, the decrees of creation of biosphere reserves state that rural communities with the right to use buffer zones must avoid deforestation and their land uses must become sustainable, a task which is not easily accomplished. The objectives of this paper are: (a) to analyze the conflict between people's livelihoods and ecosystem protection in the PAs of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas (SMC), paying special attention to the rates and causes of deforestation and (b) to review policy options to ensure forest and ecosystem conservation in these PAs, including the existing payments for environmental services system and improvements thereof as well as options for sustainable land management. We found that the three largest PAs in the SMC are still largely forested, and deforestation rates have decreased since 2000. Cases of forest conversion are located in specific zones and are related to agrarian and political conflicts as well as growing economic inequality and population numbers. These problems could cause an increase in forest loss in the near future. Payments for environmental services and access to carbon markets are identified as options to ensure forest permanence but still face problems. Challenges for the future are to integrate these incentive mechanisms with sustainable land management and a stronger involvement of land holders in conservation.

In this study, semi-structured interviews and a phytosociological inventory were employed to assess the effect of anthropogenic use of tree species of the gallery forest in the Brazilian Pampa. Eighty-four informants were interviewed and listed a total of 43 tree species, belonging to 23 botanical families. Four categories of use were identified for the referenced species: firewood, medicinal, food and timber. The three most important species were Blepharocalyx salicifolius, Eugenia uniflora and Salix humboldtiana. The phytosociological inventory suggests that the anthropogenic exploitation of the gallery forests is leading some tree species to local threat and/or extinction. Aiming to preserve the gallery forests, we suggest the re-evaluation of the local people attitudes, towards a sustainable use of the gallery forests and the reforestation of the river margins with native species producing palatable fruits, enabling the exploitation of non-wood products, as well as the establishment of animal species in this environment.","journal":"Uso antropogÃªnico de florestas de galeria do bioma pampa brasileiro","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This paper analyzed factors influencing local people's participation in forest management program in Sissili and Ziro provinces, southern Burkina Faso based on data collected through a household survey of 165 members of forest management groups using factor analysis and multiple regression. Factor analysis resulted in a three-factor solution, which accounted for 64.82% of the total variance. Participation in decision-making, followed by participation in forest conservation and economic benefits were found to be the main factors influencing participation in the forest management program. Gender, household size, income source, land tenure status and technical assistance also appeared to influence members' participation in the program. The results indicate that participatory management program can be enhanced by changing the administrative structure of forest management groups in order to empower members in decision-making processes. In addition, increasing women's participation and more equitable benefit-sharing among user groups are essential in improving the success of the participatory forest management program. Thus, policies reforms to improve the structure of the forest management groups and to establish equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms are essential to improve the participation of local people in the forest management program and, hence, require immediate attention.

This paper describes the Padu system as it functions at Pulicat lagoon, India, where it has enjoyed decades of legitimacy amongst its members, and has contributed to sustainable fishing. Recently, however, the Padu system has become unstable, driven by pressures of an expanding fishing population, reduced access to fishing grounds and a growing 'shared poverty'. In spite of this, fisher loyalty to uphold the Padu system remains strong. This raises questions about the broader social, political and cultural meanings of Padu, which extend beyond access to a lucrative fishery. The paper highlights a trade-off between the benefits received through Padu membership at a societal level through collective action, and the individual costs of partaking in 'shared poverty', which is inherently distributed unequally amongst fishing families. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future of the Padu system in Pulicat, drawing from evolutionary pathways of other Padu systems in the region. It is suggested that, in the Pulicat case, the high social values attributed to the Padu system, alongside complex power structures, may hinder institutional adaptation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

{"author":"Coulthard, S.","year":2012,"title":"Can we be both resilient and well, and what choices do people have? incorporating agency into the resilience debate from a fisheries perspective","dAbstract":"In the midst of a global fisheries crisis, there has been great interest in the fostering of adaptation and resilience in fisheries, as a means to reduce vulnerability and improve the capacity of fishing society to adapt to change. However, enhanced resilience does not automatically result in improved well-being of people, and adaptation strategies are riddled with difficult choices, or trade-offs, that people must negotiate. This paper uses the context of fisheries to explore some apparent tensions between adapting to change on the one hand, and the pursuit of well-being on the other, and illustrates that trade-offs can operate at different levels of scale. It argues that policies that seek to support fisheries resilience need to be built on a better understanding of the wide range of consequences that adaptation has on fisher well-being, the agency people exert in negotiating their adaptation strategies, and how this feeds back into the resilience of fisheries as a social-ecological system. The paper draws from theories on agency and adaptive preferences to illustrate how agency might be better incorporated into the resilience debate. Copyright Â© 2012 by the author(s).

Sustainable land management (SLM) is fundamental to achieving the goals of all three Conventions. Changes in land management undertaken to address dryland degradation and desertification can simultaneously reduce net greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to conservation of biodiversity. Management to protect and enhance terrestrial carbon stocks, both in vegetation and soil, is of central importance to all three conventions. Protection of biodiversity conveys stability and resilience to agro-ecosystems and increases carbon storage potential of dryland systems. SLM improves livelihoods of communities dependent on the land. Despite these complementarities between the three environmental goals, tradeoffs often arise in their pursuit. The importance of human-environment interactions to the condition of land compels attention to adaptive management. In order to reconcile concerns and agendas at a higher strategic level, identification of synergies, conflicts, trade-offs, interconnections, feedbacks and spillover effects among multiple objectives, drivers, actions, policies and time horizons are crucial. Once these issues are transparent, coordinated action can be put into place across the three multilateral environmental agreements in the development of strategies and policy measures to support SLM.

Although these preserves appear to be a robust approach to rainforest conservation, their establishment resulted in significant conflicts between the villagers and the Western NGOs that assisted in raising funds for the preserves. The principles of indigenous control were unexpectedly difficult to accept by western conservation organizations who, ultimately, were unwilling to cede decision-making authority to indigenous peoples. Conversely, ecocolonialism, the imposition of western conservation paradigms and power structures on indigenous peoples, proved to be incompatible with indigenous concepts of conservation and human dignity. Even well-intentioned conservation efforts by NGOs may fail if there is an unwitting disparagement of the traditional knowledge, culture, political systems, and integrity of indigenous peoples.

This article describes two initiatives for co-management of women dominated cockle (Anadara spp.) fisheries implemented in Zanzibar Island of Tanzania and in Nicaragua that were based on a Fiji model. In each case, significant progress was made at the pilot scale but required adaptation to the community and national context. The Nicaragua case resulted in increasing densities of cockles inside and outside small scale no-take zones in a small estuary after a two-year period of implementation. In Zanzibar, out of several no-take sites established on reef flats, only one showed similar results. Other sites' poor performance is likely due to poor site selection, small size, and non-compliance. Varying degrees of poaching affected both locations and continues to be an issue. In Zanzibar, local and national government played highly supporting roles whereas in Nicaragua, local government was supportive but national government continues to exhibit top-down decision-making, while still evaluating the alternative co-management approach. In both cases, university extension initiatives were influential in building community capacity for management and playing an advocacy role with national government. Both locations are poised for scaling up to more geographic sites as well as fostering policy change that can lead to more integrated and ecosystem-scale approaches to sustainable fisheries management.

However, the transfer of rights and associated power to forest communities is usually partial. The view of property as composed of â€²bundles of rightsâ€² allows for the disaggregation of rights transferred from government to local people. In practice, it is common that rights held by natural resource stakeholders encompass only part of the rights bundle. This partial transfer of rights shapes community forestry institutions and the manner in which they function. When communities and state agencies share responsibilities and benefits of forest management, they collaborate within co-management systems. Co-management systems are attractive to governments because they open avenues for local participation in resource governance and more equitable benefit-sharing while maintaining some level of state control. However, co-management systems can place a greater burden on community level actors without providing the corresponding benefits. As a result, co-management can fail to meet expectations. In response, the promotion of community forestry may require greater emphasis on adjusting forest regulatory frameworks, institutions, and agencies, to allow more freedom by community-level actors in developing forest management systems.

Using household surveys and a coral reef interaction index (CRII), we obtained relative levels of dependency and impacts of fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism on coral reefs for livelihood. Results show that overall dependency on coral reefs remains high despite its decreasing quality. Socio-economic profiles reveal steep hurdles in shifting fishers to aquaculture. Both aquaculture and fisheries will continue to grow and eventually compete for space if left unmanaged further resulting in reduced reef quality. Shifts of fishers to tourism-based and other low-capital requirement mariculture (e.g., sea ranching) are more realistic than the expectation of absorbing fishers into current aquaculture businesses. Strengthening local coastal governance capacity to improve proactive responses for micro-macro development interactive synergy will also help reduce the impacts of development on reefs, Improving safety nets for coastal communities through skills enhancement and supplemental livelihood options that facilitate stewardship and reef recovery is an imperative. Transforming the lessons learned at village level actions to sustain municipal scale programs and institutional cooperation among stakeholders such as through marine protected area networks remain a challenge.

A major reason why past conservation management initiatives have failed to reach their goals has been the lack of compliance of local communities with management rules and regulations. This is due largely to actual, perceived, or expected economic losses to communities dependent upon natural resources for survival. Hence a key role of management should be to maintain or improve the economic status of local people. To work towards this aim we need to understand local resource use patterns and the economic importance of marine and coastal resources, quantify local dependence on natural resources, and describe and support existing livelihood strategies. This chapter outlines some of the local-scale complexities in terms of natural resource use that must be considered when attempting to manage an area with high local dependence on those natural resources. Actual dependence on marine and coastal resources is quantified using a detailed case study of the Kaledupa sub-district within the Wakatobi. The importance of marine and coastal resources to the local economy is highlighted along with some of the complex livelihood strategy patterns demonstrated throughout the Kaledupa sub-district.","journal":"","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

A methodology for collaboratively monitoring these system attributes and key variables was tested in four localities in South Africa. Our results suggest that creating the conditions that facilitate self-organization, and particularly cross-scale institutional linkages, is the major challenge facing attempts to initiate adaptive co-management. Factors requiring greater attention include community perceptions of support from outside agencies, access to long-term funding for adaptive decision making, and access to reliable information about changes in natural resources and legal options for the formation of decision-making bodies.

{"author":"Cunningham, A. B.","year":1994,"title":"INTEGRATING LOCAL PLANT RESOURCES AND HABITAT MANAGEMENT","dAbstract":"The use of wild plant resources as a source of basic needs is an important aspect of multiple-use of land in much of Africa, ranging from vegetation with a low species diversity, high biomass production and resilience to harvesting (e.g. Phragmites reedbeds, Cymbopogon grasslands) through to vegetation with a high diversity of species (and plant life-forms), with a multiple of uses and often low resilience to resource harvesting (e.g. medicinal plants, pole cutting, fuelwood from Afro-montane forest). Complexity and costs of managing sustainable use of wild populations increase markedly with an increasing number of uses and resource users. It is suggested that if the primary objective of core conservation areas is accepted to be the maintenance of habitat and species diversity, then the limited money and manpower available for management of core conservation areas in southern Africa limits sustainable harvesting use of plant resources to low diversity, low conservation priority vegetation types or encroaching species. For high diversity, high conservation priority sites such as Afro-montane or Coastal evergreen forest, the emphasis must be on providing alternative sources of supply to resource users outside of core areas. Botanical gardens staff, with their horticultural experience, can play a very important role through 'bulking up' material for supply to small farmers, herbalists and introducing additional species for agro-forestry. Botanical gardens can play a greater role in the establishment of field gene banks and ex situ conservation of vulnerable species. They can also provide a valuable educational and research role on mass production techniques to boost local stocks of threatened and commercially valuable species for cultivation by local people, whether farmers or specialist users (e.g. herbalists) in the country of origin as a means of generating employment and restoring local self-sufficiency.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

The concept has now been adopted by many international agreements and national governments and is in the process of being implemented. This paper seeks to review the literature and to analyze the understanding of the subject. The term is defined and its implementation in fisheries and for all marine uses is analyzed. It has been concluded that to understand marine ecosystem based management one must consider ecosystems as complex adaptive systems which can show changes at higher levels from actions and processes occurring at lower levels. Recognizing that humans are part of these complex adaptive systems is vital in that their actions along with other processes can lead to transformations in ecosystem functioning. This recognition is also important to show how society can sustainably exploit these resources and that the inclusion of all stakeholders in the management process is necessary to legitimize the process. The uses of the precautionary principle along with adaptive management are seen to be useful tools in implementing these insights into the management of natural resources. Finally, the need for reducing consumption of fish is considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","journal":"Marine Policy","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Having agreed to limit seahorse (Hippocampus) exports to sustainable levels, signatories to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) were offered the option of a single 10-cm minimum size limit (MSL) as an interim management measure for all Hippocampus species (â‰¥34). Although diverse stakeholders supported the recommended MSL, its biological and socioeconomic implications were not assessed quantitatively. We combined population viability analysis, model sensitivity analysis, and economic information to evaluate the trade-off between conservation threat to and long-term cumulative income from these exploited marine fishes of high conservation concern. We used the European long-snouted seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus) as a representative species to compare the performance of MSLs set at alternative biological reference points. Our sensitivity analyses showed that in most of our scenarios, setting the MSL just above size at maturity (9.7 cm in H. guttulatus) would not prevent exploited populations from becoming listed as vulnerable. By contrast, the relative risk of decline and extinction were almost halved - at a cost of only a 5.6% reduction in long-term catches - by increasing the MSL to the size reached after at least one full reproductive season. On the basis of our analysis, a precautionary increase in the MSL could be compatible with sustaining fishers' livelihoods and international trade. Such management tactics that aid species conservation and have minimal effects on long term catch trends may help bolster the case for CITES trade management of other valuable marine fishes.

Women and men in coastal communities depend chiefly on the sea for subsistence. Over fifty percent of the dietary protein requirements of coastal communities are derived from municipal fisheries and shallow coastal habitats (reef fishes, marine plants, and mangroves. Coastal populations are young and expanding at rates that exceed regional and national averages. Expanding human pressures and man-made disturbances (over harvesting, destructive fishing, siltation, etc.) that offset natural processes are destroying habitats and creating protein food security crises and increasing malnutrition. At the same time conflicts among users of coastal resources are escalating. Access constraints, gender inequities, and cultural barriers stymie options for women and men to plan their families and create alternative livelihoods. National and local government agencies are addressing food security concerns through vertical policies and programs (e.g., fisheries management, integrated coastal management. The IPOPCORM project uses a cross-sectoral approach and quasi-experimental evaluation design to test the hypothesis thatfood security will be achieved more quickly when coastal resources management (CRM) and reproductive health (RH) management are implemented together. The purpose of this article is to review the project's experience and highlight the trends observed in program monitoring and evaluation during 2001-2004, which suggest better impact on RH, CRM, and gender indicators in the sites where the synergistic approach is being applied.

The CRM, RH and integrated CRM+RH interventions were tested in three island municipalities of Palawan.

Regression analyses indicate the CRM+RH intervention generated higher impacts on human and ecosystem health outcomes compared to the independent CRM and RH interventions. Improvements in coral and mangrove conditions are attributed to the effects of protective management by collaborating peoples' organizations. The same institutions managed RH activities that enabled contraceptive access and a significant decrease in the average number of children born to women in the study area.

Cambodia is one of the six Asian LDCF recipients and with UNDP support is implementing the first adaptation project to arise from its National Adaptation Program of Action. Drawing on primary research conducted in August 2010 through interviews with key stakeholders, this article investigates the project for the likely benefits and challenges it will face in promoting institutional, infrastructural, and community resilience to climate change impacts. We find that the country's ongoing decentralization reforms offer an effective opportunity to mainstream climate change planning into sub-national government operations, but that competing priorities for immediate investment in education, roads, and healthcare may prevent government officers from sustaining a focus on preventative adaptation measures. We conclude that through careful planning, water resources infrastructure and agricultural practices can be designed to withstand climate variability and avoid the need to replace or rehabilitate systems whose specifications were prematurely determined by international donors.

Through the Forum, a strong link between fishermen and researchers has been established. Some research projects are being developed according to the needs of the fishermen. To develop research projects related to community needs means to produce results in a short time even in the absence of accurate scientific data. The use of the precautionary approach is fundamental in these situations. Results of the research are presented to the fishermen, and the possible management alternatives and the consequences of each alternative appear after intensive discussions with the fishermen, backed by the scientific knowledge supported by the traditional knowledge. Research results constitute the framework under which the suggestions and opinions from fishermen and other fishery-related groups will help to build the most adequate management solution. Fishermen are involved in resources management from the beginning of the process, discussing the problems, the alternatives to solve the problems and the consequences of each alternative. Decision-making is a collective process and responsibilities are shared. Although not all the community needs will be satisfied as well as not all the science requirements will be attained, the objective is, in fact, to find a way to adjust community needs to science requirements, aiming ecological balance, social justice and economic return.

Black plum (Vitex doniana) is an indigenous fruit tree species important for the livelihoods of rural populations. Currently, there is renewed national and international interest in black plum, and it has emerged as a priority species for domestication in Africa. The present work addressed farmers' indigenous knowledge of the use and management of the species among different socio-cultural groups in Benin, taking into account gender differences. The specific objective of this work was to study the knowledge, uses, local gathering practices and management systems of V. doniana that are part of the traditions of the communities in Southern Benin. Materials and methods. A total of 150 participants randomly selected from three socio-cultural groups provided survey responses. Information collected mainly referred to the motivation of respondents to conserve black plum trees on their land, the local uses and the management practices to improve the regeneration and production of the black plum. Results and discussion. The study showed that knowledge of black plum is well distributed in the community. However, people have different interests in using black plum and there is variable knowledge of use and management practices. The food and medicinal categories were the most important uses. There were no significant differences in knowledge of the management and utility of black plum between men and women, or across socio-cultural groups. Conclusion. Given its value to the communities in southern Benin, black plum should be prioritized for domestication.

Using concepts from the literature on participation, conservation, and political ecology, this research explored the participation of marginal groups, i.e., poor, women, lower caste, and landless, in management institutions in Nepal's Annapurna Conservation Area. Field work for this research was conducted through the use of interviews and participant observation during August-October 2010. Results show that although marginal groups were involved in local management institutions, their representation was minimal and had not led to meaningful participation or empowerment to influence the decisions being made in conservation and development programs. Our study findings indicate that the involvement of marginal groups in local initiatives is complex and influenced by several factors. The study concludes that the Annapurna Conservation Area Project needs to re-orient its conservation projects by adopting a more inclusive form of participation and move beyond the quota system.

Local societies along with their knowledge about the mangrove also are endangered, while they are still underrepresented as scientific research topics. With the present study we document local utilization patterns, and perception of ecosystem change. We illustrate how information generated by ethnobiological research can be used to strengthen the management of the ecosystem. This study was conducted in the Godavari mangrove forest located in the East-Godavari District of the state Andhra Pradesh in India, where mangroves have been degrading due to over-exploitation, extensive development of aquaculture, and pollution from rural and urbanized areas (Kakinada). One hundred interviews were carried out among the fisherfolk population present in two mangrove zones in the study area, a wildlife sanctuary with strong conservation status and an adjacent zone. Results from the interviews indicated that Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh., a dominant species in the Godavari mangroves, is used most frequently as firewood and for construction. Multiple products of the mangrove included the bark of Ceriops decandra (Griff.) Ding Hou to dye the fishing nets and improve their durability, the bark of Aegiceras corniculatum (L.) Blanco to poison and catch fish, and the leaves of Avicennia spp. and Excoecaria agallocha L. as fodder for cattle. No medicinal uses of true mangrove species were reported, but there were a few traditional uses for mangrove associates. Utilization patterns varied in the two zones that we investigated, most likely due to differences in their ecology and legal status. The findings are discussed in relation with the demographic and socio-economic traits of the fisherfolk communities of the Godavari mangroves and indicate a clear dependency of their livelihood on the mangrove forest. Reported changes in the Godavari mangrove cover also differed in the two zones, with significantly less perceptions of a decrease in the protected area, as compared to the adjacent non-protected area. A posteriori comparisons between sequential satellite imagery (retrospective till 1977) and respondents that were at least 15 years back then, revealed a mangrove decrease which was however perceived to different extents depending on the area with which the fishermen were familiar. While local needs had not been incorporated in the existing policy, we created a framework on how data on ethnobotanical traditions, fishery-related activities and local people's perceptions of change can be incorporated into management strategies.

Yet, through retrospective research scientists can approach and understand ecosystem changes. This contributes to the fundamental understanding of both human-induced and natural dynamics in ecosystems world-wide. This also holds for fast changing coastal areas with mangrove ecosystems, which are important for biodiversity, for coastal protection, and for the daily livelihood of millions of people in tropical coastal developing countries. In addition, retrospective research generates a basis for predictions that can be used early on to protect an ecosystem. In attempting to protect ecosystems from adverse human-induced change and destruction, and to manage them for sustainability, scientists are only beginning to investigate and understand natural ecosystem dynamics. It is important and advisable to gather, combine and analyse all possible data that allow a researcher to look back in time. This paper reviews the available retrospective methods, and highlights the transdisciplinary way (i.e. combination between basic and applied sciences on one hand, and social and human sciences on the other) in which retrospective research on a scale between months and centuries can be carried out, but it also includes methods on larger scales that may be marginally relevant. The paper particularly emphasizes the lack of transdisciplinary (not interdisciplinary) integration between sciences in retrospective research on mangrove forests in the past. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This is challenged by research claiming that many efforts fail to match practice to rhetoric. South Africa has made strong commitments to fulfill the dual goals of conservation and development, and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park is promoted as an example of this. We explore present and potential outcomes of conservation and development interventions in a community bordering the Wetland Park through the perspective of different stakeholders, with the aim of uncovering opportunities and risks. In terms of improving local livelihoods as well as involvement in conservation, the success of the studied interventions varied. Local communities may accept restrictions on resource use as a result of realistic and fairly negotiated trade-offs, but if perceived as unjust and imposed from above, then mistrust and resistance will increase. In this area, collaboration between conservation organizations and the local community had improved, but still faced problems associated with unequal power relations, unrealistic expectations, and a lack of trust, transparency, and communication. As unsustainable efforts are a waste of funds and engagement, and may even become counterproductive, policy visions need to be matched by realistic allocations of staff, time, funds, and training. At the national and international level, the true cost of conservation has to be recognized and budgeted for if efforts at integrating conservation and development are to succeed.

Despite these efforts, cacao production is declining and is being replaced by less diverse systems that have lower biodiversity value. Understanding the factors that influence household land use is essential in order to promote cacao agroforestry systems as a viable livelihood strategy. We incorporate elements of livelihoods analyses and socioeconomic data to examine cacao agroforestry systems as a livelihood strategy compared with other crops in Talamanca. Several factors help to explain the abandonment of cacao agroforestry systems and their conversion to other land uses. These factors include shocks and trends beyond the control of households such as crop disease and population growth and concentration, as well as structures and processes such as the shift from a subsistence to a cash-based economy, relative prices of cacao and other cash crops, and the availability of market and government support for agriculture. We argue that a livelihoods approach provides a useful framework to examine the decline of cacao agroforestry systems and generates insights on how to stem the rate of their conversion to less diverse land uses.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

All authors have used the Ramsar definition of wetlands and the World Health Organization definition of human health. The papers (several are reviews) cover a range of wetlands and diseases from mosquito-borne to snail or pathogen vectors. Mosquito management is a common theme, illustrating, for the eastern USA, that wetland damage from the early to mid twentieth century can be ameliorated by careful restoration and, for Australia, that damage may be avoided. Constructed wetlands provide an opportunity to create ecosystem services and wetland value such that careful design and operation can minimise mosquito risks. Although the papers focus on negative health impacts of wetlands they deal with these to minimise health risks while restoring or maintaining wetland function or by exploring knowledge needs that would facilitate wise management.

In this paper, we demonstrate that an analysis of locally recognized land-use rules and regulations embedded in local institutions can inform remote-sensing approaches by helping: (1) to elucidate some of the local perceptions, criteria and interactions with outside agencies that drive conservation actions and (2) to better interpret the spatial patterns of land-use change and forest conservation revealed by remote-sensing data. Based on a case study of a forest ejido from the Maya Zone of Quintana Roo, Mexico, we evaluate changes in forest cover and in local land-use regulations before and after the initiation in the mid-1980s of a community forestry program, the Plan Piloto Forestal (PPF). Methods included development of a time series of land cover maps based on LANDSAT imagery from 1976, 1988, 1991, 1997 and 2000, as well as interviews and participant observation with local farmers and community leaders. Results indicate a high degree of forest conservation on community lands with net rates of forest loss of 0.6-0.7%/year. Locally recognized conservation regulations included a number of forest reserves as well as regulations which protect specific forest types, resulting from both local initiatives and interventions of external agencies. These initiatives included but were not limited to the PPF, highlighting the importance of evaluating community-based conservation programs within a broader historical context. Conservation regulations protecting an important commercial non-timber forest product (Manilkara zapota) pre-dated the PPF and may have facilitated its implementation. In the most accessible agricultural areas, the only mature forest patches were customary forest reserves and an area regenerated from secondary forests, protected due to enrichment plantings of commercial timbers. Recognition of local Maya terminology used to distinguish forest types was crucial for proper interpretation of local land-use regulations, which revealed that less-valued forest types may not be adequately protected on community lands. We suggest that future research should examine the significance of the less-valued forest types for global biodiversity conservation. In addition careful consideration of the historical antecedents and community institutions which may have facilitated the implementation of the Plan Piloto Forestal will be important for the successful application of this model of community forestry to other socio-economic and cultural contexts.

We employed interviews and ecological inventories in two villages in order to (1) evaluate the local perception of the conservation status of important plant resources; (2) compare patterns of plant use; and (3) compare perceived conservation status with population structure and abundance in the field. One-third of the 35 species examined were perceived to be threatened or declining. These were predominantly used locally for construction or sold commercially, but were not necessarily rare in the field. The destructiveness of harvest was the most consistent predictor of conservation status in both villages. Contrasting patterns were found in the two villages for the frequency of plant harvest and the relationship of this variable with conservation status. We suggest that local knowledge is an efficient means to rapidly assess the status of a large number of species, whereas population structure analysis provides an initial evaluation of the impact of harvest for selected species.","journal":"Economic Botany","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Balancing agriculture and forest conservation requires knowledge of how agricultural land uses evolve in landscapes with forest conservation initiatives. Based on a case study from Quintana Roo, Mexico, and remote sensing data, we investigated land use and land cover change (LUCC) in relation to accessibility (from main settlement and road) in search of evidence for agricultural expansion and/or intensification after the initiation of a community forestry program in 1986. Intensification was through a shortening of the fallow period. Defining the sampling space as a function of human needs and accessibility to agricultural resources was critical to ensure a user-centered perspective of the landscape. The composition of the accessible landscape changed substantially between 1976 and 1997. Over the 21-year period studied, the local population saw the accessible landscape transformed from a heterogeneous array of different successional stages including mature forests to a landscape dominated by young fallows. We detected a dynamic characterized by intensification of shifting cultivation in the most accessible areas with milpas being felled more and more from young fallows in spite of a preference for felling secondary forests. We argue that the resulting landscape provides a poorer resource base for sustaining agricultural livelihoods and discuss ways in which agricultural change could be better addressed through participatory land use planning. Balancing agricultural production and forest conservation will become even more important in a context of intense negotiations for carbon credits, an emerging market that is likely to drive future land changes worldwide.

This is of particular concern because there is growing evidence that human well-being is enhanced by exposure to nature. However, the specific qualities of greenspaces that offer the greatest benefits remain poorly understood. One possibility is that humans respond positively to increased levels of biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate the lack of a consistent relationship between actual plant, butterfly, and bird species richness and the psychological well-being of urban greenspace visitors. Instead, well-being shows a positive relationship with the richness that the greenspace users perceived to be present. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy, which we investigate, is that people generally have poor biodiversity-identification skills. The apparent importance of perceived species richness and the mismatch between reality and perception pose a serious challenge for aligning conservation and human well-being agendas.

Using social and ecological data from a rapid assessment of 31 MPAs and their associated communities in the wider Caribbean, this study investigates stakeholder participation in MPA planning and management, and how participants' views of process quality relate to MPA performance. Findings indicate that (1) participants tended to be male, resource users, participate in community organizations, and have lived fewer years in the community associated with an MPA than non-participants; (2) simply participating was not associated with perceptions of the social and ecological performance of MPAs, however, perceptions of process quality were positively related to views of performance; and (3) resource users' perceptions of an MPA's ecological performance were likely shaped by a variety of factors.

Four main habitat types predominated until recently: (a) perennial marsh, (b) seasonal marsh, (c) silt dune, and (d) qa'a (or saline mudflat). Presently, about 90% of the former wetland area within the reserve is highly degraded and Tamarix scrub is quickly developing in these areas. The seasonal marshes have been dry since 1996, and presently are highly degraded. One endemic fresh water fish, Aphanius sirhani, is known to occur only in the Azraq Oasis. The Oasis is a refuge for some of the Palearctic species such as Camaeleo camaeleon, Malpolon monspessulanus insignitus and Natrix tessellata. The Oasis is considered the most important bird area (IBA) in Jordan. Over 300 species of birds are recorded in the area, which until recently was a significant area for breeding and non-breeding water birds. The traditional people of Azraq Basin are pastoral nomads, and the wetlands of Azraq were a key element in their livelihoods. Most of the Bedouin now have resident lifestyles. This study shows the nefarious impact of humans on Azraq and suggests conservation issues and management practices in the Oasis. Socio-economic aspects of the reserve and the involvement of local communities in conservation are highlighted and assessed in the context of the management plan produced for the Oasis. Results of species inventories and evaluation features for rehabilitation, long-term objectives for management and proposed action plan prescriptions have been synthesized. Environmental relationships that may have implications for management in terms of grazing, fire and hydrology are also indicated.","journal":"Annals of Arid Zone","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

However, little information is available on the on-site causes of DFD in these areas. This paper estimates the levels of DFD and identifies the drivers in the Ankasa Conservation Area (ACA) in Ghana as a case study. A survey was used to identify both direct and underlying factors that promote the DFD. The extent of deforestation was estimated using satellite images. The survey data were analyzed using rankings and ordinal logistic regression techniques, while digital image classification and change detection were used to analyze land cover changes. The results show that DFD occurred at a higher rate in the periphery of the ACA compared to the core-protected and the farthest areas. Agricultural and wood harvesting activities were the main direct causes of DFD. Poverty and large in-migrations of people for cocoa farming were important underlying economic and population growth factors. To address these problems and enable ACA to contribute more to biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, the community resource management institutions should be fully adopted and strengthened and priority given to livelihood improvement and ecosystem services provision in the periphery of the ACA.

Storage of carbon in the rapidly grown biomass of this species creates special interest in the arena of climate change mitigation practices. To understand the public perceptions of the effect of the casuarina shelterbelt and carbon storage potential in the Bangladesh coast, a socio-biological study was conducted in the Parki beach area, where Casuarina equisetifolia is the major tree species. This study was conducted by a questionnaire survey to find out the observation of coastal people and to assess environmental, economic and social impacts of the casuarina shelterbelt. The study found that the shelterbelt reduced wind speed, increased the size of sand dunes, improved the aesthetic value, increased the protection facilities against cyclones, and enhanced the attractiveness of the beach for tourism. Although casuarina trees have inhibited the native species as undergrowth, the shelterbelt has increased the supply of fuel-wood for local people. The aboveground biomass density in the shelterbelt was found to be 162.58 Â± 4.52 t ha-1 with a mean annual increment of 8.56 Â± 0.24 t ha-1 yr-1, while the aboveground carbon density was found to be 73.16 Â± 2.04 t ha-1 with a mean annual increment of 3.85 Â± 0.11 t ha-1 yr-1. The study is expected to contribute to the field of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Bangladesh.

This area mostly comprises of small islands, having unique characteristics of marine resources and quite a lot of endemic species such as turtles, dugongs, and dolphins. This area also has quite complex and diverse resources ecosystem, resulting a variety of illegal practices in natural resources utilization. This study was aimed to analyze the fisher characteristics, and try to reveal social, economic and cultural factors which lead to natural resources degradation. Result shows that: (1) social problems faced by the community are the limited access to meet the needs of education, health, light, clean water, clothing, food and shelter as well as limited information of eco-friendly natural resources technology utilization; (2) this limited access triggers the community to increase revenue by optimizing the utilization of resources in the ecosystems of the island, mangrove, sea grass, coral reefs and open waters; (3) low income and high expenditure eliminate the implementation of local wisdom in the use of natural resources in sustainable way; and (4) the level of compliance and trustfulness of the community towards the leaders are still exist, hence can be used as a key component in motivating people in the management of South-East Aru conservation area.","journal":"AACL Bioflux","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This paper describes a simple and cost-effective, field-based biodiversity monitoring system developed specifically for areas where 'specialist staff' is lacking. We discuss the preliminary lessons learned from protected areas in the Philippines. Whilst the monitoring system aims to identify trends in biodiversity and its uses so as to guide management action, it also promotes the participation of local people in the management, stimulates discussions about conservation amongst stakeholders and builds the capacity of park staff and communities in management skills. In addition, it seeks to provide people with direction regarding the aims of protected areas, and reinforces the consolidation of existing livelihoods through strengthening community-based resource management systems. The field methods are: (1) standardised recording of routine observations, (2) fixed point photographing, (3) line transect survey, and (4) focus group discussion. Both bio-physical and socio-economic data are used and given equal importance. The system can be sustained using locally available resources. The approach is useful in countries embarking on shared management of park resources with local communities, where rural people depend on use of natural ecosystems, and where the economic resources for park management are limited. We hope this paper will encourage other countries to develop their own biodiversity monitoring system, letting its development become a means for capacity building whilst at the same time supporting the creation of ownership.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Implementation challenges include linking remote sensing and national forest inventories of carbon stocks, to local implementation and measuring carbon loss from forest degradation. Community-based forest monitoring can help overcome some of these challenges. We show that local people can collect forest condition data of comparable quality to trained scientists, at half the cost. We draw on our experience to propose how and where local REDD+ monitoring can be established.

To gather key information that will help to preserve its diversity in Benin and develop modern and well-adapted varieties that could meet both farmers' and consumers' needs, a participatory research appraisal survey was conducted in 15 villages randomly selected in the fonio production zone of Benin. Altogether 15 farmer-named landraces were recorded and further grouped into five morphotypes of which four belong to D. exilis and one to D. iburua. The number of landraces inventoried varied from one to five per village (three on average) and from one to three per household. Their distribution and extent are presented and their importance in terms of genetic resources conservation is discussed. Farmers' preferences for fonio varieties were assessed and eight preference criteria (earliness, culinary characteristics, ease of processing, productivity, facility of harvesting, grains size, storability, and drought tolerance) were identified and prioritised according to the gender. The traditional seed supply system and on-farm seed maintenance were investigated. Two plant species (Digitaria horizontalis Willd. and Digitaria longiflora (Retz.) Pers.) were reported by farmers as putative parents of cultivated fonio. Of these, only Digitaria longiflora has interesting agronomic traits (erect habit; stem long, big, strong and resistant to lodging; panicle long and rich in grains; large sized seeds) that are useful for the improvement of cultivated fonio. In the entire study area, the crop is under threat. Therefore, concerted efforts should be deployed to preserve its diversity and increase its use to combat food insecurity and malnutrition in Benin.

To mitigate such conflicts requires a firm understanding of their underlying patterns. This situation is epitomized in Pakistan, where carnivore populations have been greatly reduced, but where no research has investigated the conflict patterns of large carnivore guilds with humans. Focusing in and around Machiara National Park (MNP), Azad Jammu and Kashmir region, we conducted the first such scientific study in Pakistan. From January 2004 to May 2007, 148 people lost their livestock to four carnivore species. Leopard was responsible for the majority (90.6%) of the 363 livestock killed, mainly goats (57.3%) and sheep (27.8%). Information-theoretic evaluation of a candidate set of regression models found that leopard kills inside villages were significantly higher for areas without electricity, while leopard kills outside villages were higher for pastoralists with larger herds that were further from MNP, with no effect from several guarding strategies used. Temporal leopard attacks were significantly and positively related to temperature, but not to rainfall, for goat kills, but not for other livestock kills. While leopard kills caused the greatest overall financial loss (19.8%) amongst carnivores, which negatively affected local tolerance towards leopard, disease caused greater livestock losses (72.7%). To improve both large carnivore and local livelihood prospects around MNP and across rural Pakistan, conservation and development projects should install village electricity supplies and vaccinate livestock, while the cost-effectiveness of different conflict mitigation strategies should be trialed.

The lagoon was recently added to the list of water bodies with dead zones, raising concern for the people who depend on it for both sustenance and livelihood. The methodology includes in-depth interviews and surveys. Feedback was collected from 120 fishermen representing the different communities that fish the lagoon. Findings did include that fishermen indicated they have some knowledge about mangroves in general and specifically their value to fishing. However, they lack knowledge about the scientific information to manage these mangroves properly to derive the complete benefits that mangroves provide. With its importance to the livelihood of the fishermen and the traditional heritage of the Cape Coast (Ghana) community as a whole, Fosu Lagoon should be the object of more in-depth studies to help restore the fishery resources. This article provides baseline information for developing educational programs to educate the people about the economic, ecological value, and functions of mangroves. The report analyzes one of the obstacles - depletion of mangroves - leading to decline in fish resources in the lagoon. Based on the knowledge of the fishermen, the article provides some recommendations for better management of the lagoon to help reverse fish decline.

In general, robust livelihoods sustainability is found for a pro-poor section of rural households that participated in the forestry program. Amongst participants, however, especially the feminine units attain more favorable livelihoods outcome. Conversely, the program's eschewed households are behind sustainable livelihoods. It is therefore early need to expand the participatory forestry program for sustaining poor households' livelihood security in forest fringe areas of rural India. Â© The Author(s) 2012.

R.","year":2012,"title":"The ganges and the GAP: An assessment of efforts to clean a sacred river","dAbstract":"For centuries, the Ganges River in India has been the locus of sacred rites for the Hindus. The religious significance of the Ganges is physically manifested in ghats (stepped landings) that form the land-water interface. Besides serving as a site for religious bathing and cremation, the ghats are also tied to people's livelihoods and are an inseparable part of their daily lives. Today, the increasingly urbanized Ganges basin sustains more than 40 percent of India's population. At the same time, industrialization and the pressures of a growing population along its banks have contributed to alarming levels of pollution in the river. In 1985, the federal government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) with the primary objective of cleaning the river. However, characterized by centralized planning and control with little public participation, the GAP had limited impact. In 2011, the government launched yet another clean up program-the National Ganga River Basin Project-with support from the World Bank. In this paper, we take a closer look at the programs to highlight the tenuous relationship between the need for 'efficient' management of environmental problems and public participation. Can public participation fit into the technocratic model that is often adopted by environmental programs? What approaches to participation kindle authorship and empowerment among those who share a deep relationship with the river and the ghats? Can religious practices be accommodated within scientific frameworks of adaptive management and resilience? We argue that rethinking the relationship between pollution control programs and participation is crucial for any effort to clean the Ganges, restore its waterfront, and catalyze broader regeneration in the Ganges basin.

We conducted a camera-trapping survey in the Namdapha National Park, north-east India, conducted as part of a programme to evaluate carnivore and prey species abundance. Clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) was the only large carnivore detected by camera-trapping. Indirect evidences indicated the presence of the wild dog (Cuon alpinus) and leopard (Panthera pardus), however, there was no evidence of tigers (Panthera tigris), suggesting their possible extinction from the lower elevation forests. Of the major ungulate prey species, sambar (Cervus unicolor) and wild pig (Sus scrofa) were the only large prey detected, while the Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) was the only small prey species detected. Relative abundances of all species were appreciably lower than estimates from other tropical forests in south-east Asia. We suspect that illegal hunting may be the cause for the low carnivore and prey species abundance. An ongoing community-based conservation programme presents an opportunity to reduce local people's dependence on hunting by addressing their socio-economic needs and for using their skills and knowledge of the landscape for wildlife conservation. However, long-term wildlife monitoring is essential to assess the efficacy of the socio-economic interventions in bringing about wildlife recovery. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Its achievements were most pronounced in the Sal (Shorea robusta)-dominated tropical dry deciduous forests of eastern and south-eastern states of India. However, these forests, and consequently the marginal people dependent on them for their livelihood, have increasingly faced multidimensional challenges in the past 15 years in the context of sustainable forest management. An overall assessment of the management scenario for these community forests and formulation of some guidelines towards better management was carried out on the basis of intensive case studies in the Nayagram Forest Range of West Bengal, India. Socio-economic as well as ecological aspects of sustainable forestry were analysed on the basis of criteria and indicators of community-oriented forestry. Functioning of a forest protection community as a cohesive group was found to be the major determinant in achieving sustainability in forest management. Maintenance of such institutional sustainability is recommended for better conservation of these highly stressed forest lands.

Drawing insights from diverse sustainability issues, capabilities and performances of worldwide CBMM initiatives were examined in this paper. Higher numbers of CBMM initiatives were reported from South Asia and lesser from South America and Africa. Identification of the causes of degradation at a site and use-specific zonal replantations with respect to species associations were identified as major criteria of ecological sustainability. Regarding economic sustainability, transformation of potential uses of mangroves known by local communities into actual ones was found to be necessary. Proper disbursement of accrued benefits among community members irrespective of their socio-cultural status is also a major concern. Restructuring of CBMM institutions by ensuring participation of subsistence based users in decision-making and resource sharing have been identified as a prime determinant of institutional sustainability. However, limited number of studies on socio-political and institutional aspects as well as impacts of globalization induced socio-cultural transformations of communities on CBMM had been actually found.

With the advent of joint forest management concepts and commercial earning prospects from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), it was expected that forests would be best preserved by the villagers who depend on them for a substantial part of their livelihoods. However, in the case of the Ranibundh block in the Bankura district, it was observed that the predominance of private agencies in marketing channels of NTFPs, together with risk of eviction, loss of customary right to access forest resources, low employment prospects, and lack of training about proper management of NTFPs have led to the failure in motivating the forest dwellers to prevent degradation of forest resources. It is suggested that government agencies, producer institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other strong institutional entities can promote forest preservation when complemented by the granting of forest rights to rural people, the extension of training facilities, and alternative employment prospects.

Combining photo-identification data collected between September 2007 and 2009 with mark-recapture and Pollock's robust design models, we assessed abundance within seasons and survival and temporary emigration rates of dolphins between seasons. We also reanalyzed a previous data set collected during 1989-1991, and Cormack-Jolly-Seber models were applied to estimate survival rates for each of the study periods. The abundance of marked \"cooperative\" dolphins varied between seasons from 18 (CI: 17-24) to 21 (CI: 20-24). The total abundance varied from 59 in the winter of 2008 (CI: 49-72) to 50 in the autumn of 2009 (CI: 40-62).

The emigration probability was low (0.031; CI: 0.011-0.084) and different capture probabilities between the \"cooperative\" and \"noncooperative\" dolphins indicated a degree of behavioral segregation.

Traditional knowledge is often discussed by resource management agencies as a source of information to be incorporated into management practice; in this paper we go further and explore traditional knowledge as an arena of dialogue between resource managers and harvesters.

Deforestation and annual burning are causing significant land degradation problems in the area around Bandawe, northern Malawi. We mapped evidence of soil erosion and remaining areas of woodland. Gully erosion was common and primarily associated with heavily utilised footpaths. Areas between gullies showed signs of significant soil movement. Remnant patches of native woodland existed but were small, degraded and isolated. We interviewed local households to understand local awareness and impacts of land-degradation, its perceived cause and preferred methods for restoration. All households were aware of the presence of gullies and reported associated problems of flood damage. Most households believed erosion was a result of deforestation. Burning practices were seen to have exacerbated erosion problems. Changing fire management practice was not seen as realistic as it risked reducing the productivity of grasses and fires were perceived to be too difficult to control. Tree planting was the community's preferred approach to tackling erosion. Their focus was on planting exotic fruit and timber trees around houses and they often requested that such work be done by volunteers. Such attitudes may have been influenced by recent extension work and a desire to secure ownership of utilisable resource. Ecologists in the miombo zone should focus on improving fire management practices and involving communities in creating diverse secondary woodlands that provide a range of goods and services.

E.; Beanjara, N.; Tregenza, T.","year":2009,"title":"A socio-economic perspective on gear-based management in an artisanal fishery in south-west Madagascar","dAbstract":"Artisanal fisheries are important socially, nutritionally and economically. Poverty is common in communities dependent on such fisheries, making sustainable management difficult. Poverty based on material style of life (MSL) was assessed, livelihoods surveyed and the relationship between these factors and fishery data collected using a fish landing study were examined. Species richness, diversity, size and mean trophic level of catches were determined for six fishing gears in an artisanal fishery in south-west Madagascar. There was little livelihood diversification and respondents were highly dependent on the fishery. No relationship was found between poverty and gear use. This suggests that poverty does not have a major impact on the nature of the fishery; however, this study was dominated by poor households, so it remains possible that communities with more variation in wealth might show differences in fishing methods according to this parameter. The fishery was heavily exploited with a predominance of small fish in the catches. Beach seines caught some of the smallest fish, overlapped in selectivity with gill nets and also had the highest catch per fishers. Thus, a reduction in the number of beach seines could help reduce the catch of small fish and the overlap in selectivity among gears.

Under the new economics of labor migration (NELM) framework, it is hypothesized that smallholder farm households invest remittance income in their land either to increase crop production or to transition to cattle ranching. We test this hypothesis by developing a combination of multivariate logistic, Poisson and beta regression techniques using Latin American Migration Project data to determine how agricultural land use change compared among migrant and non-migrant households in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Results indicate that a rise in months spent abroad and remittances returned do not translate into a higher percentage of farm sales, intensification or transition to cattle ranching - counter to NELM. However, farmers are investing remittances to increase row crop and pasture land holdings. These findings suggest remittance investments in quantitative increase rather than qualitative change in land use practices. Given the expansive land demands supporting low intensity smallholder agriculture and cattle, and the land degradation cattle precipitate particularly, the trend does not augur well for the sustainability of rural landscapes increasingly transformed by international remittances. Appropriate policies to champion coupled human-land system sustainability in Central America might usefully consider viable land use alternatives to remittance investments dedicated to crop and pasture expansion.

Payments for ecosystem services (PES) implicitly recognize the unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of maintaining ES, through monetary compensation from winners' to losers'. Some research into PES has examined how such schemes affect poverty, while other literature addresses trade-offs between different ES. However, much evolving ES literature adopts an aggregated perspective of humans and their well-being, which can disregard critical issues for poverty alleviation. This paper identifies four issues with examples from coastal ES in developing countries. First, different groups derive well-being benefits from different ES, creating winners and losers as ES, change. Second, dynamic mechanisms of access determine who can benefit. Third, individuals' contexts and needs determine how ES contribute to well-being. Fourth, aggregated analyses may neglect crucial poverty alleviation mechanisms such as cash-based livelihoods. To inform the development of ES interventions that contribute to poverty alleviation, disaggregated analysis is needed that focuses on who derives which benefits from ecosystems, and how such benefits contribute to the well-being of the poor. These issues present challenges in data availability and selection of how and at which scales to disaggregate. Disaggregation can be applied spatially, but should also include social groupings, such as gender, age and ethnicity, and is most important where inequality is greatest. Existing tools, such as stakeholder analysis and equity weights, can improve the relevance of ES research to poverty alleviation.

Fishers' adaptive responses to these pressures, such as exiting from a fishery to pursue alternative livelihoods, determine their own vulnerability, as well as the potential for reducing fishing effort and sustaining fisheries. The willingness and ability to make particular adaptations in response to change, such as exiting from a declining fishery, is influenced by economic, cultural and institutional factors operating at scales from individual fishers to national economies. Previous studies of exit from fisheries at single or few sites, offer limited insight into the relative importance of individual and larger-scale social and economic factors. We asked 599 fishers how they would respond to hypothetical scenarios of catch declines in 28 sites in five western Indian Ocean countries. We investigated how socioeconomic variables at the individual-, household- and site-scale affected whether they would exit fisheries. Site-level factors had the greatest influence on readiness to exit, but these relationships were contrary to common predictions. Specifically, higher levels of infrastructure development and economic vitality - expected to promote exit from fisheries - were associated with less readiness to exit. This may be due to site level histories of exit from fisheries, greater specialisation of fishing households, or higher rewards from fishing in more economically developed sites due to technology, market access, catch value and government subsidies. At the individual and household scale, fishers from households with more livelihood activities, and fishers with lower catch value were more willing to exit. These results demonstrate empirically how adaptive responses to change are influenced by factors at multiple scales, and highlight the importance of understanding natural resource-based livelihoods in the context of the wider economy and society.

Unless agroforestry landscapes are productive, however, farmers will not maintain or enhance the range and quality of tree species in them, and both income opportunities and biodiversity will be lost. Productivity depends on both tree species diversity and genetic (intra-specific) variation, but research on the latter has until recently not received the recognition it deserves. Worse, when knowledge on tree genetic variation in agroforestry systems has become available, it has not generally been linked in any systematic way with management, indicating a disjunction between research and field-level practice. In this essay, we attempt to bridge this gap by considering three questions: why is genetic diversity important in tree species? What is our current state of knowledge about intra-specific variation in trees in agroforestry systems? And, finally, what practical interventions are possible to support the conservation of this diversity in agricultural landscapes, while enhancing farmers' livelihoods? A wide genetic base in agroforestry trees is essential to prevent inbreeding depression and allow adaptation to changing environmental conditions and to altering markets for tree products. Recent evidence shows, however, that many species are subject to poor germplasm collection practice, occur at low densities in farmland, and are found in highly aggregated distributions, all of which observations raise concerns about productivity and sustainability. A range of germplasm-access based interventions is necessary to improve current management, including the enhancement of community seed- and seedling-exchange networks, and the development of locally based tree domestication activities. Equally necessary, but more difficult to address, is the development of markets that support genetic diversity in tropical tree species; we discuss approaches by which this may be undertaken.

This paper reviews the impact of grazing on these parameters and their interactions, identifying those practices that best meet governments' strategic goals. The recent focus of research on livestock grazing and biodiversity has been on reducing grazing intensity on hill and upland areas. Although this produces rapid increases in sward height and herbage mass, changes in structural diversity and plant species are slower, with no appreciable short-term increases in biodiversity so that environmental policies that simply involve reductions in numbers of livestock may not result in increased biodiversity. Furthermore, upland areas rely heavily on nutrient inputs to pastures so that withdrawal of these inputs can threaten food security. Differences in grazing patterns among breeds increase our ability to manage biodiversity if they are matched appropriately to different conservation grazing goals. Lowland grassland systems differ from upland pastures in that additional nutrients in the form of organic and inorganic fertilisers are more frequently applied to lowland pastures. Appropriate management of these nutrient applications is required, to reduce the associated environmental impact. New slurry-spreading techniques and technologies (e.g. the trailing shoe) help reduce nutrient losses but high nitrogen losses from urine deposition remain a key issue for lowland grassland systems. Nitrification inhibitors have the greatest potential to successfully tackle this problem. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are lower from indoor-based systems that use concentrates to shorten finishing periods. The challenge is to achieve the same level of performance from grass-based systems. Research has shown potential solutions through the use of forages containing condensed tannins or establishing swards with a high proportion of clover and high-sugar grasses. Relative to feeding conserved forage or concentrates, grazing fresh grass not only reduces GHG emissions but also enhances the fatty acid composition of meat in terms of consumer health. It is possible to influence biodiversity, nutrient utilisation, GHG emissions and the nutritional quality of meat in grass-based systems, but each of these parameters is intrinsically linked and should not be considered in isolation. Interactions between these parameters must be considered carefully when policies are being developed, in order to ensure that strategies designed to achieve positive gains in one category do not lead to a negative impact in another. Some win-win outcomes are identified. Â© 2011 The Animal Consortium.","journal":"Animal","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

We introduce a framework that uses information from different sources to identify vulnerability and to support the design of conservation responses.

This is due largely to the fact that the Earth is made up of open, coupled, complex, interactive and non-linear dynamic systems that are inherently unpredictable. Uncertainties over interactions and feedbacks between natural and human drivers of environmental change (operating at different spatial and temporal scales) can compound intrinsic intractable difficulties faced by plural societies aiming at sustainable management of ecosystems. Social-Ecological Systems (SES) theory addresses these strongly coupled and complex characteristics of social and ecological systems. It can provide a useful framework for articulating contrasting drivers and pressures on ecosystems and associated service provision, spanning different temporalities and provenances. Here, system vulnerabilities (defined as exposure to threats affecting ability of an SES to cope in delivering relevant functions), can arise from both endogenous and exogenous factors across multiple time-scales. Vulnerabilities may also take contrasting forms, ranging from transient shocks or disruptions, through to chronic or enduring pressures. Recognising these diverse conditions, four distinct dynamic properties emerge (resilience, stability, durability and robustness), under which it is possible to maintain system function and, hence, achieve sustainability.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Day, M.","year":2010,"title":"Challenges to sustainability in the Caribbean karst","dAbstract":"Karst landscapes in the Caribbean cover nearly 130,000km2, more than half the total land area of the region. Approximately 90% of the karst is on the Greater Antilles, with other significant areas in the Bahamas, Anguilla, Antigua, the Cayman Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Netherlands Antilles. There is considerable heterogeneity, but the Caribbean contains many \"classic\" karst landscapes, including cockpits, towers, dry valleys, dolines (sinkholes), blue holes and caves. The karst has played an important role in Caribbean history, as a focus of resistance to colonial power, and as a basis for subsistence agriculture following emancipation and independence, increasingly incorporating commercial agriculture, urbanization and industrial activities, and tourism. Karst landscape provides a critical physical backdrop for many of the Caribbean's environmental, agricultural, economic and cultural issues, and its sustainability is critical to regional wellbeing. The Caribbean karstlands are challenging to human habitation, since they possess a broad array of natural hazards, such as drought and flooding, but they are also inherently fragile, at risk of degradation and vulnerable to environmental change. Despite this vulnerability to environmental change, under rational management regimes there is no inherent reason why human use should not be sustainable in the long term. Human impacts, however, have been longterm and severe, particularly through destruction of natural vegetation, contamination of water supplies, urbanization and quarrying. The Caribbean karst continues to play important roles locally, nationally and regionally in water supply, mining and quarrying, agriculture, tourism and conservation, all of which represent specific and collective challenges to sustainability of the karst environment. Additionally, sustainability is threatened by the consequences of anthropogenic climatic change, which is predicted to lead to increasing air and water temperatures, rising sea levels and changing weather patterns, including decreasing precipitation totals, and the increasing frequency of extreme events, such as droughts and hurricanes, the effects of all of which will be magnified in the karst, particularly with respect to karst hydrology. Disruption of the karst hydrological cycle may lead to increasing aridity and desertification, with concomitant impacts on ecology and potential land use. Increasing population and economic development will further exacerbate human impacts on the karst landscapes. Climate change and other human impacts will increasingly threaten already at-risk and vulnerable ecosystems and human communities, necessitating integration of climate change parameters and the adoption of appropriate risk management measures. The severity of these impacts may be reduced by appropriate land management and land use planning, which are necessary ingredients for long-term sustainability.","journal":"Geologia Croatica","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The management needs that can be met with marine protected areas fall into corresponding categories. First, fully protected (that is, no-take) reserves - parks - offer benchmarks and protect ecosystem integrity while encouraging research, education, and aesthetic appreciation of nature. Second, by allowing focused local control of human impacts, marine protected areas can be used to focus more intense local management designed to increase yield and allow research to help define sustainability and protect against uncertainty by using carefully managed fisheries as a research tool. We have been gambling with the future by establishing a poor balance between short-term profit and long-term risks. The absence of meaningful, fully protected reserves has produced a situation in which there are virtually no areas north of the Antarctic in the world's oceans that have exploitable resources where scientists can study natural marine systems. In most areas the higher-order predators and many other important species have been virtually eliminated; many benthic habitats have been much changed by fishing activities. Without solid data documenting changes through time, the relative merits of various causes and effects that operate in complex ecological systems can always be argued. Without natural systems important questions cannot be studied - for example, how the ecosystem roles of various species can be assessed, how they can be managed in a sustainable manner, and how we can evaluate resilience or relative rates of recovery. Networks of fully-protected reserves could facilitate research into such questions, contribute to the recovery of many coastal systems, and enable society to enrich its existence by observing species that should be part of its heritage (Murray et al., 1999). The use of marine protected areas as fishing refugia has met strong resistance by fishers and many managers, and it is misunderstood by many conservation biologists because different proponents have different, usually simplistic, visions. It is important to spell out the objectives of each proposed example. Our essential habitat perspective emphasizes that each situation depends on specific life-history parameters and emphasizes critical thresholds in population dynamics, including density and behavior for fertilization, transport processes, settlement, survivorship, and growth to maturity. These are extremely difficult problems, and we cannot expect simplistic solutions to be effective. The only basis for optimism is that most of the seriously affected species are not yet extinct, and we still have a little time to establish permanent fully protected reserves to allow mankind to appreciate its rich but much depleted biological heritage. At least in some systems recovery can be measured over short time scales (<10 yrs), whereas others are much slower. Society as a whole is the ultimate stakeholder, not only the commercial and sports fishing industries that so dominate the public arena. Society will have to play a more active role if these species and habitats are to be saved.","journal":"Bulletin of Marine Science","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The interviews were performed using subjective and objective questions. No strong association between age or time of residence and conservationist ideas was observed. Similarly, these ideas are independent from the level of formal education or gender. The respondents have positive attitudes in relation to the environment and understand its importance; there is a powerful link between them and the environment they live in. In spite of the positive attitudes shown by some villagers, there is a lack of essential information about the importance of the environment and its management.

Greater Rheas are threatened South American birds; habitat loss, predation and hunting are the main factors responsible for population declines. Populations of this species are now held in captivity for future conservation programmes. Meanwhile, for a conservation program to succeed, it is necessary that the human community close to an in-situ conservation project be involved. Thus, the perceptions of the human community must be evaluated and incorporated into the conservation activities planned. It is expected that the human communities that are inserted in the environment where the endangered species occur will give more importance to its conservation than human communities that live far from the problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether perceptions of rural and urban communities about Greater Rheas are different due to experience and proximity with the problem. The study was conducted in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Buriti (rural community; wild Greater Rheas occur in this area) and at the BH Zoo (urban community), both in Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil. One-hundred and thirty-five questionnaires were given to people in both areas. Rural people were better able to recognize Greater Rheas than the urban community. Peoples knowledge about the Greater Rheas' risk of extinction differed in some aspects between rural communities and urban communities, but both communities agreed that the local extinction of Greater Rheas would bring ecological problems. Rural communities related local environmental problems (e.g., silvicultural activities) as one of the main reasons for Greater Rheas' declining populations while urban communities related more general reasons (e.g., trafficking and hunting). Environmental education programs should be implemented in both areas to maximize conservation actions.","journal":"O conhecimento das pessoas acerca de uma espÃ©cie de ave ameaÃ§ada de extinÃ§Ã£o difere entre comunidades rurais e urbanas?

In parts of the world with a history of armed conflict, the chances of such an approach being successfully adopted might seem remote. One such area is the Maputo Elephant Reserve in southern Mozambique. The aim was to improve understanding of the local people's use of natural resources and perceptions of the Reserve's impact. Interviews and questionnaires distributed in four different villages were used to estimate the relative value of these resources in relation to the attitude of the local people towards the Reserve. The people gave a relative value rank for each specific use of each plant, animal and fish resource. On average 60% of the households exploited more than two different resource categories. The plant resources of the reserve were used by 71% of the households and were valued more highly than animal and fish resources. Plants were used for many purposes; construction material, fuelwood and fruits had the highest relative values. Antelopes, hippopotamus and elephants were valued highest amongst a range of animal species which were hunted by 21% of households. Amongst uses of animals, consumption, use of the skins and commercial sale of the meat were especially important. When asked if they liked the Reserve, 88% of respondents answered positively. The attitude towards the Reserve was correlated with crop damage experiences; people with crop damage caused by elephants, hippos or bushpigs, were more negative. Attitude of respondents was inversely related to the number of species invading their agricultural fields. Resource use intensity, use purpose, resource value and attitude were different amongst sites and dependent on site-specific circumstances, different management strategies could be necessary for the four sites.

It consisted of the release of three natural enemies, two weevil species and one moth, that feed exclusively on water hyacinth. In 1999, a survey of 365 men and women from 192 households in 24 villages in the target area, using participatory and quantitative methods, revealed that water hyacinth, although not eliminated, was perceived by the villagers as having been reduced from a serious pest to one of minor or moderate importance. According to their estimates of the impacts they perceived, at the peak of the infestation water hyacinth had reduced the yearly income of this population of about 200 000 by approximately US$84 million. Lost revenues for men were mostly in fishing, while women experienced lost revenues in trade, primarily food crops and fish. The reduction of water hyacinth cover through biological control was credited with an increase in income of US$30.5 million per year. The total cost of the control program is estimated at a present value of US$2.09 million. Assuming the benefits are to stay constant over the next 20 years, a most conservative assumption, the accumulated present value would be US$260 million, yielding a respectable benefit cost ratio of 124:1. This ratio is calculated for direct economic effects on the people of Southern Benin only, and does not take into account indirect benefits or the benefits of the project to other countries were the biological control agents were successfully introduced.

A.","year":2009,"title":"A new regime for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity and genetic resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction","dAbstract":"Life on earth, the climate, the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat are to a large degree dependent on the health of the oceans and its biodiversity, which supports the global ecosystem. Ocean ecosystems provide essential services, food security and livelihoods to human beings all over the world. Yet, the oceans are currently or potentially threatened by human activities and their consequences, including: overfishing, destructive fishing practices, climate change, pollution from many sources, ocean acidification, habitat destruction, the spread of alien species, mineral exploration and exploitation, ocean dumping, underwater noise, marine debris, carbon sequestration, pipelines and cables, tourism, bioprospecting and marine scientific research. If we are to continue to benefit from the resources and services provided by the oceans, we must take urgent action to counter these threats. Some problems are already being addressed in various international instruments, most of which apply beyond national jurisdiction. However, because of the seriousness of the threats to marine ecosystems, States are considering whether existing measures are sufficient. Furthermore, with the recognition of the need to take an integrated, ecosystem approach to ocean management, some States are calling for an implementing agreement to the UN Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) to address both the conservation and the sustainable use of marine biological resources beyond national jurisdiction. This paper examines the legal background and urges States to elaborate an implementing agreement to the LOSC to create a new regime for marine biodiversity and genetic resources beyond national jurisdiction.

The sustainable extraction of NTFPs is increasingly regarded as an important part for forest conservation strategies. This paper provides an overview and comparison of existing statutory legislation with respect to the extraction and trade of NTFPs in four Andean countries and discusses its adequacy with respect to ensuring legal and sustainable extraction and trade of NTFPs. The related legal framework surrounding indigenous peoples' rights, traditional knowledge and access to genetic resources is also reviewed. Forest laws are primarily concerned with the regulation of timber. Hence, legal and administrative frameworks to regulate the extraction and trade of NTFPs are fragmented and ambiguous. By providing an overview over the existing legal situation, this paper seeks to inform and open debates about ways to improve the regulation of the extraction and trade of NTFPs in the region.

However, much of the work in this field has focused mainly on regulations. This paper identifies other factors, i.e., normative, cultural-cognitive, and psychological, affecting institutional performance, management, and feedback. Using the case of Zanzibar, Tanzania, it is illustrated through the analysis of the Bwana Dikos, which are public officials placed in villages and landing sites for monitoring purposes, how a well-designed organization and clear regulations might be necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve successful management. Through triangulation of interviews, document reviews, and participant observation, it was found that four dilemmas, i.e., kinship, loyalty, poverty, and control, interfered with institutional performance, thereby decreasing efficiency. Poverty was the main driving factor explaining the Bwana Diko's performance, but loyalty elements crosscut the other dilemmas as well. Psychological aspects were important and deserve further research. The control dilemma refers to the institutional mismatches in spatial and cognitive terms. Lack of institutional replication at the proper spatial scales negatively affected the resilience of the whole institutional setting. Furthermore, the importance of embeddedness, coproduction, and windows of opportunities to improve the institutional setting and the poverty condition of the Bwana Diko is discussed. This paper shows that a broad view of institutions is urgently needed to understand the complexity of social-ecological systems, achieve sustainability goals, tackle development, and meet our fundamental challenge, poverty alleviation.

It offers a brief historical review of public policies and programs for Amazonia, and critically analyzes their conflicting aspects. Local environmental governance (LEG) is proposed as a conceptual framework and a participatory forest management strategy for dealing with the forest destruction. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a qualitative-based study which provides a systemic analysis of the process of occupation and the key public policies for Amazonia from over the last decades, particularly during the coup d'Ã©tat regime. Based on a literature review and official documents, descriptive data are produced which helped in understanding the political phases of the Brazilian government administrations. Findings: The study identified some participatory-based, decentralized models of forest management and existing forest regulatory frameworks which can serve as an illustrative sketchy arrangement on how local environmental governance can become operative and serviceable for a sustainable balance between the use of natural resources, conservation and regional planning. These findings can help future investigations on governance models. The research also shows how the Brazilian government has perceived Amazonia throughout the decades and how this perception influenced the implementation of development and settlement policies for the region. Originality/value: The main focus of this article is the debate on the concept of local environmental governance (LEG) as a tool for empowering the local communities through the decentralization of decision making as well as the attempt to find implemented normative and institutional structures within the Amazonian context which can translate aspects of LEG.

The objective is to assess how the establishment or destruction of the Park distributes benefits and costs among different stakeholders. A household survey of local communities was undertaken to provide social, economic and ecological data. The paper determines the costs and benefits of three management options: (1) The experimental park scenario corresponds to the base case where some level of protection is achieved, but fisheries eventually collapse; (2) the ghost park scenario assumes that all timber and fish are harvested, destroying the area; (3) the dream park scenario only allows subsistence activities, recreation, education and research. At a 10% discount rate, the dream park has the highest net present value (US $11.9 million). This compares with US $10.0 million for the ghost park and US $9.8 million for the experimental park. Although the dream park scenario has the highest net present value, it exceeds that of the ghost park by less than US $2.0 million. However, protection scenarios allocate the bulk of the Park's benefits to local communities. The dream park confers three times more benefit value to villagers compared with the ghost park. Local communities, whose traditional livelihoods depend on the sustainable use of the Park, stand to loose most; commercial loggers and fishing fleets, as well as the Armed Forces, stand to gain most from the wanton exploitation of timber and marine resources.

Data on biological and ecological aspects of economically important brachyuran crustaceans have been obtained from semi-structured interviews and in loco observations conducted from September 2007 to December 2009. A total of 57 fishermen of both genders, aged between 10 and 78 years have been interviewed (individually or collectively) in different contexts; interviewees were asked about aspects such as external morphology, life cycle, trophic ecology, and spatial and temporal distribution of the major economically important brachyuran crustaceans in the region. Seven fishing communities were visited: Siribinha, SÃ­tio do Conde, PoÃ§as, Ilha das Ostras, CobÃ³, Buri and Sempre Viva. Data were analyzed by comparing the information provided by participants with those from the specialized academic literature. The results show that artisanal fishermen have a wide ranging and well-grounded knowledge on the ecological and biological aspects of crustaceans. Crab gatherers of Conde know about growth and reproductive behavior of the animals they interact with, especially with regard to the three major biological aspects: \"molt\", \"walking dance\" and \"spawning\".

Escalating drought, deforestation, capitation, irresponsible land use, and pollution are direct consequences that demand an integrated management scheme. Such a scheme depends on the supporting capacity and resiliency of aquatic ecosystems, being aimed at the conservation of local resources quality and availability. UNESCO is currently employing hydrologic programs in different regions of the world to understand the existing interrelationships between ecology and hydrology. The main goal of ecohydrologic programs is to encourage the collaboration between scientists and political decision-makers in searching for sustainable operational processes, and dissemination of novel ways of thinking and acting which mind preserving biological integrity. The mechanistic model is not sustainable as it does not take into consideration the biological processes driving nutrient cycles within ecosystems. The general policy of ecohydrology is systemic and integrated, aiming at understanding the ecological, climatic and human-induced processes that affect aquatic ecosystems. The irresponsible use of natural resources is bringing drought, which is bound to handicap the production of vital resources for sustaining human population, as is already happening in some parts of the world. On our contemporary attitude depends life quality in the future. An integrated management of aquatic ecosystems will only become possible from changing current paradigms, from multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinary action, and based on the relentless search for sustainable technology and practices.","journal":"A visÃ£o integrada da ecohidrologia para o manejo sustentÃ¡vel dos ecossistemas aquÃ¡ticos","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Lack of income generating activities and economic choices has forced these communities into the exploitation of forest resources. The introduction of Joint Forest Management activities in the last decade has provided the employment opportunities and income generation to alleviate poverty in the area to some extent.

{"author":"DeFoliart, G.

The great diversity of habitats of insect species that serve as traditional foods presents an almost endless diversity of situations in which recognition and enlightened management of the food insect resource can result not only in better human nutrition but simultaneously aid in maintaining diversity of habitats for other forms of life. Approaches include: 1) Enhancing forest conservation and management by acting on the desire of local populations for protection of traditional insect foods (i.e., caterpillars in Zambia and Zaire); 2) Reducing poaching in parks and wildlife preserves by allowing sustainable use of the food insect resources by the local people (i.e., caterpillars in Malawi); 3) Reducing pesticide use by developing more efficient methods of harvesting pest species that are traditional foods (i.e., grasshoppers); 4) Increasing environmental and economic efficiency by developing dual product systems (i.e., silks and silk moth larvae/pupae, honey and honey bee brood); 5) Reducing organic pollution by recycling agricultural and forestry wastes into high-quality food or animal feedstuffs (i.e., fly larvae, palm weevils). Other relevant considerations are that some edible insect species enhance their local environment in various ways (i.e., leafcutter ants in S. America) or create additional diversity of species within the habitat (i.e., termites in Africa). Some, as shown in studies with crickets exhibit considerably higher food conversion efficiency than beef cattle when fed diets of similar quality. Finally, there is need for research on industrial scale mass-production of edible insects, for increased recognition of the nutritional and environmental importance of insects by national governments, and for increased involvement of Western media and academia in dispelling unfounded cultural biases in the Western World toward insects as food.","journal":"Ecology of Food Nutrition","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

K.; Pareeth, S.","year":2010,"title":"Interactions between protected areas and their surroundings in human-dominated tropical landscapes","dAbstract":"Protected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a \"zone of interaction\" (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs - Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole - using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha's ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.

K.","year":2009,"title":"The realities of community based natural resource management and biodiversity conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa","dAbstract":"This is an historic overview of conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa from pre-colonial times through the present. It demonstrates that Africans practiced conservation that was ignored by the colonial powers. The colonial market economy combined with the human and livestock population explosion of the 21st century are the major factors contributing to the demise of wildlife and critical habitat. Unique insight is provided into the economics of a representative safari company, something that has not been readily available to Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) practitioners. Modern attempts at sharing benefits from conservation with rural communities will fail due to the low rural resource to population ratio regardless of the model, combined with the uneven distribution of profits from safari hunting that drives most CBNRM programs, unless these ratios are changed. Low household incomes from CBNRM are unlikely to change attitudes of rural dwellers towards Western approaches to conservation. Communities must sustainably manage their natural areas as \"green factories\" for the multitude of natural resources they contain as a means of maximizing employment and thus household incomes, as well as meeting the often overlooked socio-cultural ties to wildlife and other natural resources, which may be as important as direct material benefits in assuring conservation of wildlife and its habitat. For CBNRM to be successful in the long-term, full devolution of ownership over land and natural resources must take place. In addition, as a means of relieving pressure on the rural resource base, this will require an urbanization process that creates a middleclass, as opposed to the current slums that form the majority of Africa's cities, through industrialization that transforms the unique natural resources of the subcontinent (e.g., strategic minerals, petroleum, wildlife, hardwoods, fisheries, wild medicines, agricultural products, etc.) in Africa.

Standard approaches to participatory conservation begin with need-based assessments that identify human-induced ecological threats and livelihood deficiencies, but this focus on \"threats\" and \"needs\" tends to reinforce perceptions of rural people as predatory, poor and dependent. We examine the theoretical, conceptual, and methodological application of an alternative, \"assets-based\" approach to participatory conservation and the co-management of natural resources in areas of high cultural and biological diversity. As a case study, we report on the implementation of an asset-mapping activity applied in the buffer zone of the Cordillera Azul National Park in north-central Peru. Data were collected by community facilitators in 53 communities within the park's buffer zone. These data encompass local knowledge systems, community visions for the future, and innovative livelihood strategies compatible with conservation goals. By focusing on these social assets, this approach demonstrates the ways in which positive, pre-existing cultural characteristics may be used to plan and guide the management of a protected area. We describe how this approach has helped to empower local communities and to improve dialogue and transparency between disparate stakeholders.

This paper aims to understand the role played by the consumption of wild food plants in the livelihood of rural populations. Two methods of evaluation are used to estimate the value of the wild food plants consumed by Pwo Karen people living in the Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand. The first calculates the time needed to gather the wild food plants (14.63 days/year per household), and the second uses the prices of commercial substitutes in the market to estimate the number of days household members would have to engage in paid work if they switched to commercial food crops (143 days/year). The paper concludes that consuming wild food plants is an efficient method of subsistence that should be encouraged. If it is not encouraged, economic growth could lead people to squander additional cash incomes on higher-status commercial food crops rather than spend it on productive investment.

{"author":"Delang, C.

The article argues that the Pwo Karen have two methods of forest classification, closely related to their swidden farming practices. The first is used for forest land that has been, or can be, swiddened, and classifies forest types according to growth conditions. The second system is used for land that is not suitable for cultivation and looks at soil properties and slope. The article estimates the relative importance of each forest type in what concerns the collection of wild food plants. A total of 134 wild food plant species were recorded in December 2004. They account for some 80-90% of the amount of edible plants consumed by the Pwo Karen, and have a base value of Baht 11,505 per year, comparable to the cash incomes of many households. The article argues that the Pwo Karen reliance on NTFPs has influenced their land-use and forest management practices. However, by restricting the length of the fallow period, the Thai government has caused ecological changes that are challenging the ability of the Karen to remain subsistence oriented. By ignoring shifting cultivators' dependence on such products, the involvement of governments in forest management, especially through restrictions imposed on swidden farming practices, is likely to have a considerable impact on the livelihood strategies of these communities.

First, we present the Bio-natur project of MST (Movimento Sem Terra/Landless People's Movement), the largest rural movement in Latin America. The project explicitly attempts to include lay/traditional knowledge into the processes of defining and protecting a regulatory space for \"Creole seeds\". Second, we describe the formally open and inclusive environmental management of polluted sediments during harbour dredging in Norway. In both cases the actors are confronted with difficult problems bound by contradictory constraints of the institutional and cultural contexts.

From time immemorial, the marshes were a region in which a community of people made their homes, derived their livelihood, and preserved a particular local culture closely linked to the marshes. As recently as 1990, these marshes constituted healthy, ecologically rich wetlands. After the Marsh Arabs joined in the revolt against Saddam Hussein in 1991, he undertook to drain the marshes in order to bring these highly independent people under his control. The former marshes became barren, salt-encrusted land, with the Marsh Arabs living as refugees in Iran and Iraq. No attempt was made to develop the diverted water or drained lands. The destruction was an ecocide adopted as a means of genocide against the Marsh Arabs. After the fall of Saddam, the Marsh Arabs returned to the land and restored the flow of water by simply breaching the dams, dikes, and canalswith little or no attention to water quality concerns. Today about 50 of the marshes have been restored.

{"author":"Denny, P.","year":2001,"title":"Research, capacity-building and empowerment for sustainable management of African wetland ecosystems","dAbstract":"African wetlands have important functions and values in terms of the water cycle, water quality management and biodiversity conservation. Especially relevant is their importance in food security, the provision of tradable products, and cultural and aesthetic values for local riparian communities. In Africa, knowledge of the processes, functions and values of wetlands is slim: Indeed, in many regions, wetland inventories are yet to be produced. A research strategy is proposed to address some of these issues recommending an intrinsically linked, two-pronged approach: i.e. (i) studies for inventories, assessment and monitoring of wetlands and (ii) research into processes, structure and functioning of wetland ecosystems. The former has an immediate urgency whilst the latter has a long-term perspective. It is argued that 'curiosity-driven', (basic) research should go hand-in-hand with problem-orientated (applied) studies. Basic research is essential for a nation's scientific and technical empowerment and development. Priority topics include studies on biological diversity and integrated studies on wetlands and water resources (including water quality and the functions and values of wetland buffers). There is clear evidence of a shortage of expertise from within Africa for these topics and the reasons are discussed. Amongst others, blame is directed towards aid strategies from the industrial 'North' and individual research programmes by 'Northern' scientists in Africa. However, commitment in Africa to the actual process of scientific research is also wanting. Overall, the North have failed to stimulate a critical mass for research whilst the South suffer from a lack of momentum and from chronic under-investment. A research, training and capacity-building scheme is presented as a viable option for ameliorating the dearth of wetland resource professionals in Africa in which partnerships and networking of institutes from the North and South is encouraged.","journal":"Hydrobiologia","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This paper aims to provide a deeper insight into the livelihoods of inhabitants of the Tano Offin Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA) in Ghana's high forest zone and how these are becoming under greater pressure. It assesses the governance implications of the implementation of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) under the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan of the European Union and projects within the framework of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation plus (REDD. +), with a focus on the need for social safeguards. The study shows that the inhabitants of admitted villages in GSBAs already have few legal livelihood options due to restricted access to the forest, which results in competing claims among resource users and with forest managers. Stronger law enforcement resulting from the FLEGT/VPA to combat illegal logging and the Ghana Forestry Commission's consideration to include GSBAs in its REDD+. programme is likely to further restrict inhabitants' access to forest resources, with the result being increasing competition for scarce resources. Social safeguards therefore need serious consideration when implementing new forest governance regimes. The authors argue that the politics of protected areas need to reconsider the position of the inhabitants by creating space to build a livelihood, paying them for taking care of nature or relocating them beyond the protected area. This might involve hard choices. What eventually is needed is a change towards interactive governance and adaptive co-management.

The case study of Himachal Pradesh shows that, for adaptation measures to be realistic, the needs of different stakeholders with an interest in forest products and services must be addressed. It is recommended that existing programmes to resolve conflicts between different stakeholders be strengthened. Diversification of occupation structures has also been identified as an important strategy to reduce the vulnerability of forest-dependent communities.

The importance of these are reflected by serious inadequate animal protein production throughout Asia, where available supplies cannot match current and projected human requirements up to 2050. Among the ruminant production systems, integrated tree crops-ruminant production systems are grossly underestimated and merit emphasis and expansion. As an example, integrated oil palm- based system is an important pathway for integration with ruminants (buffaloes, cattle, goats and sheep), and provides the entry point for development. The importance and benefits of integrated systems are discussed, involving animals with annual and perennial tree crops, integration with aquaculture, the significance of crop-animal interactions, stratification of the systems, production options, improved use of forages and legumes, potential for enhanced productivity, implications for improved livelihoods of the rural poor and the stability of farm households. The advances in research and development in South East Asia highlight demonstrable increased productivity from animals and meat offtakes, value addition to the oil palm crop, sustainable development, and distinct economic impacts. The results from 12 out of a total of 24 case studies concerning oil palm over the past three decades showed increased yield of 0.49-3.52 mt of fresh fruit bunches (FFB)/ha/yr; increased income by about 30%; savings in weeding costs by 47- 60% equivalent to 21-62 RM/ha/yr; and an internal rate of return of 19% based on actual field data. The results provide important socio-economic benefits for resource-poor small farmers. Potential increased offtakes and additional income exist with the integration of goats. Additionally, the potential for carbon sequestration with tree crops is an advantage. The reasons for low adoption of the syatems are poor awareness of the potential of integrated systems, resistance by the crop- oriented plantation sector, and inadequate technology application. Promoting wider expansion and adoption of the systems in the future is linked directly with coherent policy, institutional commitment, increased investments, private sector involvement, and a stimulus package of incentives.","journal":"Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences","included":false,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":true}
{"author":"Devendra, C.","year":2012,"title":"Review - Rainfed areas and animal agriculture in Asia: The wanting agenda for transforming productivity growth and rural poverty","dAbstract":"The importance of rainfed areas and animal agriculture on productivity enhancement and food security for economic rural growth in Asia is discussed in the context of opportunities for increasing potential contribution from them. The extent of the rainfed area of about 223 million hectares and the biophysical attributes are described. They have been variously referred to inter alia as fragile, marginal, dry, waste, problem, threatened, range, less favoured, low potential lands, forests and woodlands, including lowlands and uplands. Of these, the terms less favoured areas (LFAs), and low or high potential are quite widely used. The LFAs are characterised by four key features: i) very variable biophysical elements, notably poor soil quality, rainfall, length of growing season and dry periods, ii) extreme poverty and very poor people who continuously face hunger and vulnerability, iii) presence of large populations of ruminant animals (buffaloes, cattle, goats and sheep), and iv) have had minimum development attention and an unfinished wanting agenda. The rainfed humid/sub-humid areas found mainly in South East Asia (99 million ha), and arid/semi-arid tropical systems found in South Asia (116 million ha) are priority agro-ecological zones (AEZs). In India for example, the ecosystem occupies 68% of the total cultivated area and supports 40% of the human and 65% of the livestock populations. The area also produces 4% of food requirements. The biophysical and typical household characteristics, agricultural diversification, patterns of mixed farming and cropping systems are also described. Concerning animals, their role and economic importance, relevance of ownership, nomadic movements, and more importantly their potential value as the entry point for the development of LFAs is discussed. Two examples of demonstrated success concern increasing buffalo production for milk and their expanded use in semi-arid AEZs in India, and the integration of cattle and goats with oil palm in Malaysia. Revitalised development of the LFAs is justified by the demand for agricultural land to meet human needs e.g. housing, recreation and industrialisation; use of arable land to expand crop production to ceiling levels; increasing and very high animal densities; increased urbanisation and pressure on the use of available land; growing environmental concerns of very intensive crop production e.g. acidification and salinisation with rice cultivation; and human health risks due to expanding peri-urban poultry and pig production. The strategies for promoting productivity growth will require concerted R and D on improved use of LFAs, application of systems perspectives for technology delivery, increased investments, a policy framework and improved farmer-researcher-extension linkages. These challenges and their resolution in rainfed areas can forcefully impact on increased productivity, improved livelihoods and human welfare, and environmental sustainability in the future.","journal":"Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences","included":false,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":true}
{"author":"Devendra, C.","year":2013,"title":"Investments on pro-poor development projects on goats: Ensuring success for improved livelihoods","dAbstract":"The elements that determine the success of development projects on goats and the prerequisites for ensuring this are discussed in the context of the bewildering diversity of goat genetic resources, production systems, multifunctionality, and opportunities for responding to constraints for productivity enhancement. Key determinants for the success of pro-poor projects are the imperatives of realistic project design, resolution of priorities and positive impacts to increase investments and spur agricultural growth, and appropriate policy. Throughout the developing world, there exist 97% of the total world population of 921 million goats across all agro-ecological zones (AEZs), including 570 breeds and 64% share of the breeds. They occupy a very important biological and socio-economic niche in farming systems making significant multifunctional contributions especially to food, nutrition and financial security, stability of farm households, and survival of the poor in the rural areas. Definitions are given of successful and failed projects. The analyses highlighted in successful projects the value of strong participatory efforts with farmers and climate change. Climate change effects on goats are inevitable and are mediated through heat stress, type of AEZ, water availability, quantity and quality of the available feed resources and type of production system. Within the prevailing production systems, improved integrated tree crops - ruminant systems are underestimated and are an important pathway to enhance C sequestration. Key development strategies and opportunities for research and development (R and D) are enormous, and include inter alia defining a policy framework, resolution of priority constraints using systems perspectives and community-based participatory activities, application of yield-enhancing technologies, intensification, scaling up, and impacts. The priority for development concerns the rainfed areas with large concentrations of ruminants in which goats, with a capacity to cope with heat tolerance, can be the entry point for development. Networks and networking are very important for the diffusion of information and can add value to R and D. Well formulated projects with clear priority setting and participatory R and D ensure success and the realisation of food security, improved livelihoods and self-reliance in the future.

Location: Worldwide. Methods: We first set a general framework highlighting the prerequisites of a relevant dataset for conservation biogeography. We then illustrate how many different citizen science programmes currently running in different countries can be placed within this framework. Results: We highlight that citizen science is particularly useful to address issues spanning large temporal and spatial extents. We then show how datasets based on citizen science can be used to investigate major aspects of global change impacts on biodiversity. We further highlight why these programmes are also particularly valuable in developing the preventative and educational component of conservation biogeography. Main conclusions: Conservation biogeography requires considerable amounts of data collected over large spatial and/or temporal extents. Beyond increasing technical advances to collect and analyse these data, citizen science seems to be a highly valuable tool in many aspects. However, while citizen science programmes are now popular and increasingly used in several countries, they are lacking in many others. We argue that the development of citizen science programmes should be encouraged as they can both be highly valuable for conservation biogeography and promote the reconnection between people and nature and more generally between people and science.

Particularly where population pressures are high, such woodland types constitute increasingly important elements in land uses which integrate woodland management with crop and livestock production. In southern Africa, colonial and post-colonial management objectives commonly failed to satisfy the end-use requirements of those most dependent on miombo. With ever-growing pressures on this vegetation type, the empowerment of local people is seen as the most promising means of satisfying wants and avoiding the alternative of woodland destruction. Past community controls are by no means necessarily the means of ensuring survival of miombo with its multifarious range of products, including environmmental protection. The necessary reorientation of miombo management calls for a deeper understanding of the impacts of past measures and practices, combined with the equitable devolution of responsibility for natural resources to locally-based management. These steps together with information on household requirements and improved operation of markets will help to assure the future of miombo which will otherwise continue to be degraded and destroyed.","journal":"Commonwealth Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

In principle the community forestry programme is designed to address both environmental quality and poverty alleviation. However, concern has been expressed that forest policies emphasise environmental conservation, and that this has a detrimental impact on the use of community forests in rural Nepal where households require access to public forest products to sustain livelihoods. To study the effect of government policies on forest use, an economic model of a typical small community of economically heterogeneous households in Nepal was developed. The model incorporates a link between private agriculture and public forest resources, and uses this link to assess the socioeconomic impacts of forest policies on the use of public forests. Socioeconomic impacts were measured in terms of household income, employment and income inequality. The results show that some forest policies have a negative economic impact, and the impacts are more serious than those reported by other studies. This study shows that existing forest policies reduce household income and employment, and widen income inequalities within communities, compared to alternative policies. Certain forest policies even constrain the poorest households' ability to meet survival needs. The findings indicate that the socioeconomic impacts of public forest policies may be underestimated in developing countries unless household economic heterogeneity and forestry's contribution to production are accounted for. The study also demonstrates that alternative policies for managing common property resources would reduce income inequalities in rural Nepalese communities and lift incomes and employment to a level where even the poorest households could meet their basic needs.

The community forest user groups of lowland in Nepal have practiced low pricing strategy for high value forest products considering the access of socio-economically poor households. However, the study suggests that even though the low pricing strategy was designed considering poor households, rich households greatly benefited from the forest benefits. The study further enlightens that the low price for high value forest products particularly timber is counterproductive for equitable benefit sharing among the user households in the areas of heterogeneous socio-economic conditions. In addition, the strategy is defective for collecting adequate community fund and carrying out enough livelihood improvement activities at the local level.

Significantly more victims were attacked while collecting minor forest products than during other activities. Probability of attack significantly decreased with increasing distance from forests and villages, and attacks occurred most frequently in the forested north-eastern corridor of the study area. Human activities near the Reserve need to be regulated and limited as much as possible to reduce human mortality and other conflicts. Increasing access to alternative fuel sources (e.g. biogas, solar) may reduce the pressure of timber harvesting on protected areas.

A case study was made in a farm located in the North zone of the state of TÃ¡chira - Venezuela. For the design of the model, a selection was made of 25 % of the pastures dedicated to milk production with buffalos (Bubalus bubalis). The pastures displayed homogenous characteristics in relation to the vegetation present, water surfaces, type of grass (Urochloa decumbens), and management of the animals (rotation). The vegetative species with DAP >10 cm were selected. The species with characteristics of natural regeneration were identified and classified as model parent trees. The dispersion of saplings of natural regeneration was observed. The model contemplates three stages: a) Evaluation of the dispersion. b). Selection and relocation of trees and c) Simulation of the growth of the species. The specie Tabebuia serratifolia was found to have greatest potential of dispersion in each plot. The height and health state of selected trees were evaluated during 5 months. The growth (height) of the trees for a time period of 10 years projected and the behavior of the environmental variables was simulated, based on environmental services in terms of the resources of water, soil and biodiversity. The model allows the incorporation of environmental and social services for the personnel who work in the production unit.","journal":"Modelo silvopastoril de regeneraciÃ³n natural con especies forestales, promotor de servicios ambientales en la zona norte del Estado TÃ¡chira, Venezuela","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

In Mexico, the interface between water and environmental conservation is manifested in initiatives to enlarge \"natural protected areas\" in order to protect both hydrological basins as water sources as well as ecosystems and the services they provide. However, the spatial overlaps, hydrological-biological interactions, and multiple stakeholder institutional interfaces between protected areas and basins remain poorly understood, particularly the ways in which conservation areas are being reconfigured by human water use. Employing spatial analysis, volumes of water concessions, and institutional mapping methods, this paper examines the policy and resource dimensions of groundwater use in the Rio Cuchujaqui watershed and its implications for ecosystem services in the Sierra de Alamos protected area in northwestern Mexico. Competing water and environmental institutional mandates have prevented the formulation of a water management program for conservation purposes. Geographical expansion of the Sierra de Alamos will confront pre-existing Rio Cuchujaqui groundwater uses outside the area currently protected. This impasse can only be resolved by capping groundwater at levels that permit current ecosystem function. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We tried to develop a \"resource light\" method for Systematic Conservation Planning and applied it to the Ewaso Ngiro Landscape of central Kenya. Over a 6-month preparation period and 1-week participatory workshop, we used expert assessments to select focal biodiversity features, set quantitative targets for these, map their current distribution, vulnerability, potential for recovery, and conservation costs, and, finally, map cross-feature conservation priorities. Preparation for and facilitation of the workshop required time investment by one part-time workshop coordinator, eight workshop committee members, six ecosystem experts, and two GIS technicians. Total time investment was approximately 56.5 person-weeks spread over facilitators and 40 workshop participants. Monetary costs for the workshop were approximately $US 42,000, excluding investments made by researchers previous to this project. Costs for a similar workshop could vary substantially, depending on need to cover salaries, international travel, food and lodging, and the number of participants. To stay within our resource constraints, we completed the exercise for only four of nine focal biodiversity features and did not negotiate trade-offs between conservation and human land-uses or use planning software to identify \"optimal networks\" of conservation areas. These were not considered critical for conservationists to try Systematic Conservation Planning, introduce landscape-scale conservation concepts to stakeholders, and begin implementing landscape conservation strategies. Participants agreed that further work would be needed to complete and update the planning process. Due to the lack of comparative cost data from similar planning exercises, we cannot definitively conclude that our approach was \"resource light\", although we suspect it is within the constraints of most site-based conservation projects.

In this study, we examine fishers' perception of a long-established exclusive fisheries zone around Malta and to investigate if the perceptions depend on fishers' demographic, economic, social characteristics and fishing activity of the fishers. A questionnaire survey was undertaken to evaluate the demographic characteristics, economic situation (costs and revenue) and fishers' activity and behaviour, together with their perception of the Fisheries Management Zone (FMZ). A total of 241 interview responses were analysed which was a response rate of 60%. The perception of most fishers was that the establishment of the FMZ has had an overall negative impact on their fishing activity and that the zone is not important for the protection of local fish stocks. When asked about the beneficial effect of the zone for fishers, most fishers from all backgrounds said that the zone does not benefit commercial fishers, but benefits mainly recreational fishers. The most evident differences in the perceptions and attitudes were between the full-time, part-time and recreational fishers. Fishers that have been fishing for more than 35 years and fishers from the main fishing village also had different attitudes from other fishers towards the FMZ. The results of this study suggest that the proportion of individual income derived from fishing was the strongest factor that influenced attitudinal differences, with home port and fishing experience having less important effects. The main differences in attitude among fishers were related to the protection and conservation effects of the zone, enhancement of resources and conflicts among user groups. The heterogeneity among fishers' attitudes revealed by the present study has important implications for the implementation of spatial closures.

The performance-based payment scheme would allow stakeholders in lower-income countries to generate revenue by recovering and maintaining threatened fauna that can also serve as umbrella species (i.e., species whose protection benefits other species with which they co-occur). There are 3 possible options for applying the premium: option 1, embed premiums in a carbon payment; option 2, link premiums to a related carbon payment, but as independent and legally separate transactions; option 3, link premiums to noncarbon payments for conserving ecosystem services (PES). Each option presents advantages, such as incentive payments to improve livelihoods of rural poor who reside in or near areas harboring umbrella species, and challenges, such as the establishment of a subnational carbon credit scheme. In Kenya, Peru, and Nepal pilot premium projects are now underway or being finalized that largely follow option 1. The Kasigau (Kenya) project is the first voluntary carbon credit project to win approval from the 2 leading groups sanctioning such protocols and has already sold carbon credits totaling over $1.2 million since June 2011. A portion of the earnings is divided among community landowners and projects that support community members and has added over 350 jobs to the local economy. All 3 projects involve extensive community management because they occur on lands where locals hold the title or have a long-term lease from the government. The monitoring, reporting, and verification required to make premium payments credible to investors include transparent methods for collecting data on key indices by trained community members and verification of their reporting by a biologist.

In India, the group is well distributed right from the Himalayas up to the rivers of the Western Ghats. Most of the species belong to the genus Tor. Owing to their excellent sporting quality, the mahseers have been variously called as the 'king', 'lion', 'tiger', 'the great fighter', etc., by the anglers. In certain parts of the country, it has also been even given the status of a 'divine fish'. Due to the similarities in the morphometries and meristics, difficulties have been encountered in the correct identification of this group of fishes and recently molecular techniques have been used to resolve such ambiguities. To the local fisher folk and the tribal people residing along the up-streams of rivers, mahseers have been of considerable importance as they contribute much to their livelihood as well as food security. Despite their abundance at one time, mahseers are declining rapidly in different parts of India making them a 'threatened' group. Breeding technology has helped in undertaking conservation programmes of the Himalayan mahseer (Tor putitora) and the Deccan mahseer (Tor khudree). Efforts have also been made to understand the nutritional requirements of these species and to culture these species along with other carps. Though the conventional farming of this fish is not promising because of the slow growth compared to the Indian and Chinese carps, however, by formulating practical diets and appropriate technologies there is scope to harness the potential of this group of fishes. The culture of mahseers has to be undertaken with a multifaceted approach considering their value in sport, food and aim at their conservation and scientific management. The involvement of the private sector like Tata Power Company Ltd., in the conservation of the mahseer has shown that long term commitment can bring desirable outputs. The Coorg Wildlife Society is also trying for the management of the group by promoting the 'ecosystem based fish habitat conservation'. These examples clearly demonstrate the involvement of the private and public sectors with the peoples' participation would provide the much needed support to protect this important group of fishes. In this review, an effort is made to assess the progress on various aspects of taxonomy, biology, nutrition, reproduction, aquaculture and conservation of mahseers. The opportunities available to improve the livelihood of people by increasing the research and development efforts on this group of fishes and its tourism potential are also discussed.","journal":"Indian Journal of Animal Sciences","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The main objectives of this study are to emphasize the variety of forest resources found in the area, to describe their contribution to the local people in 3 different zones of the reserve after the establishment of CTBR in 1998. 84 households were interviewed in 4 hamlets in 2005, 2006 and 2010. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) methods were implemented in order to obtain the information and data. The paper shows that in spite of the strict regulations on conservation the local people in the surveyed areas have been overusing forest resources for both subsistence and cash income. The findings confirm that the people in the core zone (CZ) and the buffer zone (BZ) still got very high forest resource income (FRI), whilst the residents in the transition zone (TZ) were less dependent on the forest resources. Moreover, the income of the residents in the CZ and the BZ increased significantly thanks to the forest resources. All of the well-off and medium households in the CZ got most of their income from forest, resources, especially from uphill cultivation of cashew It is recommended that higher-yielding cashew should be cultivated in areas outside the CZ where Javan Rhinoceros are living; more extension activities of agro-forestry and more participation of the local people involved in forest management and protection are necessary.","journal":"Journal of the Faculty of Agriculture Kyushu University","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

An IK system that continuously evolves and adapts in response to environmental and socio-economic change is often considered to be at the core of sustainable natural resource management practices and rural livelihoods. In the context of indigenous wetland management in western Ethiopia, this paper examines the relationship between IK and wetland sustainability, focusing on the mechanisms through which IK evolves and how local adaptive capacity is built up. A series of participatory research activities undertaken in four wetland communities revealed spatial variations in the degree of innovation and communication taking place. The paper argues that these mechanisms are key factors influencing adaptive capacity, suggesting a key link between wetland sustainability and the occurrence of innovation and communication among communities.

The resilience and sustainability of related local institutions, however, is influenced by their relationship with external actors and institutions, particularly in facilitating, supporting or hindering local institutional arrangements. From this standpoint, this paper examines the case of local community based institutions involved in wetland management in western Ethiopia. Drawing upon the findings of participatory fieldwork undertaken in eight wetland-using communities of Illubabor and Western Wellega zones in Oromia Region it is argued that although local institutions do play a key role in coordinating wetland management and sustaining the benefits from wetlands, the sustainability and resilience of the institutions themselves is threatened by a range of factors. Despite their grassroots nature, their effectiveness is influenced by their reliance on local government backstopping that appears to have diminished in recent years, as well as a perceived lack of local government support for collective action over individual rights.

Even the Malagasy ancestral proverbs never mentioned lemurs, but these same proverbs talked about the now extinct hippopotamus. Madagascar's geography, history, and economic constraints contribute to severe biodiversity loss. Deforestation on Madagascar is reported to be over 100,000 ha/year, with only 10-15% of the island retaining natural forest [Green & Sussman, 1990]. Educating children, teacher-training, and community projects about environmental and conservation efforts to protect the remaining natural habitats of endangered lemur species provide a basis for long-term changes in attitudes and practices. Case studies of three conservation education projects located in different geographical regions of Madagascar, Centre ValBio, Madagacar Wildlife Conservation Alaotra Comic Book Project, and The Ako Book Project, are presented together with their ongoing stages of development, assessment, and outcomes. We argue that while nongovernmental organizational efforts are and will be very important, the Ministry of Education urgently needs to incorporate biodiversity education in the curriculum at all levels, from primary school to university.

Agricultural technologies, for example, irrigation, mechanization, enhanced seeds, crop protection and nutrition products contribute to productivity increases on land already cultivated and, therefore, play a role in preventing further land conversion to agriculture. However, such technologies must be adapted and employed within the context of locally appropriate land management strategies that take an integrated approach to achieving agricultural production, rural livelihoods and biodiversity conservation goals. This paper was developed for presentation at a workshop on 'Conservation Technologies for Sustainable Agriculture', held during the 4th International Weed Society Congress, [4th International Weed Society Congress, Durban, South Africa, 19-25 June 2004.http://www.olemiss.edu/orgs/iws/4intlweedcong.htm>.], It highlights the potential roles a plant science company can play in addressing the challenge of jointly achieving crop productivity and biodiversity conservation objectives. These relate to activities that integrate biodiversity conservation objectives into technology research and development (R&D) of crop protection products and into land management approaches. Three pilot initiatives developed by Bayer CropScience in Brazil, Guatemala and the UK in collaboration with a variety of local stakeholders illustrate how conservation objectives can be embedded in land management practices that sustainably enhance agricultural productivity and profitability, simultaneously addressing food security and biodiversity conservation challenges.

Forest cover can help in efficient ecological process and sustainable utilization of forest base can play a vital role in preventing desertification. A number of regional, national, and international legislations have emerged to protect deforestation and in the long run for preventing desertification. Shifting agriculture, one of the major causes of concern in receding forest cover, is being tried to be transformed into settled agriculture or prevented through legislations. However, what are not holistically understood in context to shifting cultivation are peoples' perceptions and customary laws including land tenure systems. Therefore, implementation of legislations without considering peoples' perception and customary practices are major concerns today. However, some interventions like joint forest management and tribal forest right bill, which are framed by taking scientific inputs into consideration, are positive steps towards sustainable development of traditional societies like tribal communities. This paper examines their conservation laws relating to shifting cultivation and forest protection, and probable reasons for likely desertification in Arunachal Pradesh.

SES management improvement is the aim of many policy measures. But how successful are these various simultaneous policy measures in achieving the sustainable management of SESs? A framework for analysing policy measures and the management actions of land users was developed by Leach et al. (2010): the authors postulate that the sustainability of an SES depends on four system properties - stability, resilience, durability and robustness - and that external shocks and stresses affect these properties differently. The aim of this contribution is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the approach by applying it to three case studies, in Namibia, Argentina and Indonesia. We found that (1) more actions were directed towards resilience and robustness than towards command and control, (2) actions directed at stability and durability were generally undertaken at the national level and (3) the introduction of the concept of robustness to illustrate the property of adaptability enables the identification of trade-offs among properties, but (4) issues of ecological degradation were difficult to address explicitly. We consider that the framework can make a useful contribution to policy making by framing the impact of a given intervention on SESs on the four key system properties. Yet, the framework provides a structure to make ex-post assessment of SES management or to formulate assumptions about potential synergies/trade-offs among impacts on system properties. However, we suggest using it as complementary to other policy impact assessment methods.

A policy to protect the grasslands established in 2001 (the Grassland Ban Policy [GBP]), involves four management practices including grazing bans, keeping grasslands fallow, grazing rotations and rearing livestock in sheds. A questionnaire was developed and used to establish attitudes towards and beliefs about the GBP in different sectors (farming households, local officials and extension workers), assess problems with GBP implementation and identify possible solutions. Acceptance of the GBP by farmers varied from 64% in the north to 95% in the north-west region. The responses of both local officials and extension workers indicated that GBP implementation was greater in the central region than in the north-west region. Most farmers changed their livestock production system from grazing to stall feeding after implementation of the GBP, while both farmers and extension workers reported that high input costs were the most serious problem in stall feeding. Incentives need to be provided for sustainable implementation of the GBP by different stakeholders. Improved collaboration among farmers, local officials and extension workers is needed for technology transfer and policy implementation. Furthermore, the role of non-governmental organizations needs to be strengthened in implementation of the GBP.

The results show that the elements of capital accumulation in a successful FUG were manageable mature forest, high prices for forest products, a system of charging for all forest products, and sales of surplus forest products outside the FUG. The results also suggest that the benefits of funds, community development, and forest improvement changed people's vision and behavior, as well as their attitude toward and understanding of community forestry. This change in attitude has increased interest in and awareness of community forestry and has stimulated thinking about the sustainability of community forestry.

The analysis is based on data from four CBFM sites in the Philippines. The findings suggest that contract NGOs have varying degrees of effectiveness at delivering services, using and encouraging participatory methods, and helping build the capacity of CBFM groups. Because the CBFM program was new, it focused on relatively more straightforward technical and planning functions. The high number and technical difficulty of deliverables, coupled with lack of experience in resource management on the part of some contract NGOs, may have contributed to relatively lower performance in service delivery activities. Contract NGOs performed better in the area of participatory methods, reflecting their experience in grassroots and community development. Capacity-building performance was as expected, relative to the participatory and service-delivery categories. Capacity building activities require long-term commitment and unique sets of skills, and are therefore challenging for the NGOs to implement. More attention to designing feasible and effective contracts is needed. Because CBFM is a long-term strategy, we recommend greater levels of support to help groups develop collective interests in forest resource management and build the capacity to satisfy programmatic requirements.

In the Middle Hills of Nepal, this has led to adoption of Community Forestry with communities keen to conserve forest resources through greater control of access to forest resources. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of Community Forestry on agricultural sustainability using Participatory Learning and Action Research (PLAR) methods and soil and compost nutrient analyses to assess the nutrient balance for rainfed and irrigated fields. Studies demonstrate a yield dependence on annual nutrient inputs to fields, but a remaining positive balance of nutrient inputs. Concerns over soil degradation associated with increasing urea fertilizer dependence highlight the vital role played by organic compost inputs to the soils typified by very low organic carbon concentrations. The findings from two study villages show that Community Forestry has not yet had a major impact (either positive or negative) on farming systems and therefore the majority of rural livelihoods. However, opportunities are recognized that would increase the quantity and quality of compost supply, and consequently crop yields. Increases in natural capital (subcanopy plants) and the increased social capital (provided by Forest User Groups) offer the means through which potential increases to compost materials can be obtained and through which knowledge of the potentials of, and techniques for, improving compost supply could be disseminated. It is such strategies, which go beyond the traditional focus on forests, that will enable Community Forestry in Nepal (which already has many achievements) to realize its full potential in maintaining and improving the livelihoods of the hill farming communities it is intended to assist.","journal":"Land Degradation and Development","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Most community-based PES (CB-PES) research focuses on forest areas. Rangelands, which store globally significant quantities of carbon and support many of the world's poor, have seen little CB-PES research attention, despite benefitting from several decades of community- based natural resource management (CBNRM) projects. Lessons from CBNRM suggest institutional considerations are vital in underpinning the design and implementation of successful community projects. This study uses documentary analysis to explore the institutional characteristics of three African community-based forest projects that seek to deliver carbon-storage and povertyreduction benefits. Strong existing local institutions, clear land tenure, community control over land management decision-making and up-front, flexible payment schemes are found to be vital. Additionally, we undertake a global review of rangeland CBNRM literature and identify that alongside the lessons learned from forest projects, rangeland CB-PES project design requires specific consideration of project boundaries, benefit distribution, capacity building for community monitoring of carbon storage together with awareness-raising using decision-support tools to display the benefits of carbon-friendly land management. We highlight that institutional analyses must be undertaken alongside improved scientific studies of the carbon cycle to enable links to payment schemes, and for them to contribute to poverty alleviation in rangelands.

Responsible behaviour and accountability are at the heart of the Code. It is intended to be implemented in a holistic and transparent manner by governments and stakeholders in all fisheries situations, irrespective of their locations and scale, and contribute, as a result, to the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) and long-term sustainability. The article commences with discussion of the background to the Code, its scope and structure, the associated instruments that have been concluded within the Code's framework, related instruments and, importantly, the technical guidelines that are elaborated by FAO to support the Code's implementation. The next section addresses FAO's role in monitoring and reporting every second year to the FAO Committee on Fisheries on the Code's implementation. Information for this task is collected from governments, regional fishery bodies and non-government organizations by way of a self-assessment questionnaire. This section is followed by a brief discussion of the precautionary approach and the EAF that focuses on parts of the Code that are intended to implement the EAF. The Reykjavik Declaration and subsequent initiatives to deepen the EAF's implementation are also addressed. Stakeholder participation and the role of marine protected areas in promoting the EAF and sustainability are then considered along with the special requirements of developing countries. Some of FAO's activities that contribute to the implementation of the EAF are highlighted. The conclusion points to the need for governments and stakeholders to sustain ongoing activities to support the Code's implementation and for the international community to continue to provide technical and financial assistance to developing countries to ensure that they are not left behind in the implementation process.

As a result, factors affecting the sustainability of these important resources are being undermined. The aim of the paper is to examine trade in two selected NTFPs and implications for sustaining the resource base in Zimbabwe and South Africa. In eastern Zimbabwe, baobab (Adansonia digitata) bark is harvested for craft purposes, but in danger of destruction in the short term as a result of harvesting and trade arrangements. Unless appropriate harvesting and marketing mechanisms including harvesting cycles and adaptive management are adopted, the baobabs and livelihoods of humans will be threatened in the next decade. For wood products from communal woodlands in the South African study, uncontrolled trade poses danger to sustaining the natural woodlands. In both case studies, the role of non-resident NTFP dealers is a source of inevitable threat in promoting sustainable harvesting and trade. Market forces of demand and supply factors are identified as opportunities or threats and presented in a conceptualised framework.

The case of the conservation of coastal wetlands in Ghana (from 1993 to 1999) is utilised in developing a 'community conservation interface' (CCI) model for the active participation of local communities. The ethical basis of the model is to promote accountability, transparency and responsibility throughout a project's planning and implementation process. Additionally, the CCI model seeks to provide a forum, the CCI seat, for resolving conflicts, developing further partnership and building capacity. It is a decision-making model that is applicable to community-based conservation and partnerships in protected area management. As an adaptive management initiative built on the concept of community conservation, the model is vital for decision-making forums for managing biodiversity at a broad-scale level.

Ethnographic methods were used to examine a specific case where the traditional linkages between swidden cultivation and honey collection - the basis of Tagbanua livelihoods and cultural beliefs - were devalued as coercive conservation proliferated at the national park. Park managers upheld the state's conservation discourse that swidden disrupted \"equilibrium\" between livelihoods and forest ecology and, upon enforcing such views, neglected the local embeddedness of swidden cultivation.

However, in the case of South Africa's section of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, political and economic change redirects benefits to support 'modern' economies at the expense of rural livelihoods through community-based natural resources management (CBNRM). Neo-liberal agendas promoted by government and the transfrontier park derail efforts at decentralizing CBNRM initiatives beyond markets and state control. This paper argues that 'hybrid neoliberal' CBNRM has arisen in private and public sector delivery of devolved conservation and poverty relief projects as 'tertiary production' for regional development. As a result, 'CBNRM' projects related to and independent of transfrontier conservation support private sector interests rather than the resource base of rural livelihoods. Concluding sections assert that CBNRM can counter this neoliberal trend by supporting the land-based economy of local users living near the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Arriving out of a desire to rectify the human costs associated with coercive conservation, CBNRM sought to return the stewardship of biodiversity and natural resources to local communities through participation, empowerment and decentralization. Today, however, scholars and practitioners suggest that CBNRM is experiencing a crisis of identity and purpose, with even the most positive examples experiencing only fleeting success due to major deficiencies. Six case studies from around the world offer a history of how and why the global CBNRM narrative has unfolded over time and space. While CBNRM emerged with promise and hope, it often ended in less than ideal outcomes when institutionalized and reconfigured in design and practice. Nevertheless, despite the current crisis, there is scope for refocusing on the original ideals of CBNRM: ensuring social justice, material well-being and environmental integrity.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

In the Philippine uplands, indigenous peoples and migrant settlers co-exist, compete over land and forest resources, and shape how managers preserve forests through national parks. This article examines how migrants have claimed lands and changed production and exchange relations among the indigenous Tagbanua to build on and benefit from otherwise coercive park management on Palawan Island, the Philippines. Migrant control over productive resources has influenced who, within each group, could sustain agriculture in the face of the state's dominant conservation narrative - valorizing migrant paddy rice and criminalizing Tagbanua swiddens. Upon settling, migrant farmers used new political and economic strengths to tap into provincial political networks in order to be hired at a national park. As a result, they were able to steer management to support paddy rice at the expense of swidden cultivation. While state conservation policy shapes how national parks impact upon local resource access and use, older political economic inequalities in forest villages build on such policies to influence how management affects the livelihoods of poor households.

Relatively few studies, however, consider the power interests at stake. Why do state agencies decentralize power, what political patterns unfold, and how do outcomes affect the responses of resource users? This paper explores decentralization reform by investigating the political processes behind the Philippine state's decisions to transfer authority over national parks management to local government units. Drawing on a case of devolved management at Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Palawan Island, we examine how political motives situated at different institutional scales affect the broader process of decentralization, the structure of management institutions, and overall livelihood security. We demonstrate how power struggles between the Philippine state and City Government of Palawan over the right to manage the national park have impacted the livelihood support offered by community-based conservation. We conclude that decentralization may offer empowering results when upper-level policies and political networks tie into sufficiently organized institutions at the local level.

Ecologists must become more assertive in providing scientifically formulated and adaptively managed interventions, involving biodiversity payments, to serve local, regional and global interests in tropical nature. Priorities for tropical ecologists thus include the identification of key thresholds to ecological resilience, and the formulation of clear monitoring protocols and management strategies for implementation by local resource managers. A particular challenge is to demonstrate how nature reserves contribute to the adaptive capacity of regional land-use matrices and, hence, to the provision of sustainable benefits at multiple spatial and temporal scales.","journal":"Trends in Ecology and Evolution","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

The three villages, Houtang, Tanamkemtai, and Khokkphayom of the Satun province, were used as a study area. Qualitative methodology was mainly used because the local people had to recall most of the data, which significantly focused on the interrelationship of the parameters involving the roles of sustainable livelihood indicators via key informants, such as the village's senior, headman, and fisherman. The tools for corrected data were applied form rapid rural appraisal (RRA). It found that mangrove forests in the Satun province are recovered forests because of government concession and villagers' deforestation in the past. Almost all villagers are Muslims and can communicate in Pattani Malay, southern local and national languages. At present, villagers are formulating a group for the protection and conservation of mangrove forests, which a government organization supports. Villagers' perceptions about mangrove forests' benefits can be classified as both direct and indirect. The studies' indicators were divided into four dimensions and 17 items: social (four items), natural resource (four items), economic (four items) and productivity (five items). However, this research merely developed indicators of sustainable livelihood in the community around the mangrove forest at the community level without generating a scale or score with which to weigh the indicators. Therefore, it is very significant to carry out further research and to apply the approach in other areas in order to check the completeness of the indicators and to develop suitable weights.","journal":"Asian Social Science","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Such shifts in property rights, however, can generate conflicts, particularly when combined with rapidly increasing values of forest resources. We explored the phenomenon of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) theft in communities in Western Amazonia. Through interviews with 189 Brazil nut collectors in 12 communities in Bolivia and Brazil and participation in the 2006 and 2007 harvests, we quantified relative income derived from Brazil nuts, reported nut thefts, and nut collection and management practices. We found a much greater incidence of reported Brazil nut thefts in Pando, Bolivia than in the adjacent state of Acre, Brazil. Our analyses suggest that three factors may have affected nut thefts in the forest: (1) contrasts in the timing and process of formally recognizing property rights, (2) different historic settlement patterns, and (3) varying degrees of economic dependence on Brazil nuts. Threat of theft influenced Brazil nut harvest regimes, with potentially long-term implications for forest-based livelihoods, and management and conservation of Brazil nut-rich forests in Western Amazonia.

This research compares environmental and socioeconomic benefits of Brazil nut certification for 231 producers in 17 communities in the trinational border region of Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru during the 2006-2007 harvest. Specific objectives were: (1) to analyze differences in \"best management practices\" between certified and noncertified producers; (2) to identify socioeconomic benefits associated with certified nuts; and (3) to explore producer perceptions of nut certification. Organic and Fairtrade certification were associated with better postharvest practices and higher prices, while Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification was related to preharvest planning. Certification was viewed most positively in Bolivia, where producers gleaned financial and social benefits, moderately in Peru, and least positively in Brazil, where benefits were lower or nonexistent.

Tourism in protected areas, which is most frequently associated with eco-tourism, may assume the form of cultural tourism and adventure tourism. In its empirical part, the research covered the Kibale (Uganda) and the Narew River Valley (Poland) national parks. Based on the research, several conclusions can be formulated. Firstly, the research indicates that there is a lot of conflict between the management of national parks and the local population, regardless of where the national park is located, in Central Africa or Central and Eastern Europe. The main sources of conflict include provisions limiting business activity in the parks themselves and in the surrounding areas, as well as enforced taking over of land by the state. Another similarity revealed between the two parks is their multi-functional character. On the one hand, the parks are established with a view to protecting valuable areas, and on the other they are expected to attract tourists (for example, to develop proecological attitudes). Although it is generally acknowledged that protected areas are aimed to serve tourists who are interested in contact with nature, studies conducted in various national parks and reserves demonstrate that a number of visitors come to protected areas to engage in adventure tourism. A considerably lesser number of visitors are interested in cultural tourism, which is to some extent an unfavourable phenomenon, since cultural tourism to a larger degree than adventure tourism provides employment opportunities for the local population and allows to protect those sensitive areas from excessive tourist traffic. This, in turn, may alleviate some of the conflicts between the management of national parks and the residents of the surrounding areas, which should make tourism in protected areas closer to what is known as sustainable tourism.","journal":"Serial","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Dudley, N.; Higgins-Zogib, L.; Mansourian, S.","year":2009,"title":"The links between protected areas, faiths, and sacred natural sites","dAbstract":"Most people follow and are influenced by some kind of spiritual faith. We examined two ways in which religious faiths can in turn influence biodiversity conservation in protected areas. First, biodiversity conservation is influenced through the direct and often effective protection afforded to wild species in sacred natural sites and in seminatural habitats around religious buildings. Sacred natural sites are almost certainly the world's oldest form of habitat protection. Although some sacred natural sites exist inside official protected areas, many thousands more form a largely unrecognized \"shadow\" conservation network in many countries throughout the world, which can be more stringently protected than state-run reserves. Second, faiths have a profound impact on attitudes to protection of the natural world through their philosophy, teachings, investment choices, approaches to land they control, and religious-based management systems. We considered the interactions between faiths and protected areas with respect to all 11 mainstream faiths and to a number of local belief systems. The close links between faiths and habitat protection offer major conservation opportunities, but also pose challenges. Bringing a sacred natural site into a national protected-area system can increase protection for the site, but may compromise some of its spiritual values or even its conservation values. Most protected-area managers are not trained to manage natural sites for religious purposes, but many sacred natural sites are under threat from cultural changes and habitat degradation. Decisions about whether or not to make a sacred natural site an \"official\" protected area therefore need to be made on a case-by-case basis. Such sites can play an important role in conservation inside and outside official protected areas. More information about the conservation value of sacred lands is needed as is more informed experience in integrating these into wider conservation strategies. In addition, many protected-area staff need training in how to manage sensitive issues relating to faiths where important faith sites occur in protected areas.

There is growing recognition that these natural resources have an important role to play in pro-poor water management in many of the world's river basins, but that capacity to optimize these benefits is constrained by a lack of appropriate technologies and tools to do so. The present paper provides an overview of the current state of understanding of these issues and identifies a number of challenges to be addressed, namely the need to: (i) build wider understanding of the value of river fisheries; (ii) understand the water requirements for sustaining river fisheries; and (iii) develop governance arrangements that bring fisheries to the decision-making table. It concludes by distilling from recent reviews of river fisheries valuation, environmental flows, and governance, a set of specific directions that need to be taken in order to meet these challenges.

The successful pursuit of ecotourism will be enhanced if the logic of extraction of this natural resource is appropriately understood so that pertinent policy and institutions can be devised to ensure ecological and therefore economic sustainability. In an effort to contribute to the implementation of appropriate policy this paper examines the limitations imposed by the structure of the global tourist industry and analyzes the conditions in some Caribbean countries that might allow for the succesful pursuit of an ecotourism strategy. The paper works on the theoretical hunch that tourism, as traditionally managed, suffers from the same sorts of constraints of other export-led development strategies: significant damage to the natural environment, substantial income leakages through expatriation of profits; limited forward and backward linkages and high vulnerability to global economic changes. What is the likelihood that ecotourism can define an alternative logic that can sustain local economies and environments? Recent planning efforts in some islands have conceptualized the new form of tourism as \"community-based heritage tourism\" to reflect a focus on sustainable rural development. What are the prospects for such a, locally oriented model in the face of global economic constraints? This paper argues that certain factors such the small geography of the territories; type of tenure tinder which resources are held, the formal and informal institutions tinder which they are managed, the nature of the extraction of the resources and the potential beneficiaries (domestic and global) define the arena for potential success.","journal":"","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Although many authors have voiced their doubts as to the validity of this idea of an \"ecologically noble savage\", this alliance between conservationists and indigenous populations has proven to be relatively stable, especially since it offers both partners strategic benefits. In this article we discuss the question of how this idealised perception of autochthonous cultures as promoted by conservationists affects the self-perception and the resource management systems of these groups and to what degree elements of a scientific conservationism are adopted by them or \"woven\" into their own cultural model. Our case studies from Latin America - the Kuna of Panama's Caribbean coast and the traditional fishers (caicaras) of the Atlantic coast of Brazil - both demonstrate the strong influence of the global conservationist discourse. The Kuna are an example of a culture with a relatively strong cultural cohesion. Social change and a strong group identity are not a contradiction for them and they are thus in a position to integrate regulative standards of scientific conservationism (biological reserves, seasonal restrictions) into their own institutional system. The caicaras on the other hand were first recognised by the scientific and the conservationist community as an independent cultural group; a clear delimitation of the groups, however, is not possible. But as membership in this group has since been tied to certain privileges, above all the right to live in the highly regulated conservation areas, the term \"traditional population\" has acquired a strategic value for many actors.","journal":"Geographische Zeitschrift","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Respondents appreciate the forest mainly due to the natural resources and the environmental services that it brings. They showed a positive attitude in relation to conservation initiatives and also to the establishment of the biosphere reserve, even when they did not observe concrete benefits from conservation. While the existence of positive attitudes is an en-couraging result, the study also reveals a lack of knowledge and information amongst communities about the purposes, projects and activities in the protected area, indicating a scant intervention of local people in the area management. It is necessary to consider that attitudes are dynamic and unfavorable changes can occur if central aspects of protected area management are not improved. Space for social participation is needed, as also is the access of local residents to decision making processes or to compensation for conservation costs.","journal":"Pensar positivo no basta.

In an attempt to redress the problems, integrated conservation and development projects have been initiated. The original aims to protect a representative ecocomplex are now expected to be achieved by understanding people's requirements and enhancing traditional practices or providing alternatives, and the aims have been expanded to promote the sustainable use of resources also outside of reserves. These two projects, at Andohahela and Soalala, are duly considered, using a framework that has been developed to understand local people's behaviour in relation to resources. Economic, energy, cultural, and ecological, factors, acting as interdependent systems, are considered. The economic, energy, and cultural, factors influence each other, acting together to define the values or resources to people and driving their behaviour in relation to those resources. The behaviour affects the ecological system and may alter the availability of useful resources, depending on the level of use and their resilience. The availability of resources affects the energetic effort required to collect them, so establishing a feedback link. The aims of the projects are to establish ecological equilibria that protect the reserves and enable sustainable use to be made of resources outside the reserve. To achieve these goals they must influence people's behaviour suitably. Strategies include strengthening feedback from the ecological system, and providing energy or economic incentives. Development activities which aim to promote sustainable use of resources and protect biodiversity, through maintenance of the protected area, are assessed. Many projects give a high priority to income generation and improved access to social services; however, the conservation aims of a project often require a better targeted, resource management-based development package. This paper advocates the consideration of economic, energy, ecological, and above all cultural, factors in the design of effective activities for conservation and development projects. In Madagascar, little consideration for the resource requirements of local people have led to their suffering from acute pressure from local exploitation. To redress the problems, the promotion of sustainable use of resources have been expanded to areas outside of reserves. Two projects, at Andohahela and Saalala, are duly considered using a framework that has been developed to understand local people's behaviour in relation to resources. Development activities which aim to promote sustainable use of resources and protect biodiversity through maintenance of the protected area are assessed.

Even with a high level of interspersion between conservation, tourism and fishing management zones, major differences in densities of economically important species were evident between zone types prior to enforcement of fishing restrictions. Densities of the most valuable fishery resource, sea cucumbers, were three times higher in zones that remained open to fishing compared to 'no-take' conservation zones, and densities of sharks were five times higher in tourism zones than fishing or conservation zones. These results highlight bias in the socio-political processes that can accompany selection of marine protected areas, where fishers attempt to minimize perceived impacts on their livelihood by locating large protected zones in resource-poor areas, and tourism operators and sport divers argue for protection of areas containing atypically-interesting features. Bias in the location of fully protected zones can seriously confound 'control-impact' field investigations when data prior to prohibitions on fishing are lacking, including meta-analyses, which arc dominated by such potentially systematically biased studies.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Edmunds, D.; Wollenberg, E.","year":2001,"title":"Historical perspective on forest policy change in Asia","dAbstract":"Whether motivated by efforts to reduce the state or by groups seeking to empower forest communities, forest devolution policies have generated high expectations. Transferring forest management authority from poorly funded, top-heavy bureaucracies to forest users with interests in maintaining a healthy and productive forest will save the state money, improve forest quality, provide greater benefits to those who need and deserve them, and make decision making more democratic. Or so the thinking goes.1 Unfortunately, from the perspective of the poorest forest users-the small-scale farmers and goat herders; the collectors of fodder, medicinal plants, or fuelwood; the woodcarvers, leaf-plate makers, and other artisans-the outcomes have often been disappointing. There are instances where forests have grown healthier, where the poor enjoy greater access to forest products and income, and where decision making about these landscapes has become more democratic. In most places, however, increases in forest cover and quality have occurred at the cost of forest uses that supported the livelihoods of the poor. Tangible benefits accrued to local users have been meager, unreliable, and captured mostly by local elites. Forestry officials have retained control of key decisions through burdensome regulations, taxes, and lengthy approval processes. The question is, why? What explains the slow progress in so many places, and the relative success in a few others? Historical analyses, including those in this issue, help us build an explanation for these outcomes. They bring to light the deeper social relations that reforms have not adequately addressed. They identify changes in environmental and social conditions that make a \"return\" to local management problematic. Historical analyses also draw our attention to sources of change that may yet bring about reform more favorable to the poorest forest users.","journal":"Environmental History","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Human dependence on provisioning ecosystem services in particular is mostly acknowledged in developing countries like those in Africa, where many people are poor and reliant on natural resources. The reliance of communities on natural resources in Africa varies from place to place as aridity, vegetation and socio-economic conditions change. In the humid and forested areas in the west and central parts of Africa, food and raw materials coupled with agriculture are important ecosystem services while in the dryer arid and semi-arid countries in southern and northern Africa, tourism, water and grazing are priorities. Overexploitation of resources coupled with large scale agriculture threatens both ecosystem services and livelihoods. The need to safeguard ecosystem services is urgent. There are some efforts to safeguard ecosystem services in Africa. However, realizing benefits to livelihoods still faces serious challenges due to climate change, recent land grabbing and urbanization. These challenges are compounded by the land tenure situation in Africa. Whilst policy goals have been established at both the international and national levels the implementation of such policies and likelihood of them leading to sustainable land management for delivery of ecosystem services remains a key challenge.

The need to develop an integrated approach to meeting different conservation objectives and a shift in focus towards human wellbeing are some of the motivations behind this call. There is currently no widely accepted approach to planning for ecosystem services. This study contributes towards the development of this approach through a review of conservation assessments and the extent to which they include ecosystem services. Of the 476 conservation assessments identified by a set of search terms on the Web of Science, 100 were randomly selected for this review. Of these only seven had included ecosystem services, while another 13 had referred to ecosystem services as a rationale for conservation without including them in the assessment. The majority of assessments were based on biodiversity pattern data while 19 used data on ecological processes. A total of 11 of these 19 assessments used processes, which could be linked to services. Ecosystem services have witnessed an increase in attention received in conservation assessments since the year 2000, however trends were not apparent beyond this date. In order to assess which types of ecosystem services and how they have been accounted for in conservation assessments, we extended our review to include an additional nine conservation assessments which included ecosystem services. The majority included cultural ecosystem services, followed by regulatory, provisioning and supporting services respectively. We conclude with an analysis of the constraints and opportunities for the integration of ecosystem services into conservation assessments and highlight the urgent need for an appropriate framework for planning for ecosystem services.

A grim business-as-usual forecast and a hopeful portfolio of partial solutions","dAbstract":"The threats to the future of biodiversity are many and well known. They include habitat conversion, environmental toxification, climate change, and direct exploitation of wildlife, among others. Moreover, the projected addition of 2.6 billion people by mid-century will almost certainly have a greater environmental impact than that of the last 2.6 billion. Collectively, these trends portend a grim future for biodiversity under a business-as-usual scenario. These threats and their interactions are formidable, but we review seven strategies that, if implemented soundly and scaled up dramatically, would preserve a substantial portion of global biodiversity. These are actions to stabilize the human population and reduce its material consumption, the deployment of endowment funds and other strategies to ensure the efficacy and permanence of conservation areas, steps to make human-dominated landscapes hospitable to biodiversity, measures to account for the economic costs of habitat degradation, the ecological reclamation of degraded lands and repatriation of extirpated species, the education and empowerment of people in the rural tropics, and the fundamental transformation of human attitudes about nature.

The biological component of the model, which is applied to a nine-species Alaskan marine ecosystem, relies on individual optimizing behaviour by plants and animals to establish population dynamics. The biological component is used to define naturalness. By varying harvesting we arrive at different steady-state populations and humans choose from among these steady states. Welfare maximizing levels of the ecosystem services are derived, then it is shown that in the laissez-faire economy overharvesting occurs when the harvesting industry ignores ecosystem services (2) and (3). Lastly, we introduce efficiency restoring taxes and standards that internalize the ecosystem externalities.","journal":"Environmental & Resource Economics","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Today, the Kam cultural landscape largely encompasses the border regions of Guizhou, Hunan and Guangxi Provinces, in which lie verdant riverine mountains and valleys. Sufficient water resources support Kam rice cultivation and the broadleaf and evergreen forests of the humid subtropical montane ecosystem. The Kam have dwelled in this diverse environment for approximately 2, 000 years developing unique livelihood strategies of harvesting fish and grain from paddy fields, integrating agroforestry and agriculture on mountain slopes and applying specialized knowledge and skills in utilizing local natural resources. Kam people believe that spirits inhabit elements in nature and the world around them, thus great respect should be given to these supernatural beings. Kam resource management practices support regional vegetation where hillside pastureland and forage for domestic animals are ample. Kam rice paddies and fishponds have been judiciously maintained, contributing to Kam cultural survival and development.","journal":"Ethnobotany Research and Applications","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

In scenario 1, the blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) is harvestable in the EEZs of Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and the European Union (EU), as well as in the international waters of the Northeast Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea. The Barents Sea is a fringe area for the species, and there are no fisheries for blue whiting there. Hence, Russia is not regarded as a coastal state with respect to the blue whiting fishery. This severely weakens the stability of the coastal state agreement. In scenario 2, the area of distribution of the harvestable stock expands into the Russian EEZ, giving it status as a coastal state with respect to the resource and, thus, a partner in the management agreement. This secures the coastal state coalition the maximum attainable cooperative value and increases the likelihood of a stable coastal state agreement.","journal":"Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This requires a paradigm shift away from the conquest and economic growth mentality which is embedded in our economic, political and social systems which led to the destruction of vast areas of native forests, pollution of inland and coastal waterways and the extinction of numerous species of native flora and fauna. This paper explores the concept of sustainable tourism, how it is related to ecotourism, the rise of ecotourism concept, its activities, definition and principles of ecotourism, the impact of ecotourism (environmental, economic and socio-cultural). It also highlights the importance of community empowerment to achieving successful ecotourism.

However, existing power structures and inequalities along class, gender, or ethnic lines could prevent part of the community from accessing the full benefits of the intervention. An analysis of determinants of the willingness-to-participate in an environmental intervention in a Beirut neighborhood is conducted. Socioeconomic, health-risk distribution, and perception of community efficacy are used as predictors. A randomly selected sample of residents was surveyed. Respondents were asked to specify the frequency with which they were willing to be involved in an intervention to address priority environmental problems in the neighborhood. Bivariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses were conducted. Tests of significance were based on the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the odds ratio (OR). Males versus females (OR = 4.89, P < 0.001), respiratory patients versus nonsufferers (OR = 5.65, P < 0.001), tenants versus house owners (OR = 2.98, P < 0.01), and the less educated versus the more educated (OR = 2.42, P < 0.05) were significantly more likely to be willing to participate. The reluctance of female community members to participate might be a major hindrance to community-based environmental protection and special strategies must be devised to overcome it. On the other hand, respondents suffering from an illness perceived to be related to environmental toxins are likely to be strong participants in environmental conservation efforts. Finally, the study yielded no evidence that belief or lack of it in the efficacy of community action is a good predictor of the willingness-to-participate in such action.

Ukraine's forest sector is in transition from planned socialist to market economy. We evaluated the role of the traditional village system, which was successful for centuries for achieving both common economic as well as these new dimensions of sustainable forest management in Ukraine's Carpathian Mountains. We used the Skole district as a case study that represents one of the most forested areas in Ukraine, and an integral part of Boiko people's ethnographic area. The village is a traditional social-ecological system defined by the traditional land use of pre-industrial cultural landscapes, and a spatial structure with land use zones satisfying different needs. Using documents on regional environmental history, analysis of socio-economic statistics, and interviews with local land users, we evaluated the extent to which the traditional village system supports socio-cultural dimensions of sustainable forest management. Our review of environmental history indicates that after different phases of cultural landscape development during several 100 years, the traditional village system is still a basic unit of the Skole district's forest landscapes. However, data and interviews show that the traditional village system is endangered. Making use of the total economic value of forest landscape resources, including wood and non-wood products and services based on cultural values and biodiversity, is an urgent task. Support of traditional village socio-cultural functions and land use systems including fields, wooded grasslands and forests should be milestones in a regional program of sustainable forest management. Traditional village system zoning and land use systems would be good indicators of sustainable forest landscapes. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This article examines the efforts to promote formal protection in the communal forests of the Guatemalan highlands. It analyses the institutional mechanisms used to create protected areas in the context of a history of profound inequity and of Guatemalaâ€²s new law recognising the existence of communal lands for the first time. Rather than supporting communal institutions and land rights, however, conservation efforts have strengthened the role of municipal governments, leading to fundamental changes in local governance and livelihood strategies and displacing community participation in natural resource management. The article responds to the following questions: What is the relationship between conservation discourse and the demands of indigenous peoples How are the daily local practices of natural resource access and use modified with the creation of protected areas What implications do these processes have on local territorial management institutions And how can conservation mechanisms be designed to strengthen indigenous peoplesâ€² rights?

This paper, therefore, argues for the reality-based adoption of an extension of existing conservation paradigms to incorporate the development of communal rural communities as an integral part of the overall wildlife conservation and management policy in South Africa. The answer to the seeming contradiction in the focus of wildlife conservation and rural development lies in the development of wildlife management programmes based on multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional interaction, by also harnessing scientific knowledge and skills found in the social sciences. In this manner, the present largely lip service related to so-called community participation in wildlife management can be changed into programmes which really achieve conservation-based community development enhancing survival for both the communities and their inherent natural resources.","journal":"Koedoe","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The research was carried out by lessons learnt from communities currently involved in tourism within 4 national parks. These were Ban Mae Klang Luang with Doi Inthanon National Park, Ban Khao Lek with Chalerm Rattankosin National Park, Ban Wang Lung in Khao Luang National Park, and Tambon Krung Ching in Khao Luang and Khao Nan National Parks. Data collection and analysis were done by in-depth interview and questionnaires with SWOT and Cluster analysis. The strengths that made community based tourism (CBT) in national parks successful were complied into 4 aspects: 1) Local involvement -support from national parks particularly in providing opportunities for local communities in national park tourism, support form outside organizations, local organization in charge of tourism administrative management; 2) national and cultural resources conservation - local awareness in natural resource conservation which likely to come about when local people realized benefit gained from tourism in national parks; 3) social and economics - the willingness of local people to involve in tourism and learn tourism service skills, good social relations amongst local people and strong leadership as well as good contact with tour operators; and 4) tourism experiences - the diverse of tourism experiences for visitors ranging from natural to cultural experiences. The policy instruments that local communities perceived as important to the success of CBT in national parks were self regulatory, partnerships, institutional arrangement, building of local awareness in conservation, and local skill development in tourism management and services. Four strategies were proposed as follows: 1) the enhancement of opportunities for local involvement in national park tourism by setting up of effective local organization in charge of CBT, strengthening cooperation amongst communities around national parks to attract external supports, and establishing joint management system of CBT in national parks, 2) the improvement of natural resource conservation in national parks by setting up participatory monitoring of tourism impacts, and establishing collaborative conservation actions amongst stakeholders from tourism revenues, 3) enhancement of social and economic development by improving benefits distribution mechanisms from national park tourism to local economy and building up local capacity of needed skills in CBT business, 4) fostering low impact tourism in national parks by developing and disseminating code of conducts for visitors and tour operators, and implementing interpretation programs in national parks.","journal":"Kasetsart Journal - Social Sciences","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The framework allows stakeholders to assess progress in achieving the often conflicting objectives of alleviating poverty and conserving global environmental values. The study shows that there was little change in either livelihood or conservation indicators over the period 2006 to 2008, and that the activities of conservation organizations had only modest impacts on either. The global economic down-turn in 2008 had immediate negative consequences for both local livelihoods and for biodiversity as people lost their employment in the cash economy and reverted to illegal harvesting of forest products. Weakness of institutions, and corruption were the major obstacles to achieving either conservation or development objectives. External economic changes had more impact on this forest landscape than either the negative or positive interventions of local actors.

The researchers sampled a total of 100 respondents from the Akampka Local Government Area of Cross River State, a forest community in the Cross River National Park. Twenty- five persons were randomly selected from each of the four communities selected for the study, and key informant interviews and focus group discussions were used to elicit data. Results show that the local people are not properly involved in the conservation of their forest, and were not benefiting from the conservation project.

Capacity building in land management is not only a question of establishing a sufficient technological level or sufficient economic resources. It is mainly a question of understanding the interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral nature of land administration systems, and understanding the need for human resource development in this area. Furthermore, capacity building should ensure that the focus is on building sound institutions and good governance rather than just high-level IT-infrastructures. This overall approach to capacity building in land management is used for implementing a new land policy reform in Malawi. The paper presents the new decentralized land policy developed as a response to the current land related problems in Malawi. The deficit in terms of qualified personnel is remarkable and calls for immediate action. An integrated curriculum is developed to provide the necessary skilled technicians and professionals for implementing the new land policy. The curriculum combines the diploma and the bachelor level and it combines the key areas of land surveying, land management and physical planning.","journal":"Survey Review","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

The regular presence of sea lions on the island is not only a touristic attraction in the region, but also a problem to the fishery community. This community faces economic impacts in its activities due to fish depredation caused by sea lions. Because of this issue, the perceptions and attitudes of different stakeholders from the region are important to be considered by managers, so that a realistic and decentralized action plan can be designed. The goal of this study was to analyze how different local stakeholders perceived the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos. Additionally, how these stakeholders differed from each other in terms of attitudes, knowledge and perceptions. In October 2011, January and March 2012, face-to-face interview surveys were conducted with fishermen and tourists, and drop-off questionnaires surveys with business, and tourism professional and teachers, in a total of 150 questionnaires, 30 for each group. The results indicated existence of differences across the five stakeholder groups. It was also suggested that non-direct stakeholders had a more favorable view of the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos and the sea lion, whereas direct stakeholder (the fishermen) saw it as an obstacle to their fisheries activities.

As the name implies, community-based ecotourism has the local community as an integral bulwark. Thus, the objective of this paper is to study the perception of local community in the vicinity of Lata Jarum towards community-based ecotourism. The study area is focused on the surroundings of Lata Jarum and Lata Jarum itself. This area is rich in biodiversity with endemic flora and fauna. A field survey via a structured questionnaire was conducted on 194 village respondents living in the vicinity of Lata Jarum. This is also complemented by observation during field survey. The data were analyzed descriptively. The most significant finding is that the majority have a neutral perception due to a lack of understanding and knowledge about community-based ecotourism. The other findings indicate that both positive perception and negative perception towards community-based ecotourism have a minority perspective. However, the responses for positive perception are larger as compared to the negative perception. The positive perception is mainly due to pecuniary returns whereas those opposing want to maintain the traditional way of life. The concluding remark is that for ecotourism to succeed with effective local community participation, a dual approach i.e. a top-down and bottom-up approach needs to be adopted. Future research on the dual top-down and bottom-up approach including training and development, will help in capacity building.","journal":"Advances in Natural and Applied Sciences","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The tropical sandfish (Holothuria scabra) has, in this context, been reared and produced with mixed success. In the Western Indian Ocean, villagers often participate in the export fishery for sea cucumbers as a source of income. However, with a growing concern of depleted stocks introduction of hatcheries to farm sandfish as a community livelihood and to replenish wild stocks is being promoted. This review identifies and discusses a number of aspects that constitute constraints or implications with regard to development of sandfish farming in the region. The conclusion is that for sandfish farming to live up to its expectations the possible impacts need to be further studied, and that improved evaluation of ongoing projects is required.

For this purpose, we conducted a comparative analysis of two case studies, one study in the north of Minas Gerais state and the other in ParanÃ£ River Basin, situated in southeastern and central Brazil, respectively. We compiled published bibliographical and census-based data for the two regions, concerning the historical human occupation and land use and the environmental and development policies affecting TDF management and sustainable use. Brazilian TDFs usually occur in semi-arid climates, and have been intensely converted mainly to extensive pasturelands in large farms, thus leading to high income concentration in those areas. Our case studies involve less-developed regions that support populations with very low human development indices, which is the norm for Brazilian TDFs. Many of these are traditional populations, such as indigenous and slave descendents, with peculiar cultural practices only recently considered in government policies proposed for the forest management. Though the two regions have similar land use histories, current social-ecological scenarios are very different. In the north of Minas Gerais, TDF conversion policies were debated intensely for the last 15 years, recently resulting in a state law specifically generated to regulate TDF use. Also, this region has 20 conservation units (CUs), some of them delimited inside the territories of the several traditional populations that inhabit TDF areas. This process caused enduring conflicts that can affect both CUs' effectiveness and the sustenance of these populations. In the ParanÃ£ River Basin, there is no specific policy towards TDFs, whose use is regulated by the 43-year-old Brazilian Federal Forest Code. There are only four CUs in this region, and most traditional populations were expelled from their original territories and consequently lost their cultural identity. Government sustainability strategies are limited to the establishment of CUs, a response that may disregard social demands and cultural practices, depending on the local context. Given the uniqueness and threat level to TDFs, specific and more diversified policies towards land use should be established for these ecosystems in order to stimulate low-impact activities that maintain ecosystem services and improve the livelihoods of TDF inhabitants.

The surveyed area, in the tropical rainforest, included two locations inside the park and two locations in the adjacent buffer zone. There were 178 useful species associated with 216 common names found. The most used plant families were: Leguminosae (22 species), Arecaceae (15), Annonaceae (11), Rubiaceae (10) and Bombacaceae (7). A total of 39 uses in eleven categories were found. The categories with a high number of species included Construction (109), Medicinal (40), Food (37), Technology (34) and Firewood (22). The species most recognized by the community were: abarco (Cariniana pyriformis), almendro (Dipteryx oleifera) and guamo (Inga spp.). The milpesos palm (Oenocarpus bataua) was the plant with most uses reported (seven in total). Based on the data collected, potential species are proposed to be incorporated in the strategy of development for the native forest in the adjacent buffer zone of the park.

A survey was conducted in 2007 in five villages to assess local perceptions of human-gorilla totemic kinship practices and taboos against hunting and against eating of gorillas. Villages were selected based on their proximity to Cross River gorilla (CRG) habitat, with a total of 184 interviewer-administered questionnaires completed during a 4-week period. Eighty-six percent of people agreed that gorillas were totems (personal spiritual helpers or counterparts) of people living in the village. People who believed in human-gorilla totemic kinship practice did not eat or hunt gorillas, and they wanted gorillas to be protected in order to protect the practice. Most (87%), of the interviewees declared their support for gorilla conservation. The main motivation was the belief that when gorillas are killed, the human totemic counterpart will die as a result. Because of these traditions, the hunting of gorillas is taboo in all five villages surveyed. On the other hand, gorilla parts play a direct role in traditional medicine, and gorilla bones are valued as ingredients for traditional medicine. Also, general awareness and adherence to local totemic practices was found to be declining, particularly among young people (18-25 years). Despite the imminent decline in value of belief systems that led to the establishment of the hunting taboo, this taboo is still in place and has discouraged the hunting of gorillas. Where law enforcement is weak or near inexistent, these traditional restrictions could be critical to the continuing survival of a gorilla population. Reviving and promoting beliefs and practices conducive to gorilla conservation could foster positive attitudes and behavior and have the potential to encourage local support and participation in communities. However, care must be taken when selecting practices to promote, as some (for example the use of gorillas in traditional medicine) could encourage the killing of animals.

To date, the REDD framework has not demonstrated that it is equipped to incorporate the diverse perspectives, potential interactions and uncertainties facing forest communities. We interviewed forest community members in the Amazonian state of Loreto, Peru, using \"future scenarios\" methods to elicit potential alternative narratives, both with and outside REDD. Indigenous voices reveal ambiguous attitudes toward REDD with regard to livelihoods, benefit distribution and the long-term impacts for communities and forests. They reveal considerable uncertainty about the future and lack of trust in governance regimes. Long-term community priorities were in generating work, providing educational opportunities for their children, and improving the quality of their forest. Conflict-within the community, with local loggers and with the recently established regional conservation area-was a prevalent theme. A REDD design that recognizes communities as active participants in global and national climate management and pays attention to local narratives will more likely generate the multiple benefits of healthy forests, strong communities and, ultimately, global climate change mitigation.

A comprehensive review of 204 potential cases reveals a lack of impact assessments of fisheries co-management. This study reports on a meta-analysis of the impact of fisheries co-management in developing countries in 90 sites across 29 case-studies. The top five most frequently measured process indicators are participation, influence, rule compliance, control over resources, and conflict. The top five most frequently measured outcome indicators are access to resources, resource well-being, fishery yield, household well-being, and household income. To deal with the diversity of the 52 indicators measured and the different ways these data are collected and analysed, we apply a coding system to capture change over time. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that, overall fisheries co-management delivers benefits to end-users through improvements in key process and outcome indicators. However, the dataset as a whole is constituted primarily of data from the Philippines. When we exclude this body of work, few generalisations can be made about the impact of fisheries co-management. The lack of comparative data suitable for impact assessment and the difficulties in comparing data and generalising across countries and regions reiterates calls in other fields for more systematic approaches to understanding and evaluating governance frameworks.

A two-tiered stakeholder analysis was developed to facilitate this. This analytical tool illuminates divergent perspectives between actors in two marine social-ecological systems in Southern Kenya. Investigating these differences emphasises the variety of historical contexts, social geographies, and current power relations in which different groups are situated. These historical and contextual factors mediate how groups perceive and respond to governance. They, therefore, have important implications for how institutions function. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This article compares participatory projects with different styles of management to determine whether increasing the extent or quality of engagement of participants affects the degree to which they learn. The results show that: (1) Participants in all projects learnt something, but the extent of learning was overall highest for projects with greatest engagement; (2) The length of time participants were involved in a project did not influence how much they learned; and (3) a range of factors relating to engagement influenced learning outcomes. The results suggest that if capacity building is a desired outcome of participation, then it pays to invest in high levels of engagement right from the outset.

It is possible to map these benefits and costs, as well as their many affected beneficiaries, on the basis of ecosystem services, and also to ascribe economic values to the various consequences of land uses. Using the case study of the Mvoti catchment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, different land uses are mapped semi-quantitatively according to their relative benefits and costs to private landowners and wider public livelihoods within the catchment. Using 'paying for ecosystem services' (PES) principles, it is possible to develop market models for charges for land and water use based on the erosion of public well-being, to target subsidies to change land uses to maximise public benefits, and to propose hypothecation between these charges and subsidies to develop internal markets for ecosystem services within the catchment. Lessons learned have relevance for land use elsewhere in the world,including more equitable and sustainable implementation of the 2003 EU Common Agricultural Policy reform and of the 2000 Water Framework Directive.","journal":"Environmental Law and Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Mahseer fishes of the genus Tor are 'iconic species' in Indian rivers, representing 'flagship' species for conservation purposes but with additional exploitable, cultural and economic values. Conservation action is required to address their vulnerability to numerous pressures on multiple habitats, and connections between them, across the extended aquatic ecosystems supporting different life stages. 2. Recreational angling for mahseer, along with associated wildlife and cultural tourism, is a growth industry dependent upon healthy river ecosystems. 3. A cyclic, ecosystem-based model in which local people can benefit economically from sustainable mahseer exploitation through catch-and-release fisheries can form a basis for conservation of both mahseer and the wider river ecosystem. 4. Experience on the Western Ramganga River in the vicinity of the town of Bikhyasen, Uttarakhand State (in the Himalayas in northern India), demonstrates the importance of involving local people in the benefits associated with angling, wildlife and cultural tourism. This creates local incentives for river protection, and may be the most effective means for preventing destructive over-exploitation in poor rural communities. 5. Recognition of this value and its recirculation to local people can form the basis for a 'paying for ecosystems services' (PES) market. This will benefit river ecosystems, local people, tour operators and visiting anglers, provided that local people benefit to a greater extent than through the killing of fish for non-renewable consumption or sale. 6. This is the basis for a potentially transferable model which may support regional development through involving local people in markets for iconic species.

This paper reports a study on the preference of local people for different incentives that could help increase local support for nature conservation. It also explores the possibilities for designing a sustainable incentive strategy. Data were obtained from personal interviews conducted with community members around the Okwangwo Division of the Cross River National Park in south-east Nigeria, and were analysed using a multinomial logit model. The results showed that skill development was the most preferred incentive, followed by community forestry. The gathering of non-timber forest products under the supervision of national park officials was least preferred. The local people's preferences were influenced by factors such as education, extraction of bush mangoes, membership of environmental group, farmland size, income from non-timber forest products, ownership of commercial cocoa farms and gender. We conclude that an incentive-based strategy for nature conservation will be more effective if local people are more involved in negotiations regarding the incentive that are being offered. The findings from this study could assist nature conservation managers in designing a more acceptable and effective nature conservation strategy.

However, in most developing nations local people who reside at the vicinity of the park expect that it should also contribute to the social and economic well-being of the people. This paper examines the contribution of the Okwangwo Division of the Cross River National Park, Nigeria, to the provision of various types of infrastructure and income from tourism. Personal interviews were conducted in 150 households in three villages around the park. The study showed that the park has contributed to the provision of infrastructure. Some of the projects, undertaken by the park management, appear to be capital intensive both in the short and long term, thus, risking to make them unsustainable. The results revealed that only one of the villages in the study area benefits from the income from tourism. We suggest that simple, non-capital intensive and sustainable developmental projects should be undertaken. The tourism sector of the local economy should be developed to make income from tourism attractive for more of the local people. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

During the apartheid and colonial periods indigenous people lost their rights to use land and natural resources. Protected areas were seldom established in consultation with local communities, and, between 1900 and 1990, millions of citizens were forcibly removed from areas proclaimed as nature reserves, national parks, or game reserves. Conservation conflicts in southern Africa escalated because of: i) the many and complicated issues at stake; ii) the large investment by communities and conservationists in the main causes of the conflict - land and natural resources; iii) communities and conservationists harming each other, rather than striving towards common goals; iv) negative perceptions on both sides; v) weak and infrequent communication between role players; vi) the hostile relations between them; and vii) the use of violent and coercive tactics on both sides. In the late 1980s and early 1990s a wave of democracy swept across southern Africa, and with it came new policies that allowed communities better access to natural resources, called for their participation in protected area management, and facilitated the restitution of land from which they had been forcibly removed. This resulted in a number of tangible and intangible gains for conservation and communities, respectively. The short-term effect on the underlying causes of conflict was positive. Relations and communication improved, communities and conservationalists identified common goals, and tactics became less hostile than before. There are still, however, a number of causes for concern. Both parties now have even more invested in the new agreements than before, and the number of complicating issues has increased rather than decreased. New conflicts and power struggles are emerging, this time between different factions in communities and conservation agencies, respectively. The high expectations on both sides that the new approach will yield significant tangible short-term benefits are a further cause for concern. Experience and provisional research have shown that the financial benefits from wildlife, forestry, and tourism are mostly overestimated. The conventional assumption, that devolution of power to the smallest local group will inevitably result in good governance and sustainable resource management, could be flawed. It is essential for government to recognise this problem and identify appropriate strategies such as mediation services at the local level, the creation of new, locally made rules and their enforcement, engaging in collaborative research with local communities, and adopting adaptive management approaches, characterised by regular monitoring and flexibility. Relying on the simplistic and romantic principle that traditional knowledge is pure and intrinsically valid, and creating unrealistic expectations about the benefits of co-management, could invite new conflicts that may be more difficult to manage than the tensions of the colonial and apartheid eras.","journal":"Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Members of a local Xhosa community who lived adjacent to the Great Fish River nature reserve in the former Ciskei, Eastern Cape, were employed to assist us with an inventory of locally useful plants. The survey was designed to quantify differences in plant diversity between the nature reserve and the adjacent communal area, from the point of view of indigenous plant users. Traditional healers and rural villagers who were experienced users of indigenous plants were recruited with the aid of a community organisation. Plants which were used for physical and spiritual healing, fuel, food and construction were identified along paired transects in the nature reserve and the communal area, respectively. Hierarchical richness indices (HRIs) and the number of recognisable plants as well as their abundance at each site were used to compare the nature reserve to the communal area. Altogether, 122 utilised plant types were recorded, of which 68% had medicinal or spiritual value, 12% were used for food, 13% for fuel and 7% for building purposes. These ratios were similar for both the nature reserve and the communal area. One hundred and eight (108) useful types of plants were recorded on the nature reserve and 97 in the communal area. The nature reserve contained 25 'unique' recognisable plants which were not recorded in the communal area, whereas the communal area contained 14. Useful plants were more abundant on the nature reserve than in the communal area, and the average HRI for the nature reserve was almost double that of the communal area. The advantages to the community were limited: temporary employment was created and local skills were developed which might have improved the people's prospects for future employment. The conservation benefits were more substantial: information became available which would otherwise have remained hidden, relations between the community and conservation agencies improved, and credible education programmes in sustainable resource use could be developed through a participatory approach. The next step from a management point of view is to provide opportunities for the community to interpret and apply the results, and with the local people, to explore small business opportunities based on the cultivation of useful plants. Participatory research and monitoring could be furthered by putting greater emphasis on the participatory process than on results, by actively involving local people in the development of monitoring programmes from the outset, and by interpreting and deliberating the results of monitoring with them in an interactive way.","journal":"South African Journal of Science","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Fabricius, C.; Collins, S.","year":2007,"title":"Community-based natural resource management: Governing the commons","dAbstract":"Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) focuses on the collective management of ecosystems to promote human well-being and aims to devolve authority for ecosystem management to the local (community) level. CBNRM therefore requires strong investments in capacity development of local institutions and governance structures. CBNRM has come under strong criticism for its failures to deliver real benefits to communities. In this paper we explore the reasons for the frequent failure of CBNRM. We postulate that good governance buffers CBNRM against unexpected change, notably conflicts, especially in the early stages when income generation, infrastructure development and capacity development have not yet taken place. We assess the key characteristics of CBNRM governance systems that could perform this buffering function, using case study examples from Macubeni, Nqabara, Makuleke and Richtersveld to support our propositions. In our case studies, 11 strategies have been used to increase the incidence of success of CBNRM: understand and describe the social-ecological system; establish and communicate a clear vision; build on local organizations; plan ahead; create rules for resource use and enforce them; communicate the vision, plan and rules; develop management capacity; finance the initial stages of the initiative; work within available legal frameworks; monitor and learn all the time; and create lasting incentives. Despite these strategies there are, however, a number of obstinate implementation challenges, related to governance shortcomings and external factors which management cannot control. We therefore propose seven additional strategies to promote good governance in CBNRM: 1. Develop knowledge networks that draw on the experience and wisdom of a wide range of key individuals. 2. Establish formalised decision-making structures (e.g. multi-level project steering committees) with clear constitutions and codes of conduct. 3. Clearly define and legitimise conflict resolution procedures. 4. Ensure acceptance of the governance structure by community members. 5. Obtain formal commitment to well-defined roles and responsibilities by key individuals. 6. Establish tangible incentives to key individuals for meeting their commitments. 7. Develop the capacity for facilitation to promote communication. Local communities, government and scientists have important roles to play in maintaining these knowledge and governance networks through adaptive co-management.

These NTFPs include: Cola nitida, Ricinodendron heudelotii, Gnetum africanum and Irvingia spp. However, farmers find it difficult to achieve good returns from these products, even with viable national, regional and international markets for the products. In response to that, ICRAF-AHT (Africa Humid Tropics) is leading a \"Farmer Enterprise Development\" project aimed at empowering rural households through the development of appropriate marketing strategies that can be used for a range of products. The innovative approach combines training and development of farmer entrepreneurial skills, the development of NTFPs markets through adding value and developing appropriate technologies to improve product quality, harvesting, storage, processing and packaging. The approach is based on research, development of appropriate technologies, partnerships and farmers' group -enterprise development. This paper looks at the importance of biophysical and market research in order to develop a holistic enterprise development strategy using kola nut as a case study. Results show that there are clear limitations to significantly increasing income from kola nuts business in Cameroon: limited market access, low resource regeneration, limited available capital, and lack of appropriate processing technology. Results also show that kola weevils (Balanogastris kolae & Saphrorhinus spp.), attacking the nuts both prior to harvest and during storage, are the major problem faced by kola producers, wholesalers, retailers and even consumers. Economic simulations have demonstrated that reducing post-harvest losses to 5% and increasing production by 5% could increase the profitability of the kola nut business by 17%. The efficiency of various weevil control methods as used by farmers is assessed in on-farm trials to provide appropriate control approaches. Meanwhile, group-marketing approaches are also evaluated with farmer groups in the Northwest province of Cameroon and links between kola producers and traders are established.","journal":"Serial","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

When it comes to landscape management and the evaluation of the benefits these services provide for our well-being, there is a limited representation of stakeholder and intangible values on the land. Stakeholder knowledge is essential, since disciplinary expert evaluations and existing proxy data on landscape services can reveal little of the landscape benefits to the local stakeholders. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of using local stakeholders as key informants in the spatial assessment of landscape service indicators. A methodological approach is applied in the context of a rural village environment in Tanzania, Zanzibar, where local, spatially sensitive stakeholder knowledge is crucial in solving land management challenges as the resources are used extensively for supporting community livelihoods and are threatened by economic uses and agricultural expansion. A typology of 19 different material and non-material, cultural landscape service indicators is established and, in semi-structured interviews, community stakeholders map these indicators individually on an aerial image. The landscape service indicators are described and spatially analysed in order to establish an understanding of landscape level service structures, patterns and relationships. The results show that community involvement and participatory mapping enhance the assessment of landscape services. These benefits from nature demonstrate spatial clustering and co-existence, but simultaneously also a tendency for spatial dispersion, and suggest that there is far more heterogeneity and sensitivity in the ways the benefits are distributed in relation to actual land resources. Many material landscape service indicators are individually based and spatially scattered in the landscape. However, the well-being of communities is also dependent on the non-material services, pointing out shared places of social interaction and cultural traditions. Both material and non-material services are preferred closest to settlements where the highest intensity, richness and diversity are found. Based on the results, the paper discusses the role of local stakeholders as experts in landscape service assessments and implications for local level management processes. It can be pointed out that the integration of participatory mapping methods in landscape service assessments is crucial for true collaborative, bottom-up landscape management. It is also necessary in order to capture the non-utilitarian value of landscapes and sensitivity to cultural landscape services, which many expert evaluations of landscape or ecosystem services fail to do justice.

Analysis and findings","dAbstract":"Integration of farmers' knowledge and perception with researchers' knowledge is important for planning resource-conserving technologies. In many places in the world, fanner participation has been shown to be essential in the planning of sustainable land management. The findings of a participatory approach (PA) for integrated conservation planning in the Danangou catchment-a small catchment situated in the heart of Loess Plateau-are presented in this paper. The work was carried out by an interdisciplinary team during the period 1997-2000. The PA is an interactive learning process between local farmers and researchers. The process was facilitated by several visualisation and diagramming methods. This formed part of an integrated conservation planning approach, where three tools including PA, land evaluation and soil erosion modelling were combined within the entire conservation planning process. The Danangou catchment is characterised by its distribution of cropping systems on all degrees of slope to meet the food needs of the villagers. Farmers' criteria on land suitability, including slope aspect and soil workability, were evaluated. Farmers approved several biological and physical conservative measures, which provided one of the important bases for formulating different land use scenarios (LU scenarios). The factors influencing farmers in choosing different LU scenarios were analysed, including (1) current household economy in relation to production from the land; and (2) prediction of changes in the household economy due to different LU scenarios. The farmers' vision on implementation of the LU scenarios, i.e. gradually converting cropping land, conforms well with the plans of the local government. However, due to the poor living standard and lack of off-farm employment, any effort to improve land use towards more sustainable practices seemed to be difficult to implement without support from the government in terms of food, seedlings and also sources of employment for the villagers. The strategy for conversion work in connection with the central government policy on re-greening the Loess Plateau must focus first on areas where off-farm activities are available or potentially available. A diversity of conservation alternatives was found to meet the needs of different farmers' groups. It is recommended that alternatives be developed by an active collaboration between farmers, extensionists and researchers.

Recent trade-off studies have highlighted the need for better biodiversity measures, to complement measures of ecosystem services. Biodiversity typically has been linked in this context to existence and other non-use values. We argue that biodiversity will have a stronger role in such trade-off analyses if measures of biodiversity better reflect additional current and future services. These 'evosystem services' have been, and, if we are careful, can continue to be provided by the evolutionary process. Some services have been provided through evolution operating in the past, and a phylogenetic diversity measure can help us to quantify these current and potential future benefits derived from the tree of life. Furthermore, a variety of evosystem services are delivered through ongoing contemporary evolution, and value should therefore be placed on the maintenance of healthy evosystems. We argue that the concept of evosystem services could be useful as a complement to the traditional concept of ecosystem services. Together, these reflect a fuller range of the services supported by biodiversity, and thereby provide a sounder basis for conservation planning and decision-making.","journal":"Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

It also provides an overview of the approach to governance reform that will be taken by the Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem and Adjacent Areas Project. The geopolitical complexity of the Caribbean region is such that regional governance appears to be more challenging there than in most other regions. The proximity of states leads to a high incidence of transboundary issues regarding living marine resources. The high proportion of small island developing states (SIDS), defined at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development as countries facing specific social, economic, and environmental vulnerabilities, and high incidence of coastal use for industry, tourism, fisheries, and urban development leads to heavy impacts on coastal and marine resources. Regarding institutional arrangements, there are many organizations at regional and subregional levels already engaged in most aspects of marine resource management, sometimes in collaboration, sometimes in competition, and often in relative isolation. Likewise, at national and local levels there is a host of government and nongovernmental organizations with diverse aspirations and perspectives. The challenge then is to develop a regional approach that recognizes the existence of this diversity and works with it. The development of the Caribbean LME and Adjacent Areas Project has forced regional partners to reflect on the Caribbean living marine resource governance situation.

Huaying Grand Canyon, Sichuan Province, China","dAbstract":"In recent years, geoparks (a geoheritage effort to protect geological features) have been vigorously promoted in China and abroad. The evaluation of a geopark is important for geopark development. However, current evaluation methods focus on geoheritage and their values, and often ignore residents' situations, even though community participation is essential to the sustainable development of geoparks. In this paper, the Mt. Huaying Grand Canyon Geological Park was selected as a study area to evaluate resident's perceptions of the park. Perception impact factors were selected from the perspective of the park residents. Quantitative evaluation models, based on data from questionnaires, were created using the hierarchy process model and expert evaluation method. The results showed that the following factors influenced residents' perceptions, listed from the most significant to the least: residents' understanding of geoheritage, participation level in commercial activities, participation level in planning decisions, satisfaction level regarding benefit distribution and level of participation willingness. It was found that residents' level of understanding of geoheritage and their participation level in planning decisions were the main reasons for poorer perceptions of geoheritage. The keys to improving residents' perceptions of geoheritage are to change the management system, implement people-centered policies and to establish a government-led management mode that encourages community participation and involves private business contracts.

Usage patterns of mangrove resources can also affect their ability to respond to change. Brazilian artisanal fisherfolk are highly dependent on mangrove resources and services, which makes them also vulnerable to climate change. These populations have to cope with high levels of uncertainty related to the availability of natural resources, and to social and political contexts, such as biodiversity conservation policies. Besides being protected by many different laws, mangroves are also included in no-take protected areas. This may contribute to their resilience as natural systems, but can enhance the vulnerability of human populations. We propose herein a research methodology for assessing the vulnerability to climate change of the social-ecological system mangroves - fisherfolk, by analyzing exposure to sea-level rise, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, and the impacts of conservation policies on these elements, particularly the effects of coastal protected areas in southern Brazil. An integrated social-ecological diagnosis may lead to more flexible policies, elaborated with stakeholders' participation, more adequate to local realities and more inclusive of strategies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.","journal":"Metodologia para anÃ¡lise da vulnerabilidade de pescadores e manguezais Ã s mudanÃ§as climÃ¡ticas","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Using a case study of the conversion of mangrove ecosystems to shrimp aquaculture, this article describes an effort to develop a transdisciplinary, transinstitutional approach to conservation that simultaneously trains future generations of environmental problem solvers. We worked in close collaboration with academics, non-government organizations, local government and local communities to organize a workshop in Puerto Princesa, Palawan, Philippines. The primary objectives of the workshop were to: (1) train participants in the basic principles of ecological economics and its goals of sustainable scale, just distribution and efficient allocation; (2) learn from local community stakeholders and participating scientists about the problems surrounding conversion of mangrove ecosystems to shrimp aquaculture; (3) draw on the skills and knowledge of all participants to develop potential solutions to the problem; and (4) communicate results to those with the power and authority to act on them. We found that the economic and ecological benefits of intact mangroves outweigh the returns to aquaculture. Perversely, however, private property rights to mangrove ecosystems favor inefficient, unjust and unsustainable allocation of the resource-a tragedy of the non-commons. We presented the workshop results to the press and local government, which shut down the aquaculture ponds to conserve the threatened ecosystem. Effective communication to appropriate audiences was essential for transforming research into action. Our approach is promising and can be readily applied to conservation research and advocacy projects worldwide, but should be improved through adaptive management-practitioners must continually build on those elements that work and discard or improve those that fail.

A survey was conducted in 1991-94 of two villages inhabited by Bhotiya tribal people in Dharchula block of Uttar Pradesh, India. Medicinal herbs (14 abundant species, with Partnelia ramitchadalis accounting for >50% by weight) constitute 12-13% of total income to the villages. The harvest is conducted by children during August to October, around summer settlements (up to 4100 m altitude) to which the villagers annually migrate. Fifteen cooperatives with a 1992 membership of 7009 herb collectors and salespeople exist in the Dharchula block, and marketing is through two specialist government agencies. Conservation measures, including protected areas and banning of direct trade with purchasing companies, have not generally been successful; pressure on the plant populations has increased and there is evidence for decline in the resource. Cultivation appears to represent a viable option for the resource, and thus for the income of the traditional peoples who still depend on it.

This paper contributes to sustainable tourism by presenting local decision-making practices and issues arising from the perspective of the members of one village in the BoumÄ National Heritage Park, Fiji. It shows that introduced democratic decision-making systems may not contribute to political empowerment in CBEM and can cause difficult situations. It is argued that greater attention to local systems of governance is required if tourism practitioners are to fully understand decision-making and participation in CBEM. The paper also offers a culturally appropriate methodology that may produce more meaningful outcomes for sustainable tourism research in indigenous Fijian contexts, and in other contexts worldwide. It argues that levels of empowerment should not just be treated as the outcome but as a part of the process of tourism development. It explores the core Fijian cultural concept of vanua as a way of life, involving interrelated social, ecological and spiritual elements.

On the other hand, they also serves as livelihood for millions of people living in such rural areas engaged in smallholder agriculture. Driven by international market forces, these areas play a central role in the production of the global cash crops cocoa, soybeans or palm oil. The frontier zones of Central Sulawesis mountainous rainforests are part of the Wallacea global biodiversity hotspot and particularly threatened due to forest conversion into agricultural land, mainly cacao plantations. In order to meet the challenge between conservation and utilization an economic and ecological balanced concept needs to be developed.

This paper captures the implicit understanding of seven experienced on-ground conservation managers about the conservation issues affecting the Ramsar listed Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales, Australia. Multiple interviews, a workshop, and meetings were used to elicit the manager's knowledge. The managers suggest that the Macquarie Marshes are seriously threatened by a lack of water, and immediate steps need to be taken to achieve more effective water delivery. Their knowledge and perceptions of the wider societal impediments to achieving more effective water delivery have also led the managers to suggest that there may be system feedbaks that are reinforcing the tendency for water agencies to favor the short-term interests of the irrigation industry. Although the managers clearly have certain personal interests that influence their understanding and perceptions, much of their knowledge also appears to have been heavily influenced by their ecological understanding of the wetland's dynamics. This paper highlights that although all stakeholders clearly need to be involved in making decisions about conservation and how resources should be used, such decisions should not be confused with the need for consulting people with the appropriate ecological expertise to help determine the degree to which an ecological system is threatened, the likely ecological causes of the threats, and actions that may be needed to restore and maintain a functional ecosystem.

Analysis of transition dynamics from agroforests to monoculture plantations in Indonesia","dAbstract":"Cash crops are developing in the once forested areas of Indonesia in parallel with market and economic improvements. Perennial crops such as coffee, cocoa, and rubber were first planted in estates by private or public companies. Local people then integrated these crops into their farming systems, often through the planting of agroforests, that is, intercropping the new cash crop with upland rice and food crops. The crop was generally mixed with fruit trees, timber, and other useful plants. A geographic specialization occurred, driven by biophysical constraints and market opportunities, with expansion of cocoa in Sulawesi, coffee in Lampung, and natural rubber in eastern Sumatra. However, during the past three decades, these agroforests have increasingly been converted into more productive monoculture plantations. A common trajectory can be observed in agricultural landscapes dominated by a perennial cash crop: from ladang to agroforests, and then to monoculture plantations. This process combines agricultural expansion at the expense of natural forests and specialization of the land cover at the expense of biodiversity and wildlife habitats. We determined the main drivers of agricultural expansion and intensification in three regions of Indonesia based on perception surveys and land use profitability analysis. When the national and international contexts clearly influence farmers' decisions, local people appear very responsive to economic opportunities. They do not hesitate to change their livelihood system if it can increase their income. Their cultural or sentimental attachment to the forest is not sufficient to prevent forest conversion.

With the use of socio-economic surveys, from February to July 2006, we established that the amount of the annual fuel-wood harvest for five study sites was about 102,650 m(3) (i.e., an amount equivalent to clearing about 205.3 ha of mangrove forests annually). It is estimated that approximately 62% of this total is used to smoke most of the fish (i.e., about 90.7% of the fish landings) across the five study sites. The quantities of wood seemed to vary proportionately with fish landings across sites, hence indicating a probable direct correlation between mangrove wood harvested and its use in fish smoking. The different uses of mangrove wood were similar in all sites, but the quantities of wood extracted from different sites varied, with sites of high fish landings registering the highest fuel-wood turnover. It seemed that local people were unaware of the need to maintain ecosystem functions despite the close relationship between wood and fish harvesting, and their importance in ensuring the livelihood for local population in the study areas. From the revision of current management policies and field observations, we propose the development of adaptive management strategies aimed at improving policy, creating public awareness, and integrating local communities in the development of a sustainable management plan for the mangrove resources of Cameroon.","journal":"Tropical Conservation Science","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

To understand the effects of this activity on mangrove ecology, it is necessary to assess harvesting practices of local communities. Knowledge on those is scarce for this region; we therefore examined implications of gender roles on the sustainability of mangrove forests in the South West Region (SWR), Cameroon. Socio-economic surveys, focus group discussions and forest inventories were used for the assessments. Mangroves in the studied sites were dominated by Rhizophora racemosa. The Simpson's diversity index did not vary significantly between exploitation levels. The current harvesting style by women (compared with men) is characterised by a larger working area but closer to home and more seasonal, intensive harvesting of smaller trees. This enhances mangrove ecosystem degradation, whereby the effect is exacerbated because of the catalytic harvesting practices of men (less frequent, small scale, selective harvesting of larger trees). To help sustain mangroves in this region, further research on wood harvesting practices and implications for factors affecting growth is essential. To improve harvesting strategies, communities need to be provided with alternative sources of livelihood and educated on the values of mangroves and regeneration techniques.

Since the 1970s, various national and international actors have popularised marine protected areas (MPAs) as an effective tool for coastal conservation, tourism and even social empowerment. Scholars and practitioners however, overlook the different actors and complex institutions that frame and contest MPA design, implementation and outcomes. Pursuing apolitical perspectives and strategies in MPA governance and management, in turn, lead to continued environmental destruction and impoverished small-scale fishers. This paper describes the resources, power and relationship of key actors in MPA decision-making in four sites in northeastern Iloilo Province, Philippines. The paper explains that state-led, community-based and co-managed MPAs in the case study sites are socially constructed and contested. In such MPA spaces, actors have complex negotiations that have diverse and uncertain socio-political and ecological results. It is argued, however, that unless state and non-state actors link improved coastal ecosystem management, effective MPA governance and opportunities to enhance local livelihoods, then existing institutional arrangements will unlikely promote social justice and equity. In addition the major ecological effects of the Solar 1-Petron oil spill of August, 2006 are described and the potential implications of the disaster to the institutional resilience of MPA management systems are evaluated.","journal":"Journal of Coastal Research","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

We studied human-elephant conflict in two areas with contrasting scenarios of landuse and conflict, Kahalle and Yala. Kahalle was developed and settled under the Mahaweli irrigation project and the main agricultural practice was irrigated agriculture, with two annual growing seasons. The area was a mosaic of settlements, agriculture, and small forest patches with ill defined human- and elephant-use areas. Elephants ranged within the habitat mosaic year round, occupying remnant forest patches and raiding adjacent crops at night. In contrast, Yala was dominated by a large protected area complex, and the main agricultural methods were slash-and-burn agriculture and rain-fed paddy cultivation. Human- and elephant-use areas were well defined and segregated. The protected area provided elephants with a refuge and food during the rainy season, when the single annual crop was grown. During the dry season, elephants moved into slash-and-burn areas and utilized leftover crops and pioneer vegetation in fallow fields. The landuse pattern and agricultural practices in Yala facilitated co-existence, whereas that in Kahalle led to year round conflict. We suggest that areas managed according to traditional landuse practices should be part of an elephant conservation strategy, where people and elephants have to share resources.","journal":"Biodiversity and Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

J.","year":2001,"title":"Global habitat protection: Limitations of development interventions and a role for conservation performance payments","dAbstract":"Conservation biologists, policy makers, and citizens have identified the protection of native ecosystems in low-income nations as a global social objective. Among the more popular initiatives toward this objective is the use of development interventions in the peripheral areas of endangered ecosystems. Such interventions indirectly provide desirable ecosystem services by redirecting labor and capital away from activities that degrade ecosystems (e.g., agricultural intensification) and by encouraging commercial activities that supply ecosystem services as joint products (e.g., ecotourism). I examined the economics of such interventions and the available empirical evidence and concluded that development interventions are hindered by (1) the indirect and ambiguous conservation incentives that they generate, (2) the complexity of their implementation, and (3) their lack of conformity with the temporal and spatial dimensions of ecosystem conservation objectives. In contrast, paying individuals or communities directly for conservation performance may be a simpler and more effective approach. In recent years there has been widespread experimentation with contracting approaches to ecosystem conservation. Conservation contracting can (1) reduce the set of critical parameters that practitioners must affect to achieve conservation goals, (2) permit more precise targeting and more rapid adaptation over time, and (3) strengthen the links between individual well-being, individual actions, and habitat conservation, thus creating a local stake in ecosystem protection. In situations where performance payments are unlikely to work, indirect development interventions are also unlikely to work. Thus, despite the potential barriers to developing a system of conservation contracts in low-income nations, my analysis suggests that performance payments have the potential to improve the way in which ecosystems are conserved in these nations.","journal":"Conservation Biology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

However, the success of PAs in promoting biodiversity conservation depends on their integration to local and regional contexts, reducing and mitigating human impacts originating from buffer zones. Community perceptions affect interactions between residents and PAs, and thereby conservation effectiveness. Research at Tocantins state (northern Brazilian Cerrado), aimed to analyse local community perceptions of four PAs, discussing how different factors may influence these. Perceptions were assessed through standardized interviews applied to PA employees and 275 local inhabitants. There was modest community participation in PA establishment and management. Residents were aware of the PAs existence, but were unfamiliar with their goals. Length of residency and occupation of inhabitants influenced their PA perceptions, shaping different people-park relations in each of the four studied PAs. Involvement of local residents in PA planning and management represents a central strategy to strengthen local support for PAs over the long term. In those areas that still have settlements inside their boundaries, community relocation should follow a careful participatory process to avoid significant changes in local perceptions and attitudes towards these PAs, crucial for conserving Brazilian biodiversity.

Anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing and climate change increasingly threaten both the reef ecosystem and the livelihood security of the people that depend on the reefs. Adaptive management strategies are needed to adequately deal with these threats, but they require an understanding of the underlying drivers, which often originate and act on multiple levels. Using a social-ecological system approach, the coral reef fishery of the Spermonde Archipelago in South Sulawesi/Indonesia is assessed to identify key drivers and strategic leverage points for management. Under the influence of international markets and technological changes, several export-oriented fisheries have developed in the area that led to distinct subsequent peaks in fishing activity in a pattern of sequential marine resource exploitation. In response to stressors such as seasonality and overfishing of individual locations or species, a number of coping strategies have developed locally. These include extensive borrowing from fishing patrons, diversification of fishing methods, fishing migrations, and the crafting of local institutions to regulate fishing activity. However, the coping strategies hinder, and even decrease, the capacity of the system to adapt to future stressors and undermine the sustainability of the fishery. Potential strategies that target different levels of the fishery system in order to strengthen adaptive management are identified.

The Spermonde Archipelago off Southwest Sulawesi is one of the four major ornamental coral collection sites in Indonesia, the country supplying most corals in the trade. Management of the fishery remains ineffective, and overharvesting is widespread. Conservation strategies for marine resources increasingly emphasize the socioeconomic dimensions of resource use, yet little information is available on the livelihoods of fishermen involved in the ornamental fishery. Here, a first analysis of the livelihoods of coral fishermen in the Spermonde Archipelago is presented, along with a discussion of possibilities for future management interventions. The reef fishery of the study area is characterized by a high diversity of target organisms, with none of the fishermen relying exclusively on ornamental corals for income. Moreover, fishermen are organized in a tightly knit web of patron-client relationships, leaving little scope for them to initiate changes in livelihood strategies. The patron-client system emerged as a key institution of the fishery. In order to support sustainable marine resource use, management policies should simultaneously target the fishermen and their patrons as well as the regional coral trade network, broadening the livelihood portfolio of island communities and improving the regulation of the associated trade network.

Prominent among them are community-based management and the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). The overall poor performance of MPAs can be traced to a failure to effectively include local communities in the design and implementation of relevant measures. Recent efforts have incorporated aspects of community-based management into a hybrid form of management, which ideally builds upon existing local management practices. A key challenge lies in the development of appropriate frameworks that allow for the successful participation of local communities in management. A review of studies on MPA design and community-based marine resource management and fieldwork observations provides suggestions on how to address current socioeconomic shortcomings in MPA design and implementation, successfully involving local communities in order to provide a better local basis for effective larger MPA networks. A combination of MPA tools as the formal frame and community-based natural resource management as the adaptive core that recognizes local communities as allies, not aliens, is needed to develop successful conservation approaches.

{"author":"Few, R.","year":2001,"title":"Containment and counter-containment: planner/community relations in conservation planning","dAbstract":"Critical analyses of public involvement in conservation projects in developing countries commonly point toward imbalances of power between project agencies and communities and the persistence of top-down patterns of decision-making. Taking an actor-oriented research approach, this paper probes beneath the surface patterns to analyse the complex socio-political mechanisms at work in the negotiating arena represented by public participation in project planning. The discussion is based on a case study of community involvement in the planning of protected areas in Belize. Detailed analysis of the power relations and tactical interactions between different actors in the negotiating arenas revealed that planner/community relations in the case study were dominated by a process identified as 'containment'. Containment refers to a strategic management of public involvement by the planning agencies, and it hinged on three fundamental social actions: avoidance of conflict; exclusion of dissent; and control over knowledge and procedure. Actions by local stakeholders that served to undermine containment constitute 'counter-containment'. The paper discusses these mechanisms in depth, before developing a comparative analytical framework of containment and counter-containment to help explain disparities in planning progress between different sites.","journal":"Geographical Journal","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Fidelman, P.; Ekstrom, J. A.","year":2012,"title":"Mapping seascapes of international environmental arrangements in the Coral Triangle","dAbstract":"The . Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security (CTI), adopted recently in response to the degradation of coastal and marine environments in the Southeast Asia-Pacific's Coral Triangle, emphasises the need for using existing international and regional fora to promote implementation. Large-scale marine initiatives, including the CTI, very often must contend with a remarkably complex institutional system. This raises the question of whether and how such complexity can be conducive to marine resources management. To answer this question, this paper aims to better understand the governance context in which the CTI was established (i.e., map governance fragmentation/complexity), and explore how such a context may support the implementation of the CTI goals (i.e., examine normative interplay). To conduct this examination, it uses an objective method that allows users to view and explore institutional arrangements through a network approach. By documenting the system of existing institutions in the Coral Triangle, the study shows that the Coral Triangle governance system is illustrative of those of international environmental governance. It involves multiple policy domains, and features different institutional arrangements and variability in terms of geographical scope and main subject matter. Such a system is complex and fragmented, marked by jurisdiction and functional overlaps. The paper suggests interplay management, such as inter-institutional learning and enhancing institutional synergy, as a promising process to promote inter-institutional coordination.

Utilising data from a wider international study in Asia and the Pacific (Yencken et al., 2000), the paper uses findings from these two countries to illustrate the pervasiveness of global environmental concerns over local cultural influences in the construction of youth environmental attitudes in Australia and Brunei. Thus, young people in these countries, as they do in all parts of the Asia-Pacific region, have very similar levels of environmental awareness and knowledge, sources of environmental, beliefs, systems or world views about the environment, and levels of perceived control over environmental trends. They also have a shared desire for schools to do more in the area of environmental education. The paper concludes that much more effort needs to be made in certain areas. The first is to encourage teachers and others who have influence over young people to develop their own knowledge and skills to be able to teach environmental education effectively. The second is in the area of curriculum and pedagogical reform so that young people explore the many possible ways in which current systems can change to support sustainability, in which current lifestyles reflect these systems, and in which their own actions can contribute to a sustainable future.","journal":"Environmentalist","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

We used camera traps to detect jaguars, and social data were collected through informal interviews and 46 semi-structured and 106 structured interviews with community leaders and members. During June 2007-June 2008 camera traps registered two jaguars in the four study communities after 1,164 trap nights, with a photo-capture rate of 7.8 jaguar captures per 1,000 trap nights. Interviews documented 86 jaguar sightings since 1990. Despite some history of livestock predation, 68% of the interviewed farmers indicated jaguar presence was positive, 20% that jaguar presence was both positive and negative, and 12% thought jaguars were a negative presence. All of the respondents with negative attitudes had either owned cattle previously or lost cattle to predation. Despite ongoing risks to jaguars the emergence of community-conserved areas, local conservation initiatives, and a community-imposed hunting ban are supported by 93% of community members. An emerging culture of conservation in the study communities suggests there is an opportunity for jaguar conservation on community lands that should be explored elsewhere in jaguar range countries.

C.","year":2007,"title":"Understanding mental constructs of biodiversity: Implications for biodiversity management and conservation","dAbstract":"The participation of the public in environmental decision-making and management is increasingly seen as essential for the success of conservation initiatives. Ecological scientists and conservation practitioners have, however, argued that a lack of understanding of biodiversity issues by the public is a barrier to their effective participation in decision-making processes. These arguments are often based on studies where scientific knowledge is used as the sole measure of public understanding of biodiversity, and therefore fail to account for individuals' constructs of biodiversity and related issues such as biodiversity management. We examined individuals' mental constructs of biodiversity, and their conceptual contexts, through a series of focus group discussions with members of the general public in Scotland. To gain a fuller picture of public understanding of biodiversity, we distinguished between mental associations with the term 'biodiversity', and the meanings associated with biodiversity-related concepts independent of scientific terminology. We found participants to express rich mental concepts of biodiversity, irrespective of their scientific knowledge. These included notions of balance, food chains and human-nature interactions, and showed strong normative dimensions that were used to define desirable or ideal states of nature. These concepts of biodiversity were, in turn, strongly related to their attitudes towards how best to manage biodiversity. This study highlights that a better understanding of individuals' mental constructs of biodiversity, which are linked to their attitudes towards biodiversity management, is essential for the design of biodiversity-related policies that are supported by the public.

The developing countries should therefore be given economic and scientific assistance in their efforts to exploit and conserve their genetic resources. Synergy effects exist between the conservation of the biological diversity and the interests of agriculture in general because a loss of genetic variability would endanger the future basis of human nutrition which also has to be secured through conventional breeding and modern gene technology. The global conservation of biological diversity depends to a great extent on a reduction in the rate of population growth, a more sustainable exploitation of the available resources, the establishment of large protected areas where human influence is either reduced to a minimum or completely excluded and last but not least an improved cooperation on an international basis (according to the reports of the IUPAC Conference on Biodiversity and Bioressources, Phuket, Thailand, 1997).","journal":"Schutz und Nutzung der BiodiversitÃ¤t - Wissenschaftliche und politische Aspekte","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

A case study exploring motivations for participation in payments for ecosystem services in Uganda","dAbstract":"A key question in the literature on payments for ecosystem services (PES) is how payments incentivize conservation action and, in particular, how they interact with other motivations, including motivations for environmental stewardship. Related to this question are concerns about the temporal sustainability of PES: what happens when payments cease and whether a 'no pay, no care' environmental ethic is fostered. I present empirical research from a case study in western Uganda, where forest-adjacent communities are paid in exchange for planting trees on private lands, for carbon sequestration. The study demonstrates the range of values people have for trees in the landscape and the range of motivations for participating in PES schemes. However, the analysis shows that payments are clearly the main motivation for involvement, except in one area where people are more motivated by aesthetic and existence values for trees. Given the widespread importance of money in motivating involvement, I investigate the profitability of participation over time. This profitability analysis, in combination with qualitative data on perceptions of, and plans for, the future, contributes to understanding the temporal sustainability of PES. I draw on various strands of evidence to argue that the way participants prioritize payments may constitute a threat to the long-term maintenance of PES activities, particularly in situations such as in this case study, in which there is a mismatch between payments and contract length.

People have differentiated abilities to benefit from ecosystem services, and the framework places emphasis on access to services, which may constrain the poorest more than aggregate availability. Distinctions are also made between categories of ecosystem service in their contribution to wellbeing, provisioning services and cash being comparatively easy to control. The framework gives analytical space for understanding the contribution of payments for ecosystem services to wellbeing, as distinct from direct ecosystem services. It also highlights the consumption of ecosystem services by external actors, through land appropriation or agricultural commodities. Important conceptual distinctions are made between poverty reduction and prevention, and between human response options of adaptation and mitigation in response to environmental change. The framework has applications as a thinking tool, laying out important relationships such that an analyst could identify and understand these in a particular situation. Most immediately, this has research applications, as a basis for multidisciplinary, policy-relevant research, but there are also applications to support practitioners in pursuing joint policy objectives of environmental sustainability and poverty alleviation.

Neoliberal Conservation and the Evasion of Inequality","dAbstract":"Recently, a number of prominent conservationists have declared the last quarter century of global efforts to unite conservation and development through so-called integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) an overwhelming failure, asserting that there are likely to be irreconcilable trade-offs between environmental preservation and enhancing human well-being that future policy will have to take into account. I suggest, however, that such trade-offs may be less an inherent feature of the world than an artefact of the neoliberal governance model upon which the global conservation movement increasingly relies, as embodied in the ICDP approach. In eschewing questions of resource redistribution and instead depending on economic growth to address social inequality, neoliberal conservation strategies often paradoxically force into opposition the very conservation and development interests they ostensibly seek to reconcile. This thesis is illustrated through discussion of Costa Rica's Osa Peninsula, a celebrated biodiversity hotspot where conservation interventions increasingly emphasize neoliberal market mechanisms designed to incentivize preservation by demonstrating the economic value of in situ natural resources.

Over one hundred million people living in its coastal zones use this biodiversity to support their livelihoods. Hundreds of millions more derive nutritious food directly from the regionâ€²s marine resources and through local, regional and global trade. Biodiversity and its values to society are threatened by demographic and habitat change, rising demand, intensive harvesting and climate change. In partnership with international conservation organisations and development funders, the governments of the regionâ€²s six countries have come together to develop the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security.

We interviewed 2,035 households in 117 villages at four sites, recording income, consumption, education, health indicators and social capital, and village characteristics such as distance to markets, distance to park boundaries, and land cover within a 5-km radius. Our results indicated that closed rainforest coverage was greater around park than control villages and that this difference was associated with a greater reliance of park households on forest resources. However, we found no systematic differences in most livelihood measures between park and control households. Instead, the relationship between household livelihood measures and proximity to parks varied in idiosyncratic ways between sites, suggesting that determinants of human welfare are highly localized and cannot be generalized to larger spatial scales.","journal":"Oryx","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

In order to explore the potential social resilience of marine-dependent livelihoods to environmental change, interviews with fishers and marine-based tourism operators in the Caribbean island of Anguilla were undertaken, to identify the impacts of hurricane events on marine livelihoods, the perceptions of resource-users and their potential adaptability to future change. For both sectors of resource-users, there is evidence that they have diversified livelihoods to achieve financial security, which may provide resilience to future climate related impacts or resource variability. In addition, specific behavioural changes that have been developed following previous hurricane events, e.g. removal of fish pots during hurricane months, or bringing boats to shore, indicate fishers' flexibility to changing conditions. However, strong personal and cultural attachment to occupations, particularly among fishers, may hinder resilience. Additionally, the reliance of all of these marine resource-users on the climate-dependent tourism industry may undermine their capacity to cope with future environmental change. Many of these problems are common throughout the Caribbean, as thousands of marine-dependent livelihoods are vulnerable to marine degradation and climate change impacts. Urgent attention is therefore required to support the development of adaptive, sustainable management of marine resources that may enhance resilience to environmental change. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Today the ecological bounty of this region is threatened by the expansion of settled agriculture, including the proliferation of rubber plantations. In the current conception of REDD+, landscapes involving swidden qualify almost automatically for replacement by other land-use systems because swiddens are perceived to be degraded and inefficient with regard to carbon sequestration. However, swiddening in some cases may be carbon-neutral or even carbon positive, compared with some other types of land-use systems. In this paper we describe how agricultural policies and institutions have affected land use in the region over the last several decades and the impact these policies have had on the livelihoods of swiddeners and other smallholders. We also explore whether incentivizing transitions away from swiddening to the cultivation of rubber will directly or reliably produce carbon gains. We argue that because government policies affect how land is used, they also influence carbon emissions, farmer livelihoods, environmental services, and a host of other variables. A deeper and more systematic analysis of the multiple consequences of these policies is consequently necessary for the design of successful REDD+ policies in MMSEA, and other areas of the developing world. REDD+ policies should be structured not so much to 'hold the forest boundary' but to influence the types of land-use changes that are occurring so that they support both sustainable livelihoods and environmental services, including (but not limited to) carbon.

Two adjectives can sum up the characteristics of pelagic species: variability and instability. Analyses of the relationships between small pelagic fish and their physical environment at different time-scales illustrate the complexity of the interplay between exploitation and environmental impacts. How small pelagic fish species are positioned and related within the trophic web suggests that these species play a central role in the functioning and dynamics of upwelling ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the sustainable exploitation of small pelagic fisheries through appropriate management, focusing on the resilience to exploitation, a comparison of different management options and regulatory mechanisms.

{"author":"Friis-Hansen, E.","year":1999,"title":"The socio-economic dynamics of farmers' management of local plant genetic resources: A framework for analysis with examples from a Tanzanian case study","dAbstract":"This paper discusses the debate around farmers' management of local plant genetic resources. It seek to develop a theoretical framework for analysing farmers management of plant genetic resources using examples from fieldwork carried out in 1995-1997 among farmers in Tanzania with a focus on the 1994/95 growing season. The study is part of a research programme involving several institutions and coordinated by CDR, titled Sustainable Agriculture in Semi-Arid Tanzania (SASA). Two very different systems of plant genetic resources management have developed in most developing countries, including Tanzania. One is a formal science-based plant genetic resource management system consisting of state institutions for plant conservation, breeding and seed multiplication and distribution. The other is an informal plant genetic resource management system based on farmers' local knowledge. Neither of the two plant genetic resource management systems are adequate for ensuring sustainable plant genetic resource use by small-scale farmers. The research suggests that the following three elements must be included when studying farmers management of local plant genetic resources: (i) an understanding of the concept of local knowledge vis a vis scientific knowledge, (ii) a conceptualisation of farmers institutions for managing plant genetic resources, and (iii) an analysis of the social, gender and cultural contexts of local plant genetic resource management. Farmer's local experimentation and collection of knowledge are not based on scientific theoretical models, but emerge from strong interests in knowledge with practical local application and which provides options for improving peoples' livelihood. Local technical knowledge, skills and capacities to manage plant genetic resources are embedded in the cultural, ecological and sociological context of the community. In the case of plant genetic resource management, such local knowledge evolves around the crop cycle and the three main groups of management practices are (i) seed selection, (ii) treatment and storage of seed and (iii) seed multiplication and exchange. The strength of local seed selection is its ability to adapt varieties to the specific cultural, economic and social requirements of local farming systems. Seed is often, but not always, stored separate from the harvested crop and a range of local seed treatment and storage techniques is used by farmers to ensure viable seed for future planting seasons. While most households are self-sufficient with seed of frequently used varieties, new or less common varieties are frequently exchanged within or between communities. Community seed exchange also serves as a back-up source of seed in years of deficit harvest or following droughts or other emergencies. Local institutions for managing plant genetic resources only seldom take the shape of organisations and commonly consist of shared norms and practices within a community or ethnic group of people. While local institutions for natural resource management are often associated with conflict over access and use, plant genetic resources are renewable and therefore are seldom the cause of conflict over access at the local level. Plant genetic resource management is largely the product of social processes and institutions in the community level. Limitations to local plant genetic resource management include, (i) constraints in terms of knowledge about genetics (lack of support from scientists), (ii) limited access to globally or nationally available plant genetic resources, and (iii) declining capacity of local resource management institutions. There are potentials for synergy if the weak links between the two systems of plant genetic resource management were enhanced to develop a participatory partnership, which takes advantage of the comparative strengths of each of the two systems.","journal":"CDR Working Paper","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

A conceptual framework for the analysis of biodiversity change, local human communities, and PA management was put forward, accordingly. Under the framework, we investigated the economic status, livelihood activities, biodiversity use and perceptions of local communities, and the land use history in Wolong Biosphere Reserve, southwestern China through household survey and document review in order to gain a better understanding of the complexity of PA management. According to the land use history, the preservation of agro-biodiversity, and the raising of productivity, ecological rehabilitation and the regulation of the human pressures are indispensable in the management of the reserve. Livelihood activities and the perceptions of local communities were largely determined by the socioeconomic background, which has important implications in solving the conflicts or incompatibilities in the reserve. In Wolong Biosphere Reserve, it is beneficial to support local farmers in solving their socioeconomic problems such as the overabundance of labor force and the lack of livelihood alternatives. Without this, there will be scarcely any effective biodiversity conservation and successful reserve management in the long term.","journal":"Environmental Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The internal heterogeneity of agroecosystems and links between agrobiodiversity and peasant livelihood strategies have been little explored. We studied utilisation and on-farm conservation strategies for both wild and cultivated plants consumed in tropical montane agroecosystems in a Hani nationality village, Daka, Xishuangbanna, SW China. We undertook a botanical survey in 99 plots together with annual questionnaire interviews with 60% of households from 1998 to 2005. For wild plants, the main uses are for ethnomedicine (53.4%), wood (13.5%) and as vegetables (6.8%). For cultivated plants, the main uses are for ethnomedicine (27.9%), as vegetables (19.2%) and as ornamentals (16.3%). Households often use low-quality timber species because of deforestation. The proportion of fuelwood collected from fallow land has declined continuously, whereas collection of rubber branches and Cassia siamea plantations have increased. The origin and changes in cultivated species in homegardens, swidden fields and rubber plantations were analysed. Indigenous knowledge of plant resources has decreased, with habitat loss and substitution for exotic species, which have a double-edged impact on biodiversity conservation. Management regulations and on-farm conservation strategies for native plant resources are discussed.","journal":"International Journal of Biodiversity Science and Management","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Two critical issues are to what extent these factors play a role, and how to enhance local adaptation through government support. We investigated these issues through a case study of two pastoral communities on the Tibetan Plateau in China employing an analytical framework to understand local climate adaptation processes. We concluded that LEK and community-based institutions improve adaptation outcomes for Tibetan pastoralists through shaping and mobilizing resource availability to reduce risks. Higher-level institutions and policies contribute by providing resources from outside communities. There are dynamic interrelationships among these factors that can lead to support, conflict, and fragmentation. Government policy could enhance local adaptation through improvement of supportive relationships among these factors. While central government policies allow only limited room for overt integration of local knowledge/ institutions, local governments often have some flexibility to buffer conflicts. In addition, government policies to support market-based economic development have greatly benefited adaptation outcomes for pastoralists. Overall, in China, there are still questions over how to create innovative institutions that blend LEK and community-based institutions with government policy making.

During 1998-2004, we conducted an annual survey of households in the two villages, Baka and Daka, which represent different stages in the shift from a subsistence agroecosystem to a rubber plantation-dominated system in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. Significant negative correlations were observed between gross income and dependence on NTFPs-generated income in both Baka and Daka villages (P=0.029 in Baka and P=0.028 in Daka), which is supporting evidence that poorer households derive greater benefits from NTFPs than do wealthy households. When the rubber price dropped during 1998-2001. the NTFPs income of Baka increased greatly from US$59.10 to US$145 per household, or from 6.4% to 26.6% of household gross income. In contrast, in Daka village, NTFPs income increased by insignificant amounts of US$1.6 per household in 1998 to US$23.8 in 2001, but this was compensated by an increase in income from off-farm work of US$11 to US$147 (an increase from 1.8% to 16.2% of gross income per household) from 1998 to 2001 in Daka. NTFPs retained important roles both in alleviating risk associated with monoculture price fluctuations and in generating income for relatively poor people.

Contribution of different NTFPs to cash income and different seasonal access to NTFPs between Baka and Daka were analysed. There were significant differences in income and role of NTFPs per household between Baka and Daka related to different access to: NTFPs in forests, labour and market sales in different seasons. In Baka, the ranking of NTFP income was: fungi, wild vegetables, bamboo shoot in 2000 and 2001. Differences in gender and generational involvement in NTFP sales was also examined. For example, households without a son, as well as those with a female householder depended more on income from NTFPs and less on income from rubber than other households. Resource use patterns between relatively wealthy and poor households were also analysed. Wealthy households sold 2.50 +/- 0.50 types while poor households sold 2.08 +/- 0.26 NTFPs. The Gini coefficient of gross income per household for Baka in recent years was 0.393, increasing to 0.414 without NTFPs. The Gini coefficient of gross income for Daka in recent years was 0.291, increasing to 0.292 without NTFPs, showing the different role of NTFPs in mitigating wealth inequality in the two villages.","journal":"International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Across Asia and stretching to Gibraltar and Northern Africa, macaques form a substantial tourist attraction as their ranges become increasingly coincident with human use zones. Residing in or as tourist attractions, macaques frequently generate economic benefits to local humans and compete with them for habitat and specific resources. In addition, health conflicts may emerge from increased overlap and interactions between humans and macaques. There is only a handful of studies on the impact, structure, context, and cultural ecology of macaque tourist sites. We provide a general overview of 2 macaque tourist sites, one in Padangtegal, Bali, Indonesia and one in Gibraltar. Qualitative assessment reveals variability in behavioral, ecological, economic, and politically relevant facets of macaque tourism. Specifically, differences in aggression during interactions, potential health dangers, economic factors, and local human perceptions between Padangtegal and Gibraltar suggest that qualitative assessments can assist in our construction of broader models and conceptualizations of the interaction context.

While large areas of forestlands were designated as national forest reserves, many forests were actually converted into farmlands. This article focuses on the institutional and administrative aspects of the national forest reserve system, the core institution of forest conservation in Thailand, and examines the institutional structure, historical process mostly since the 1960s, and procedures of the national forest reserve system and related policies at both in national and local levels. The national forest reserve system institutionally lacked sufficient mechanisms for enforcement and, because local people's land use was not investigated in advance, the contradiction arose that large numbers of people resided and cultivated land in national forest reserves. While occasionally policies to give cultivation rights to these people were carried out, designation of national forest reserves continued without any structural amendments, and the contradiction was perpetuated. In the procedures of forest protection units, the sole organ for on-the-spot policing, breaches were sometimes overlooked in order to balance the regulations and actual situation of the local people's livelihood. Forest officers are basically faithful to their tasks, even though they know the system itself substantially fails to function. But they also behave in realistic and flexible ways in applying principles that are far from appropriate to the actual situations they encounter. Institutionalization and activation of such an unrealistic system can also be interpreted as creating a wide range of discretion, which has enabled realistic forest conservation to be carried out as far as possible in the prevailing social or political climate without much friction. In order to argue for a suitable forest conservation system, this point must be taken into consideration.","journal":"Southeast Asian Studies","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The Land and Forest Allocation Policy was introduced in the early 1990s as a means of legitimately recognizing the customary rights of local communities to use and manage land and forest resources. We examine the policy from the viewpoint of decentralized resource management and, through three case studies conducted by the National University of Laos, how it works in practice. The studies were conducted in Vientiane, central Lao PDR, and indicate gaps between the expected goals of land reform and actual practice. The study also shows the varying impacts of the allocation policy on local resource use and household livelihoods in different villages.

It compares the impact on livelihoods, conservation and governance of the different institutional frameworks through which ecotourism services are delivered. The central focus is directed to the region in which the world famous Iwokrama Rainforest project was established with widespread institutional support. The outcomes for ecotourism developed by this project are compared with the operations of a private company and a local community-based ecotourism enterprise. The North Rupununi area is inhabited by Amerindians who have always utilised rainforest resources for their livelihoods but are gradually being absorbed into the global economy. They remain by far the poorest communities in Guyana but there are powerful claims that ecotourism can materially assist in improving their livelihoods. At the same time there are strong pressures through agencies such as the Iwokrama Reserve to maintain pristine rainforest ecologies and therefore the agencies argue that an ecotourism approach can be used to satisfy both conservation and livelihood demands.

While the policy clearly emphasizes the conservation of forests without further degradation, the actions contradict the policy. The people's perception that forests are critical to their livelihoods was instrumental in getting the public involved in fighting for their conservation. Many Kenyans were able to link forests with values such as water conservation, income generation, flood control, rainfall, food and medicine, grazing lands during the dry season, tourism development and biodiversity conservation. Their awareness ensured that public utilities and environmentally crucial resources would not be exploited irresponsibly. The Kenyan case demonstrates that through capacity building by NGOs and civil society movements, people can acquire the strength to influence decisions made regarding their resources. It is also evident that it is imperative to involve all interested parties in decisions that affect their livelihoods as a way of avoiding conflicts over management of natural resources. In conclusion, the case of Kenya provides a lesson to those who make decisions that are detrimental to forests: they cannot avoid the spotlight of transparency and accountability.","journal":"Unasylva","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Gadd, M. E.","year":2005,"title":"Conservation outside of parks: Attitudes of local people in Laikipia, Kenya","dAbstract":"Conflict between wildlife and people can erode local support for conservation. Wildlife-based benefits are intended to offset costs and encourage tolerance or stewardship, but where the linkage between benefits and wildlife is not understood, benefits may be ineffective at bolstering conservation. In Laikipia, Kenya, wildlife and areas devoted to wildlife are on the increase, but most residents still suffer losses to wildlife and derive minimal benefits. The elephant situation is particularly problematic because elephants may compete with livestock for resources, raid people's crops, and chase and kill livestock and people. Although most unprotected elephant range in East Africa is in semi-arid rangelands occupied by pastoralists, previous research has emphasized agricultural, not pastoral or agri-pastoral conflicts. Between 1999 and 2002, interviews were conducted in Laikipia District to examine whether pastoralists also experience conflict, and to determine whether wildlife conservation provided appreciable benefits to residents, or fostered pro-conservation attitudes among residents. Three properties, Endana, Koija and Mpala, were selected to include the two primary land uses in Laikipia (livestock and agriculture) and two levels of wildlife-based benefits (indirect benefits and direct benefits from a locally-owned tourism operation). People were negative about many aspects of local wildlife conservation, especially animals that raided crops or were dangerous. Fundamental differences in attitudes were attributable to primary land use; within ethnic groups, people practising agriculture were less tolerant of elephants than people practising pastoralism. Despite evidence that elephants may compete with livestock for forage, ecological competition was not a primary concern among cattle-keeping people. In communities that received indirect benefits from tourism or wildlife, the connection between wildlife and employment or aid in kind was usually overlooked. Unlike elsewhere in Africa, education and wealth did not correlate with positive attitudes towards wildlife because the tourism programme was improving the situation and the outlook of people lacking education and material wealth. Pastoral people with indirect financial benefits expressed positive attitudes towards elephants for aesthetic reasons, while pastoral people with direct benefits cited financial rewards derived from tourism but attributed aesthetic values to living with elephants. The programme in the pastoral community receiving benefits was exemplary in that benefits were tangible, and the participants appreciated the linkage between benefits and active conservation. Land conversion from pastoralism to agriculture threatens elephant survival, not only in terms of habitat loss, but also in terms of lost tolerance among people who have shifted to farming.

Six of the 14 megadiversity countries that house 60-70% of the species in the world are located on this region. Unfortunately, the number of environmental professionals in Latin America is extremely small. Furthermore, most of them have no postgraduate degrees and are unacquainted with general research methodology and recently developed concepts and tools. In addition, many speak no English and have no way to communicate with colleagues in other parts of the world. In collaboration with Latin American colleagues, universities, government agencies, and nongovernment organizations, I have been developing an integrated field course titled \"Design and Analyses of Projects to Manage Biological Diversity\" to address these problems. To date, we have conducted nine courses in seven countries. The courses consist of five complementary components that are addressed sequentially: (1) conceptual framework, (2) critical analysis of personal projects, (3) methodological tools, (4) analytical tools, and (5) integration. I also discuss the elements that contribute to the success of these courses. Powerful elements in the course are the presentation, critical analysis, and constructive discussion of participants' real conservation projects. In addition, the careful matching of participants with instructors, subject matter, and learning environment has resulted in a great learning experience for everyone involved. Because of the lack of graduate training in conservation-related disciplines and the more general pitfalls associated with teaching science, there is a great demand in Latin America for integrated field courses.

Integrated into the global market, MAs have since expanded along the Chilean coast, involving thousands of small-scale artisanal fishers. This paper analyses how economic criteria relates to social and ecological performance of Chilean MAs, by applying TURFs, commons and co-management theory to two cases: MAs PeÃ±uelas and Chigualoco. To collect and analyse data Participatory Rural Appraisal tools, interviews and official statistics and reports were used. Our results show that MAs' economic benefits are connected to fluctuations on the global market. Adapting to changing world market prices then becomes paramount. TURFs' main goal is ecological conservation, but achieving this seems to depend on meeting fishers' livelihoods; failure to do so likely results in failure to meet conservation objectives. A serious weakness of the Chilean TURFs system is that it does not pay enough attention to fishers' livelihoods or to the global market context. Furthermore, there is a strong relationship between good economic benefits and social sustainability. But irrespective of economic performance, fisher organizations have been empowered and gained increased resource control with the TURFs system. At policy level, a differentiated and more flexible system could be more suitable for existing heterogeneous MAs and their particular economic, social and ecological challenges. For improved economic sustainability and resource conservation, a system with multiplespecies managing MAs could be promoted as well. Finally, to enhance theory of commons, co-management and TURFs, we argue for greater acknowledgement of TURFs' social benefits in addition to economic assessments. More attention should also be paid to global market conditions of which MAs are dependent and in which they are embedded: macrostructures that are seldom considered in the analyses.

The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Convention) embodies this collaborative paradigm by suggesting that people and local governments can be collective stewards for the \"wise use\" of wetlands on which they depend for water resources and livelihoods. Although collaborative approaches are increasingly recommended to govern large and complex mountain waterscapes across multiple jurisdictions, recent international case study comparisons highlight the site-specific nature of institutional design and the effect that changing social relations and overlapping or conflicting rights and boundaries have on promised collaborative outcomes. This article illustrates the usefulness of a recently developed community-based natural resource management comparative framework for assessing the feasibility of collaboratively governing a proposed Ramsar wetland in the Southern Andes of Ecuador across multiple communities and jurisdictional boundaries. By using data from a rapid ethnographic assessment, US and Ecuadorian students and faculty found local and institutional support for wetland protection. The framework's preconditions were useful in identifying conflicts among and within communities, and among agency rules and resources; these conflicts could limit the feasibility of community-based and collaborative management unless coordination authority is clarified, especially at the proposed transboundary scale. This study showed that increasing attention to land tenure conflicts and institutional frameworks is needed for any collaborative governance design to be sustainable, which confirms political ecology findings.","journal":"Mountain Research and Development","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

However, recreation and tourism planning especially in protected areas; often exist in seclusion from the elements that constitute social, environmental and economic aspects of the area. Thus, conflicts may arise between park management and the community such as conflict between different user groups and competing usage of the same scarce resource which eventually lead to much serious problems such as environmental degradation. Community participation in decision making is one approach to establish a sense of belonging that is important for general well-being and support sustainable development. This could bring positive outcome and active participation would enable park management and the authorities to develop new attractions in the park and offer more sustainable forms of recreation and tourism which suit the people. However, the ability to maintain a healthy environment and economy and to pursue a participatory democracy requires effective management of public involvement. In addition, it also requires understanding not only the conditions that may have the potential to create conflicts but most importantly is to comprehend what are the conditions that can promote a cooperative relationship among the local people and the park management and authorities.

Most of them are natural growth forests with well-developed vegetation, which gives them significant biodiversity value. Often, they do not only provide forest products and regulate water flows and micro- climate, but also show great cultural values to the local community. Semi-structured interview with key informants was used to investigate the attitude and perception of local community concerning about ecosystem services of CPFs in three villages in Southeast China. The sampling method was multi-stage stratified random sampling method, a total 152 questionnaires were available and the respondent rate was 98. 7%. (1) We found that 81. 6% respondents were satisfied with ecosystem services provided by CPFs. These ecosystem services seemed important to local residents which were the motivation of local community to protect the forests. Air improvement, conservation water and aesthetic value were considered important and satisfied with respondents. Ecotourism which was not so satisfied and aesthetic value were considered to be improved in the future. Besides, percentage of respondents prioritizing the services which they consider important had significant positive correlation with services they satisfied. This indicated the services they considered important have been protected better and provided services to villagers and human well-being. (2) CPFs preserve water, moisture soil, abate flood, clean air, and maintain traditional culture and aesthetic value, although providing timber are not the main aim. Only 26. 3% respondents could get income from CPFs, particularly village with ecotourism for providing services for tourists. 40. 6% respondents could get forests products, for instance, wild herb, mushrooms, bamboo and timber. However, 90. 1% respondents could get forest products from other forests mainly for firewood and timber. (3) The enthusiasm of the villagers to protect the CPFs was high. 70. 4% of the respondents were willing to manage (WTM) CPFs, and WTM was affected by distance to CPFs and family income through logistic regression. 38. 9% of the respondents were willing to pay (WTP) to maintain the ecosystem services, and WTP was also affected by distance to CPFs and WTM. Willingness to pay for CPFs was lower than willingness to manage, because they are poor to maintain daily expense. Respondents who were not willing to pay tend to willing to manage, and the management frequency of men was higher than women. However, WTO and WTM had no significant relationship with age, satisfaction of CPFs, educational level, age and gender. (4) CPFs help to conserve the biodiversity and ecosystem services, and local communities are willing to manage and preserve the forests since they benefit from the ecosystem services especially cultural services. Thus, we recommend government to enhance the cognition of ecosystem services of CPFs to promote the protective ideas of villagers. Also, traditional knowledge and informal regulations are needed to be integrated into formal protection strategy. At last, other ways would dedicate to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, for instance: hire local males to manage the CPFs, make villages surrounded by CPFs. The management based on traditional belief and culture combined with informal regulation, which is not a panacea, will contribute to long term protective strategy of rural area.","journal":"Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Twenty-three indicators were used for evaluation: six biophysical indicators that largely measured the status of capture fisheries and coastal habitats; eight socioeconomic indicators that largely assessed the economic status and the perceptions of coastal communities; and nine governance indicators that measured the various facets of MPA management. Key lessons learned indicate the need to correlate the perceptions of coastal stakeholders with scientific findings as some perceptions did not reflect the results of biophysical surveys.

Networks and rules that foster that collective action have been defined as social capital. However, their causal link is still not fully understood. We use social network analysis to assess social capital, decision-making, and collective action in a forest-based common pool resource management in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve (Chiapas, Mexico). Our research analyzes the productive networks and the evolution of coffee groups in one community. The network shows some centrality, with richer landholders tending to occupy core positions and poorer landless peasants occupying peripheral ones. This has fostered the community's environmentally oriented development but has also caused internal conflicts. Market requirements have shaped different but complementary productive networks, where organic coffee commercialization is the main source of bridging ties, which has resulted in more connectivity and resilience. Conservation attitudes, along with the institutional setting of the community, have promoted collective action.

The results illustrate the fast adoption of palm plantations due to salient improvements in the economic return to effort. The change was led by richer households, although communal structures have allowed the middle income households to participate in the process. While palm producers do not tend to have beans and corn subsistence plots, landless poorer members have been left out of palm activities, basically remaining as subsistence farmers.

However, PES have raised some concerns on the commodification of nature and the potential replacement of non-chrematistic forms of valuing ecosystems. This article evaluates PES and ICDPs in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, by analyzing the programs' fund allocation, examining conservation perceptions based on 731 structured interviews and presenting a detailed assessment of ICDP/PES preferences in a community with the longest participation in both schemes. People receiving PES tend to make the future of conservation contingent on monetary and utilitarian reasons, this preference increasing with the number of years receiving PES. These are preferred for their directness and short-term results, although raising concerns about the little social capital they generate. ICDPs are appreciated for arising environmental awareness, being linked with long term conservation, productive capacity and social capital building. Negative perceptions of ICDPs are related to past economic failures. Our results suggest that the real issue is not PES vs. ICDPs but how to combine them to find the proper sequence while reinforcing intrinsic value-based attitudes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Different inefficient situations have been described, like lack of additionality, where payments are given for practices that would have been adopted anyway. Trade-offs between efficiency and equity of PES have usually emerged as well. In this paper we assess the equity, additionality and stakeholders' perceptions of a PES scheme in a Mexican community inside a Biosphere Reserve. We applied structured interviews to all adults, a total of 66 people from 31 households. Our results show a dual response in equity and additionality, depending on land tenure. PES have an egalitarian effect within landowners and landless groups, but it broadens the gap between them. Additionality is low for landowners and high for the landless people in the community, even though the former are the ones with full decision over the land. Although the scheme does not seem efficient under the classical PES paradigm, it is perceived as a reward, reinforcing conservation attitudes even though most of the interviewees claim it to be insufficient.

{"author":"Gatzweiler, F. W.","year":2008,"title":"Beyond economic efficiency in biodiversity conservation","dAbstract":"This paper aims at explaining the importance of the democracy stance as compared to the efficiency stance in order to achieve the conservation of biodiversity. While the efficiency stance only refers to the realm of relatively simple systems, individual rationality, and instrumental values, the complexity stance transcends these boundaries into the realm of complex systems, social rationality and intrinsic values. I argue that if biodiversity is not only regarded as a resource but also a systemic condition, the task of biodiversity conservation is impossible to achieve in economically efficient ways only, because (a) it is impossible to come to a (fully informed) complete account of all values, (b) intrinsic values are involved which exclude themselves from being accounted for in economically efficient terms, and (c) biodiversity conservation can be regarded as an end in itself instead of only a means towards the end of human well-being. The point I raise is, that in order to cope with biodiversity conservation in its entirity we need to choose value articulating institutions which take better account of intrinsic values or even feelings of people who are ultimately part of the same system and may feel that their existence should not be justified on the grounds of economic efficiency. It is how we choose to perceive people and biodiversity that determines choices of how to conserve biodiversity and invest in peoples conservation capabilities.

It was established in 2003 in order to protect Lake Ag-Gel and the surrounding semi-desert landscape. To date, detailed information on local people's livelihoods was not available. Against the background of modern protected area management the present paper analyses the socio-economic situation, and in particular the land use and resulting conflicts in the vicinity of Ag-Gel National Park. The analysis is base d on Rapid Rural Appraisal techniques and focused on semi-structured interviews with the sedentary population of the study area. The situation of the population and the agricultural sector in the study area has been subject to the following three processes: the political and economical transformation, the resulting agrarian reform and the consequences of conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Over 90% of the sedentary population are internally displaced persons (IDPs) of the territorial conflict. The majority of people earns a living from subsis tence farming, especially livestock husbandry. Grazing, especially overgrazing within the national park was identified as the main land use conflict. In orde r to accommodate the different land use interests, a zonation concept for the national park as well as the creation of a buffer zone outside the park are suggested. To prevent further impoverishment of the affected population, compensation of incurred losses and alternative methods of earning income become necessary.

Management of NTFPs through CFUGs is an important poverty-reduction strategy in rural Nepal. National policy documents encourage management of NTFPs by CFUGs for commercial purposes, particularly by involving marginalized communities. It is therefore important to understand the existing mechanisms of their involvement. We followed a case study approach and collected data through key informant interviews, focus group discussions, formal and informal discussions, participant observations, and study of secondary data, such as the constitutions and operational plans of the CFUGs. Because institutional arrangements varied across the 3 study CFUGs, the ability of marginalized people to benefit from the commercial management of NTFPs also differed. Results suggest that the involvement of external agencies, and the consequent conducting of NTFP-based pro-poor programs, positively influences commercial management of NTFPs and minimizes elite domination. Likewise, inclusion of representatives of marginalized people in the CFUG executive committees empowers them to lobby with external agencies for pro-poor programs. Furthermore, the geographic location of the community forest limits the involvement of external agencies and marketing of NTFPs. Therefore, because members of CFUGs in remote areas are heavily dependent on collection and sale of NTFPs for their livelihoods, we suggest increasing the focus of external agencies in such areas and including marginalized people in CFUG executive committees.

A study was conducted amongst 10 villages in the Olokemeji area of Oyo State, Nigeria using standardized interviews of 200 household heads. The oil boom of the 1970s in Nigeria drove many male heads of households in the study area to the cities, but the collapse of the urban unskilled labour market in the 1980s brought men back to the villages. However, by 1990, renewed dominance of female-headed households in the study area has followed further male emigration. Changing roles of women in managing the forest environment are indicated over the three time periods and I argue that female-headed households attempt to conserve and improve the state of the environment more than their male counterparts. This is achieved through the cultivation of less nutrient-demanding crops such as cassava and yam, and using environmentally-friendly farming systems such as terracing and taungya.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

In this connection, this paper focuses on the roles of local communities in the management of protected ecosystems using the proposed Abuja national park as a case study. Based on the analysis of the results of a socio-economic survey of the communities in the study area, the paper argues that the sustainable conservation of the proposed park can only be achieved if a management scheme that will integrate, empower and involve the local communities in the planning and implementation of the park management programme is put in place.

We find that community grazing land management contributes to more sustainable use of the resource and alleviation of feed shortage. Most collective action is locally initiated and is organized at village level. Collective action for grazing land management may be more beneficial and more effective in areas with intermediate population, higher social capital, and lower heterogeneity in oxen ownership that are far from market places.

We assessed differences in the attitudes of participating artisanal fishers toward this form of management to understand their importance in the design and implementation of fisheries management. We used questionnaires and participatory rural appraisal techniques to survey members of six fishing management committees. Fishers' attitudes varied significantly among syndicates in three main domains: attitudes toward the environment, unresolved aspects behind the management area policy, and perceived benefits derived from adoption of the policy. These differences indicated the existence of distinct world views that structure fishers' behavior toward the marine environment and its management. In addition, the responses made by fishers correlated best with the degree of off-sector pluriactivity and their dependence on diving as a source of income. This suggested that a livelihood approach to the development of Chilean artisanal fisheries that considers the multiple economic niches of the fishers will be most effective in the implementation of dual conservation/management measures.","journal":"Conservation Biology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Here we consider the impacts of superimposing co-management policy, in the form of territorial user rights for fishers over an existing traditional community-based natural-resource management system in Chile. We consider a broad definition of co-management that includes a spectrum of arrangements between governments and user groups described by different levels of devolution of power. We used participatory rural appraisal techniques and questionnaires to understand the mechanisms that underpin the traditional management system for the bull-kelp \"cochayuyo\" (Durvillaea antarctica). Traditional management was based on the allocation of informal access rights through a lottery system. This system was controlled by a complex web of traditional institutions that were shown to be successful in terms of equity and resilience. Using a similar approach, we analyzed the effects of superimposing a government-led co-management policy into this traditional system. Two major effects of the new policy were encountered. First, traditional institutions were weakened, which had negative effects on the levels of trust within the community and intensified conflict among users. Second, the management system's adaptive capacity was reduced, thereby jeopardizing the ecosystem's resilience. Our results suggest that the devolution of power to this kind of fisher community still has not reached the level required for fishers to legally address the local deficiencies of the Chilean co-management policy. Additionally, legal adjustments must be made to accommodate traditionally managed ecosystems that offer benefits comparable to those mandated under the formal policy. A fuller understanding of the interactions between co-management and traditional institutions can help us to identify ways to promote resilience and facilitate equal access by mitigating the potential negative effects of co-management policy and informing its future implementation.

Nevertheless, there are other instruments such as marine coastal co-management policy frameworks which may be also considered as tools for conservation or as ancillary conservation instruments. Using focus groups, semi-structured interviews and survey questionnaires we analysed small-scale artisanal fishers' perceptions towards a coastal co-management regime in Chile and the potential to generate capacities and a social setting to scale-up marine conservation. Empirical evidence from the study shows artisanal fishers have indeed been empowered through the coastal co-management experience; however, there exist heterogeneity in their willingness to participate in the creation of Nt-MPAs, mainly determined by occupational mobility. Chilean artisanal fishers strongly support a bottom-up process in the conservation of marine biodiversity, though the need for top-down steering and guidance is also stressed, especially regarding enforcement.

While co-management policy can enhance the management of fisheries, to date there have been few reports concerning how engagement in co-management regimes may affect fishers' perceptions. This paper assesses the determinants of fishers' environmental perceptions within a co-management regime in Chile. Group meetings and structured questionnaires showed fishers' environmental perceptions were composed of four domains of concern, termed water pollution, stock conservation, conservation/profit trade-offs and charismatic species. Fishers' dependence on diving and/or the length of time fishers had engaged with the policy affected their perceptions of each of these domains. Perceptions of the water pollution domain were related to length of time fishers had participated in co-management, probably because fishers gained an increased understanding of the market and its need for unpolluted produce. Attitudes towards conservation/profit trade-offs tended to become linked to an increasingly conservation-oriented ethic with increasing time of engagement with the policy. Given that the length of time fishers engaged with co-management differentially affected fishers' perceptions of environmental domains of concern, public officials and funding agencies should be careful not to judge co-management prematurely. It takes time to educate participants and overcome distrust. Through co-management processes in Chile, fishers' environmental awareness increased, and sustainable behaviours may consequently increase in the future.

Management is based on an agreed set of harvesting practices that serve as rules to be followed by the harvesters and which are intended to maximise regeneration of cut areas. A key element of the apparent success of management has been the agreement of sole access rights granted to the charcoal producers group and their sustainable prescriptive harvesting and surveillance functions supported by the management strategy endorsed by the relevant agencies, within a policy context set by the St. Lucian government that has favoured protection and permitted the delegation of management authority.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Semi-structured interviews were undertaken at nine MPAs to investigate MPA managers' (n = 9) and higher governmental level authorities' (n = 5) perceptions on these. Varying levels of MPA governance approaches were assessed, from government-led centralized top-down (e.g. marine biological reserves) to community-based bottom-up MPA categories (e.g. marine extractive reserves). The use of fishers' LEK was found to be an essential means of achieving a broader and more diverse knowledge basis for MPA management, though most of the management current in place is still science-driven in Brazil. The full engagement of local knowledge can also be regarded as a means of empowering local communities and promoting responsibility, but only if a more inclusive praxis of participation is put to work. Different meanings for 'Local Knowledge Use' in MPA management were outlined and described for different management approaches (top-down vs. bottom-up). It was noted that each of these meanings brings different outcomes in terms of stakeholder participation and empowerment. It is also suggested that MPA co-management schemes might benefit from the adoption of a 'knowledge-building' instead of 'knowledge-using' approach during a 'problem-solving' instead of 'decision-making' management process. Finally, it is concluded that it will be an enormous challenge to put LEK to work in the benefit of MPAs in the country amidst so many priority actions brought by the problems affecting the Brazilian National System of MPAs. Government must open up the agenda to deliberatively discuss the roles of local knowledge in MPA management, whilst local communities organise themselves and increase the demand for participation with responsibility.

MPA managers and higher governmental level authorities were interviewed about their perceptions of the implementation of a national MPA strategy and the recent changes in the institutional arrangement of government marine conservation agencies. Interviewees' narratives were generally pessimistic and the National System was perceived as weak, with few recognizable marine conservation outcomes on the ground. The following major flaws were identified: poor inter-institutional coordination of coastal and ocean governance; institutional crisis faced by the national government marine conservation agency; poor management within individual MPAs; problems with regional networks of marine protected areas; an overly bureaucratic management and administrative system; financial shortages creating structural problems and a disconnect between MPA policy and its delivery. Furthermore, a lack of professional motivation and a pessimistic atmosphere was encountered during many interviews, a malaise which we believe affects how the entire system is able to respond to crises. Our findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the role of 'leadership' in the performance of socio-ecological systems (such as MPA networks), more effective official evaluation mechanisms, more localized audits of (and reforms if necessary to) Brazil's federal biodiversity conservation agency (ICMBio), and the need for political measures to promote state leadership and support. Continuing to focus on the designation of more MPAs whilst not fully addressing these issues will achieve little beyond fulfilling, on paper, Brazil's international marine biodiversity commitments.

The species tested were the overexploited Afzelia quanzensis, important for timber and carvings of sculptures and utensils; Sclerocarya birrea, the marula tree used for wood, bark, and fruit; and Brachystegia glaucescens, the dominant miombo tree species, used for firewood, fiber, and fodder. Participants volunteered to plant and manage the test seeds, while a research team monitored their activities and results for 26 months. For Afzelia quanzensis, the germination rate was 81%, and 69% of the seedlings were still alive after one year. In the case of Sclerocarya birrea, the germination rate was 69%, and the one-year survival rate was 50%. For Brachystegia glaucescens, the germination rate was only 30%, and the survival rate was 31%. The main reasons for planting were to provide shade, to serve as a windbreak, and to conserve and gain individual control over dwindling natural resources, particularly Afzelia quanzensis. Women were generally more active and innovative than men. For instance, they searched for their own seeds or seedlings in the bush when there weren't sufficient plants. Some participants tried out various indigenous methods of pest and disease control, water conservation, and moisture retention. Group feedback sessions and informal interactions provided the opportunity to share experiences. The participants learned that indigenous trees can be purposefully planted and were not simply a gift from God. Despite the droughts and political instability of recent years, a growing number of people became involved in tree planting during 2002-2003.

Environmental service rewards (ESR) present an opportunity for incentives-based conservation, enabling livelihood and conservation goals to be more easily reconciled.

This article analyzes ethnobotanical data from three sites in the eastern African highlands to analyze the likely consequences of applying diverse regulatory and incentive (ESR) schemes. Data illustrate that when applied in isolation, carbon rewards can undermine water conservation and local livelihood objectives alike through expansion of fast-growing tree species at the expense of water supply and other land uses.

It is a part of the largest mangrove forest in the world, with an area of about 10,000 km2, of which 6,000 km2 are in Bangladesh and about 4,000 km2 are part of India: it has been recognized as an internationally important World Heritage and Ramsar site. The mangroves provide substantial ecosystem services supporting the livelihood of local communities. This paper describes the diverse uses of these natural resources and aims to evaluate the contribution of ecosystem services to the livelihood of residents. The results indicate that residents depend on ecosystem services in two ways. First, local households earn cash income by selling ecosystem products, such as fi sh, honey, and nipa palm, at local markets. Second, the use of natural resources provides substantial subsistence such as food, fresh water, and timber. However, residents' income may be signifi cantly increased by improved resource management, including reducing local authority corruption and improvements in law enforcement.

In the course of the reserve's spatial development and the potential integration of populated areas, participatory management arises as a crucial challenge. A first study of local stakeholders (private and state forestry enterprises, local communities), their attitudes and potential conflicts as well as synergies was conducted in 2008. Local communities, especially authorities, generally have a fairly positive attitude towards sustainable development and cooperation. Conflicts exist mainly between the CBR and the forestry sector, which is presently least oriented towards sustainability and rather focussed on economic revenue. We identified a common, but not insurmountable, lack of communication and cooperation between stakeholders. Local acceptance of the CBR is growing. Therefore the CBR can take the lead in applying a more integrative and participatory conservation management approach.","journal":"Eco.mont","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This study aimed to understand the relationship between market proximity, NTFP dependence and forest condition, and assess how it is mediated by local forest institutions. Three villages with different degrees of access to markets for sale of forest products, in an area of high poverty and forest dependence in the dry tropical forest belt in central India, were examined. The village with the greatest access to the market had a greater proportion of income coming from non-forest sources, the least dependence on NTFP harvest and the most degraded forests. The strongest forest institution was found in the village closest to the market, owing largely to its access to support from the Forest Department. This emphasizes the extreme vulnerability of forest villages located distant from local markets, which are forced to depend on forests for most of their livelihood and income requirements, and left to deal with degrading forests in the absence of technical and financial support from the Forest Department. There is a critical need to strengthen local institutions for sustainable forest management in such villages, and to provide them with alternate sources of income generation.

Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) play an important role in rural livelihoods. People living in and around forests are dependent on a variety of NTFPs for their subsistence and for income generation. This paper gives a general overview on the diversity of NTFPs in the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve, with a focus on medicinal and food plants. Data on NTFPs use were gathered through an ethnobotanical inventory with semistructured, free-listing, and household socioeconomic interviews. Interviews were supplemented with voucher collections. Bamboo shoots were analyzed further as proxy NTPF. It was hypothesized that there is no significant difference between collection amounts of bamboo shoots and their contribution to the household income between the villages studied. A rapid vulnerability assessment (RVA) was conducted to identify vulnerable and threatened species. A total of 480 plant species (25% of recorded flora) from 117 families and 334 genera are used as NTFPs by the local people. Results revealed that there is a significant difference in the collection and contribution of bamboo shoots to household income among the villages. However, their contribution to per-capita income is very low, and they are mainly used in households. Vulnerability assessment showed that most of the medicinal species have moderate vulnerable status and that most of the food species have less vulnerable status. Some medicinal plants, such as Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis, are overexploited and getting scarce. Sustainable harvest and management strategies should be implemented to prevent overexploitation of these species.

Spatial and temporal salinity gradients, because of freshwater river inflow and seasonal seawater influx, have created unique characteristics of an estuarine ecosystem, and exercised a continuous, selective influence on the biota. Unfortunately, its biodiversity and the livelihoods that depend on it were being lost at a fast rate because of a blockage of the lagoon's mouth by silt coming from upstream catchments, as well as oceanic long-shore transport. Projects to restore the dynamic characteristics of the lagoon included dredging a new mouth to the ocean, as well as prevention of soil erosion in upstream areas. Management efforts resulted in a dramatic revival of this ecosystem, and contributed to a sharp rise in the incomes of fisherfolk. The institutional aspects of implementing such large-scale policy changes also are discussed, and the remaining issues and lessons learned are presented.

M.","year":2000,"title":"Community participation in the protection of Kenya's wetlands","dAbstract":"In Africa today, many natural ecosystems are threatened with destruction, primarily because of unsustainable exploitation and negative impacts of development activities. Wetlands are prime targets of exploitation because they contain the basic resources, such as water, land, plants and animals, which are commonly used to fuel economic development. In Kenya wetlands support rural economy and up to seven million people depend on them for their livelihood. In addition there is considerable inter-institutional competition for wetland resources, particularly water. While a wetland policy is being developed by the government, widespread damage to wetland ecosystems continues at village level. Community participation in the protection of their own environment and in the conservation of wetland resources has therefore become a crucial strategy for stemming the loss of biological diversity and minimizing damage to the environment. This paper describes wetland conservation initiatives of several community groups in Kenya during the period 1990 to 1996. The paper outlines some of the projects which the community groups have been undertaking in order to generate income, create job opportunities for the youth and to protect their own environment. The wetland conservation activities and the author's experience while working with these community groups can serve as a suitable model for application in many African countries south of the Sahara.","journal":"Ostrich","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Moving beyond rhetoric: the need for participatory forest management with the Jakun of South-East Pahang, Malaysia. Centralized forest management is widely regarded as the catalyst for large-scale forest degradation and the loss of access, use and management rights of forest dependent communities. Forest dependent communities are often regarded as impediments to conservation and left out in sustainable forest management initiatives. This paper is a critique of the effects of centralization and alternative livelihood projects under the guise of conservation in a Jakun community of South-East Pahang, Malaysia. This case study revealed that economic pragmatism takes precedence over conservation in light of decreased autonomy over their traditional resources and rapid socio-economic changes which not only severely impedes their means to secure basic needs, but also their ability and desire to utilize forest resources in a sustainable manner. Therefore, there is an increasing need for local peoples to be involved in the management of their resources to maintain ecological integrity and to meet their subsistence needs. The findings justify the need for forest management units in South-East Pahang to develop a framework that addresses the rights of the Jakun to access, use and manage natural resources, which is a vital precondition for social justice to seek a common ground for sustainable forest management.","journal":"Journal of Tropical Forest Science","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Environmental education and awareness is important at all levels and needs to start early in order to make all impact on the Consciousness of the individual. In drylands especially, educational programmes which define a pedagogical method to raise environmental awareness among pupils and to help them learn about sustainable development is one of the major instruments to empower these pupils and the population to combat desertification and support biodiversity and environmental conservation. UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme is currently developing two teaching resource kits for environmental education, one of which has been designed to be used in dryland countries. The kits are intended for primary and secondary schoolteachers worldwide and are based on an innovative approach appealing to the creativity and artistic sensibilities of pupils. As educational material, the kits use a creative approach to awaken environmental knowledge through creative and thought-stimulating activities that encourage rediscovery and appreciation of the natural environment and biodiversity. Another important dimension of this approach is to bring in the very notion of sustainable development through the application of creative activities: in real-life situations and through specific exercices like creating illustrative inventories, role playing, scenario building, achieving frescoes, gardening, pupils learn to think of people as playing an integral part of the ecosystem and develop their capacity to think critically about the impact of human activities on the environment. As such, the kits are consistent with the activities developed as part of the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014) of which UNESCO is lead agency and feed in with the vision of education developed by the Education Sector Paper as it specifies that \"pursuing sustainable development through education requires educators and learners to reflect critically on their own communities; identify non-viable elements in their lives; and explore tensions among conflicting values and goals.

This paper presents data from a case study of human-wildlife interactions in villages along the northern boundary of the Selous Game Reserve in south-east Tanzania. Since 1989, this area has been the site of a project working to promote community wildlife management (CWM). Questionnaire survey data were used to examine villagers' conservation attitudes towards wildlife, the Game Reserve, and the activities of the CWM project and state wildlife management authority. Despite local support for the conservation of wildlife, many respondents were either unaware or held negative views of the activities of the wildlife management institutions. Logistic regression analyses show that while access to game meat from the CWM project has had a positive influence on perceptions of wildlife benefits and awareness of the project's activities, it has had no significant effect on local perceptions of the Game Reserve and the activities of the state wildlife management authority. The factors underlying the observed pattern of conservation attitudes were identified as the inequitable distribution of benefits from the CWM project, and the limited nature of community participation in wildlife management. The importance of institutional issues for the future progress of participatory approaches to conservation with development is emphasized.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Data from an attitudinal questionnaire survey of 202 households in four villages are used to examine local perceptions of wildlife crop-damage in terms of relative impact and which wildlife species were responsible. We explore the influence of wildlife crop-damage on attitudes to the adjacent game reserve. Data on the frequency of crop-damage events and estimated severity of impacts, recorded during a 6-month programme of crop-damage monitoring in one of the survey villages, are used to describe on-farm patterns of crop-damage. Comparison of the two data sets indicates a disjunction between the nature of the wildlife crop-damage conflict as perceived by local villagers, and as it actually occurs in the study area. This disjunction is discussed in relation to the effect of extreme damage events on local people's views, the opportunity costs involved in guarding farm plots against crop-damage, and the tenure arrangements for wildlife that define the relationship with the state wildlife management authority.

R.","year":2005,"title":"Principles and approaches to abate seabird by-catch in longline fisheries","dAbstract":"Mortality in longline fisheries is a critical global threat to most albatross and large petrel species. Here we identify key principles and approaches to identify and achieve broad use of effective seabird by-catch avoidance methods. Despite the availability of highly effective and cost-saving seabird avoidance methods, few longline fleets employ them. Given the political context and capacity of management authorities of the majority of longline fisheries, it is critical to identify seabird avoidance strategies that are not only highly effective, but are also economically viable and commercially practical. Adoption of an international performance standard for longline baited hook-sink rate, and prescribing minimum gear weighting designs that meet this standard that are achievable by all longline fisheries, would be an important step forward towards resolving low use of seabird avoidance methods by vessels, including those in illegal, unregulated and unreported fisheries. Due to differences between fleets, no single seabird avoidance measure is likely to be effective and practical in all longline fisheries. Therefore, testing of seabird avoidance methods in individual fleets is needed to determine efficacy and economic viability. Longline fishers should directly participate in these trials as they have a large repository of knowledge and skills to effectively develop and improve seabird by-catch avoidance techniques, and this provides industry with a sense of ownership for uptake of effective by-catch reduction methods. Establishing protected areas containing seabird colonies and adjacent waters within a nation's EEZ can be an expedient method to address seabird by-catch. However, establishing high seas marine protected areas to restrict longline fishing in seabird foraging areas, which would require extensive and dynamic boundaries and large buffer zones, may not be a viable short-term solution because of the extensive time anticipated to resolve legal complications with international treaties, to achieve international consensus and political will, and to acquire requisite extensive resources for surveillance and enforcement. Analysis of results of research on seabird avoidance methods reveals that the most reliable comparisons of the efficacy of alternative strategies are from comparing the effectiveness of methods tested in a single experiment. Benefits from standardizing the reporting of seabird by-catch rates to account for seabird abundance are described. To provide the most precise inputs for seabird population models, estimates of seabird mortality in longline fisheries should account for seabird falloff from hooks before hauling, delayed mortality of seabirds caught but freed from gear, and mortality caused by hooks discarded in offal.

Coastal development and ecosystems in the Pacific Islands region are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. We investigated the capacity of Pacific Island countries and territories to assess mangrove vulnerability to the effects of climate change, and their capacity to adapt to mangrove responses to these forces. Technical and institutional capacity-building priorities include: (1) strengthening management frameworks to conduct site-specific assessment of mangrove vulnerability and incorporate resulting information into land-use plans to prepare for any landward mangrove migration and offsetting anticipated losses; (2) reducing and eliminating stresses on and rehabilitating mangroves, in part, to increase mangrove resilience to climate change effects; and (3) augmenting abilities to establish mangrove baselines, and monitor gradual changes using standardized techniques through a regional network to distinguish local and climate change effects on mangroves. Other priorities are to: (4) assess how mangrove margins have changed over recent decades; (5) determine projections of trends in mean relative sea level and trends in the frequency and elevation of extreme high water events; (6) measure trends in changes in elevations of mangrove surfaces; and (7) incorporate this information into land-use planning processes. Also in (8) some locations require spatial imagery showing topography and locations of mangroves and coastal development. Land-use planners can use information from assessments predicting shoreline responses to projected sea level rise and other climate change effects to reduce risks to coastal development, human safety, and coastal ecosystems. This advanced planning enables coastal managers to minimize social disruption and cost, minimize losses of valued coastal ecosystems, and maximize available options.

In so doing, we demonstrate the benefit of using such models to explore 'in principle' questions pertaining to biodiversity policy. The results show that the effectiveness of government policies in protecting target vulnerable species can depend on a number of other factors influencing agricultural land-use decision-making, such as input costs, market variability and farmer aspiration levels.

{"author":"Gladstone, W.","year":2009,"title":"Conservation and Management of Tropical Coastal Ecosystems","dAbstract":"All major coastal ecosystems in the tropics are being degraded. The problems include losses of biodiversity, reduced ecosystem functions, and costs to coastal human societies. Declines in species' abundances, and habitat loss and modification are the result of the demands for aquaculture, port construction, trawling, excessive nutrient loads, overfishing and collecting, sedimentation from catchment activities, invasive species, and climate change. A global response to these changes has been conservation and management approaches that aim to reduce, reverse, and prevent unnatural changes and address their underlying causes. Successes in conservation and management are likely when actions are designed to achieve the fundamental ecological goals of ensuring resilience, maintaining ecosystem connectivity, protecting water quality, conserving species-at-risk, conserving representative samples of species and assemblages, and managing at the appropriate spatial scale. Achieving societal aspirations for coastal ecosystems requires that management approaches address the socio-economic aspects of issues and include stakeholder consultation, participation, and education. Achieving long-term success in conservation and management requires coastal nations to address fundamental issues such as lack of information for management decision-making, population growth and poverty, limited technical and management capacity, poor governance, lack of stakeholder participation, the mismatches between the issue and the geographic scale of management, lack of an ecosystem perspective, ineffective governance and management, and a lack of awareness of the effects of human activities.","journal":"","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This paper examines how the criminalization of mangrove tree use affects ecosystem management outcomes. We explore the biological, economic and social sustainability effects of the legal ban on mangrove use on the coast of Braganc, a, Para, north Brazil. There are two main categories of mangrove users in this area: firstly, local subsistence users who also derive some financial incomes from mangrove sale. Their mangrove use is intertwined with household livelihood strategies and they display self-initiated planning and action towards sustainable management; secondly, more \"mobile\", purely commercial users who are responsible for most commercial mangrove exploitation and who employ regionally sequential, predatory resource exploitation strategies. These users are typically based at some distance from the exploited areas and share neither local livelihood strategies nor sustainability agendas. The current outright ban on any utilization of mangrove flora seems to undermine biological sustainability, is economically inefficient and generates normative insecurity, conflict and social polarization. The ineffectiveness of the outright legal prohibition of mangrove tree use in terms of sustainable coastal management leads us to investigate alternative management options. We suggest that the legalization of local mangrove utilization and the strengthening of local users' rights and responsibilities to control outsiders in a co-management framework, as proposed in the Brazilian extractive reserves (RESEX) approach, is most likely to advance ecologically, economically and socially sustainable mangrove management. It is demonstrated that a legal recognition of local entitlements to mangrove trees would reduce social vulnerability and therefore move forest management outcomes into more desirable directions.","journal":"Regional Environmental Change","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Despite a well-designed institutional structure to facilitate local participation, local knowledge about the CB-MPA is found to be low and resource access and influence on decision-making in the programme is negligible for the majority of islanders. At the same time, most of those who know about the programme consider it as pertaining to the public authority only. These findings stand in contrast to evidence on non-formal ways of protecting and managing marine areas in the same geographical area but outside the formal MPA institutional framework. In particular, the article identifies a number of emergent rules-in-use in marine management, which operate parallel to legally established MPAs. It is argued that emergent forms of marine area protection such as non-formal self-organising island exclusion zones (IEZ) offer as yet mostly unused potentials for formal MPA development, particularly in those coastal and marine areas without traditional forms of marine and coastal management.

However, eradication is more feasible on islands than on continents. We present a global analysis of 1,224 successful eradications of invasive plants and animals on 808 islands. Most involve single vertebrate species on uninhabited islands, but plant and invertebrate eradications occur more often on inhabited islands. Inhabited islands are often highly modified and support numerous introduced species. Consequently, targeting a single invasive species can be ineffective or counterproductive. The impacts of other pests will continue and, in some cases, be exacerbated. The presence of people also creates regulatory, logistical and socio-political constraints. Real or perceived health risks to inhabitants, pets and livestock may restrict the use of some eradication tools, and communities or individuals sometimes oppose eradication. Despite such challenges, managing invasive species is vital to conserve and restore the unique biodiversity of many inhabited islands, and to maintain or improve the welfare and livelihoods of island residents. We present a brief case study of the Juan FernÃ¡ndez Archipelago, Chile, and discuss the feasibility of eradicating large suites of invasive plants and animals from inhabited islands while managing other invaders for which eradication is not feasible or desirable. Eradications must be planned to account for species interactions. Monitoring and contingency plans must detect and address any 'surprise effects'. Above all, it is important that the local community derives social, cultural and/or economic benefits, and that people support and are engaged in the restoration effort.

As one of the solutions, Participatory Forest Management (PFM) scheme was introduced during the early 1990s by some NGOs. Nearly two decades of experience now exists in the country. However systematic assessments of the performance of the scheme are scanty. This study reports the experience from Bonga PFM project, which is one of the oldest pilot sites. Forest inventory and socio-economic survey were conducted to collect data. The study was conducted during a transition from NGO-Community to State-Community based management of the PFM project. PFM is shown to have positive impacts both on the state of the forest and living condition of participant households at least within the project life time. Forest conditions such as seedling and sapling densities improved. PFM also (i) promoted awareness about forest, (ii) capacitated locals to form new institutional arrangement that increased their participation in forest management, helped to reduce open access and assisted a regulated forest use, and (iii) contributed towards social equity in terms of gender and minority ethnic groups. When accompanied with complementary non-forest based livelihood activities, PFM helped to diversify income sources, increase household income level, and build household assets. This reduced dependence of communities on forests for livelihoods. A challenge threatening the sustainability of the PFM program in Ethiopia is the weak government support for the scheme. PFM is still far from being mainstreamed in the forest management system of the country. Thus, it will be appropriate to assess how the PFM programs would perform few years after the support of the NGOs terminates.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This paper evaluates one such project in Peru's Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, which entailed community-based natural resource-management plans for palm and aquatic resources. We conducted semistructured interviews with reserve inhabitants (n=57) during May 2007, as well as key-informant interviews with state and non-governmental organization (NGO) staff. Monitoring data and reports from NGOs were important secondary sources in this study. The intervention has improved the status of targeted species and has improved the well-being of participants. This project worked well for a number of reasons, including the long-term commitment of the implementing organization, the social capital and legitimacy provided by participation in management groups, and the fact that local knowledge was incorporated into resource-management techniques.

Ethnocultural community members are both sponsors and beneficiaries of biobanks. In addition, the success of biobank projects depends on community support and participation. Yet there are few empirical data on views, perceptions and interests of ethnocultural communities on biobanks. This silent gap in genomics, ethics and policy literatures has to be addressed. We conducted a qualitative research study with in-depth interviews of ethnocultural community leaders (e.g., members of the Canadian Parliament, school commissioners) on their perspectives concerning population specific genomics research and biobanks. An equal partnership model where public is not only informed, but also involved in decision-making processes was perceived as an essential democratic requisite. These empirical data on ethnocultural community leaders' views, interests and perceptions identify several key socio-cultural and ethical factors that can be decisive for effective and sustainable community involvement in biobanks.

Understanding these forces is of paramount importance to improve the well-being of native Amazonians and to foster the conservation of biological diversity, yet most analyses of these forces rely on cross-sectional data. Though adequate to describe the association between variables at one point in time, cross-sectional data do not allow one to estimate changes in well-being over time. We collected data annually during five consecutive years (2002-2006, inclusive) from a foraging and farming society of native Amazonians in Bolivia (Tsimane') to estimate annual rates of change for seven indicators of adult well-being. Indicators encompassed both objective and subjective measures of well-being that included economic, health, psychological, and social dimensions that overlap well with Tsimane' notions of well-being. The annual rate of change in the inflation-adjusted ( hereafter real) value of food consumption (+6.35%), body mass index (+0.71%), and incidence of anger (-10.40%) show significant improvements over time, but the annual rate of change in the self-reported number of recent ailments (+7.35%) shows a significant deterioration. Trends in other indicators of well-being (smiles, real wealth, social relations) show positive but insignificant rates of change. Results did not vary by sex and were consistent when using other indicators of well-being.","journal":"Current Anthropology","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

In 1966-1991, by-caught cetaceans were legally used for domestic animal consumption. In early 1990s, human consumption of cetacean meat and market trade was observed. After 1994, the conservation status of all cetacean species was improved in Ukraine by the Red Data Book, and food consumption of by-caught animals was prohibited. However, the facts of economical use of by-caught and stranded cetaceans by coastal residents and tourists are still reported; nevertheless, this problem have not been studied in the region. As a rule, the particular facts remain unknown to scientists or authorities. Thereby, student audience was applied for anonymous reports on consumption of cetaceans including not only personal experience of the respondents, but also the evidences of their parents, neighbours and friends. This approach was found to be very effective and brought very interesting results. Here the results of questionnaire survey in 2002-2011 (about 3000 students and local people), anonymous reports by coastal residents, and materials of field excursions, from the coastline from Odessa to Sochi for the period from 1976 to 2010 were analyzed. The questionnaire contained confidential questions about economical use of animal carcasses by coastal residents (human consumption, domestic animal feeding, cases of incidental and direct catches, etc.), and about attitude of respondents to the Red Data Book, problems of cetacean conservation and their sources of information in this sphere. The most of respondents know about the Red Data Book (mainly from educational courses and TV), and support cetacean conservation. In total, about 200 cases of food consumption and technical use of by-caught and stranded animals were reported. Geographical area of economical using occupies mainly the regions of traditional coastal fisheries, non-urban and underdeveloped territories of the Crimea. The most cases, in which the species was identified, concern harbour porpoise and bottlenose dolphin. Several ways of economic use are reported: human consumption by local residents (mainly fishermen, marginal and underclass population, teenagers and tourists) in all coastal regions; in addition, eleven cases of cafe/restaurant service in cities were reported; animal feeding in poultry and hog households, as well as fur-bearing animals, dog and cat feeding is routine; porpoise blubber use for medicine and cooking as a local tradition (mainly Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait). Findings of disarticulated animals were recorded in all coastal regions. At least, five cases of direct take/killing were reported marking a dangerous tendency in human-cetacean interactions. Economical use of by-caught and stranded cetaceans occurs sporadically in the northern Black Sea coastal zone despite legislative and conservation measures.","journal":"","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This extensive expansion needs to involve an assessment of the potential impacts on the people who rely on forest resources for subsistence. Wildlife for human consumption (bushmeat) is one such resource that has received great attention on mainland Africa but has largely been ignored in Madagascar until recently. In terms of biomass, hunting in Madagascar appears to be on a lesser scale compared to areas of mainland Africa. However, because of the life-history characteristics associated with hunted primate and carnivore species in Madagascar even small-scale hunting is a major threat to long-term conservation. In this study I used semi-structured interviews to quantify annual rates of bushmeat harvest in 14 villages adjacent to the Makira Forest in north-eastern Madagascar. Interviews revealed that 23 mammal species were hunted for consumption, providing a new insight into the scale and frequency of bushmeat use. Harvest data and life-history information were sufficient to allow quantitative assessments of sustainability for four species of lemur (black and white ruffed lemur Varecia variegata, indri Indri indri, eastern bamboo lemur Hapalemur griseus and white-fronted brown lemur Eulemur albifrons) and a species of the carnivore family Eupleridae (fossa Cryptoprocta ferox). Model results suggest hunting of these species is probably unsustainable. This research presents clear evidence that hunting is a major conservation and livelihoods issue in Madagascar and needs to be considered in the planning stages of protected area development to address better the needs of local people.

This study addressed such a programmethe Green Council Programme (GCP)developed and implemented in schools by the Israeli Society for Protection of Nature. A pre-test/post-test design was used to investigate the influence of participation in the GCP on components of junior high-school students' environmental literacy. Conceptualizations of environment', environmental attitudes and sense of ability to act on environmental issues were studied employing quantitative and qualitative tools. Contribution of the programme to the cognitive domain, in developing a systemic understanding of the environment, was limited. On the other hand, participating in this programme heightened students' sensitivity to humanenvironment interrelationships and developed a more ecological worldview. After the programme, students demonstrated greater perception of humans as part of the environment, an increased sensitivity to human impact on the environment and their value for non-human nature moved from an anthropocentric to a more ecocentric orientation. While students' internal locus-of-control increased, when environmental protection entailed personal economic trade-offs, their support was limited and remained unchanged. The article concludes with recommendations, based on the findings, regarding supplementing the school (science) curriculum with external EE enrichment programmes.","journal":"International Journal of Science Education","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

PES projects are often defined as voluntary transactions where well-defined environmental/ecosystem services (or land uses likely to secure those services) are bought by a minimum of one service buyer, from a minimum of one service provider, if and only if the service provider continuously secures service provision (conditionality). Further criteria of PES include limiting additional objectives and ensuring that payments reward behaviour that would otherwise not occur (additionality). Together these best practices for PES are increasingly accepted as the most efficient means to achieve desired outcomes and are guiding funding for PES projects. We used a series of water funds (watershed-oriented PES projects based on a trust fund model) to examine how theoretical best practices could inform and improve practice and also how theory could learn from practical efforts. We conclude that thoughtful consideration is required when evaluating the promise of a PES approach against a theoretical ideal. We found that requiring conditionality may limit the use of creative finance mechanisms such as trust funds that can provide long-term benefits for conservation and human well-being, and that requiring additionality can exclude benefits from social diffusion and result in the inefficient targeting of PES funds. Finally, public-private partnerships in water funds lead to multiple additional/side objectives but partnerships are likely to lower transaction costs and provide transparent, long-term landscape-scale watershed management.

An Analysis of CITES' Conservation Policies","dAbstract":"The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has been criticised for following a narrow preservationist agenda centred on protecting charismatic species through trade-restrictive policies that disregard the livelihood strategies of communities living alongside wildlife. More recently, however, parties to CITES have embraced the sustainability discourse and taken steps to address the socio-economic dimensions of wildlife trade. This paper examines the policies developed by CITES' Parties at four recent meetings, with a view to determining whether they are founded on a holistic understanding of socio-environmental dynamics. It concludes that CITES' conservation approach remains rooted in a conception of sustainability that treats people and wildlife as separate entities, and where species conservation takes priority over human development. Nonetheless, CITES does appear to be moving towards a more all-encompassing perception of sustainability where focus is on ecosystems rather than ensuring the survival of single species.

Restocking activities were done in collaboration with local groups by providing training in the culture and ocean rearing of giant clams, and by implementing a \"users pay\" approach. Initially, a variety of giant clam species was used but once F1 broodstock of Tridacna gigas were reared, restocking focused on this species due to its scarcity and fast rate of growth. About 20 000 T. gigas were placed on coral reefs. In addition, >50 000 clams (T. gigas, T. squamosa, T. derasa, T. crocea, T. maxima and Hippopus hippopus) were distributed through other means. Altogether, >40 sites throughout the Philippines received cultured giant clams. Grow-out trials to test the viability of supplying giant clams for the aquarium trade to create new sources of income were conducted successfully with a group of fishers in Bolinao, Pangasinan. However, this initiative encountered legal obstacles when the government regulatory agency prohibited the export of cultured clams, regarding this as a threat to the conservation of wild individuals. The long experience in culturing and restocking giant clams in the Philippines provides many lessons for other countries wishing to restore stocks of these large bivalves. Particular care needs to be given to selection of release sites, negotiations with participating groups to safeguard the released clams, adequate transfer of technology to collaborators, and transport of large clams from nursery areas to release sites.

The government considers rural poverty as the main cause of environment degradation, associated with slash-and-burn cultivation and to an unclear definition of property rights on forest land. In 1993, the government launched a Forest Land Allocation programme aiming to lease forest lands to individual households and, on this basis, to solve food security problems, halt the increasing environment degradation and preserve the remaining forests. To evaluate the results of this land reform policy, two upland pilot communes have been intensively monitored. The environmental and economic impacts of the forest land reform allocation in the two study areas are presented, after providing a background on the Vietnamese situation of mountain zones. On the basis of these findings, it is discussed as to whether the current forest land allocation process may actually promote local development and natural resources conservation, and under what conditions. Deforestation problems must be tackled also with new macroeconomic policies (e.g. credit programmes to support sustainable agriculture practices) and social policy (e.g. reduction of demographic pressure), together with the reform of the State institutions (e.g. State Forest Enterprises) involved in management of the forest areas.

Unlike other oceanic archipelagos, the ecological and evolutionary processes characteristic of Galapagos have been minimally affected by human activities, and the archipelago still retains most of its original, unique biodiversity. However, several recent reports suggest that the development model has turned unsustainable and that the unique values of the archipelago might be seriously at risk. In response to international concern, UNESCO added Galapagos to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 2007. Our goal was to provide new insights into the origins of the present-day crisis and suggest possible management alternatives. To this end, we re-examined the Galapagos situation from a broad systems perspective, conceptualizing the archipelago as a complex social-ecological system. Past, present, and possible future trends were explored using the resilience theory as a perspective for understanding the dynamics of the system. Four major historical periods were characterized and analyzed using Holling's adaptive cycle metaphor. The current Galapagos situation was characterized as a prolonged series of crisis events followed by renewal attempts that have not yet been completed. Three plausible future scenarios were identified, with tourism acting as the primary driver of change. The current tourism model reduces the system's resilience through its effects on the economy, population growth, resource consumption, invasive species arrival, and lifestyle of the island residents. Opportunities to reorganize and maintain a desirable state do exist. However, strong political and management decisions are urgently needed to avoid an irreversible shift to a socially and environmentally undesirable regime. Key measures to achieve a new sustainability paradigm for Galapagos include modifying traditional practices to produce a more adaptive resilience-based co-management model, adopting a more comprehensive approach to territorial planning, strengthening participative approaches and institutional networks, and promoting transdisciplinary research at the frontiers of social and biophysical sciences.","journal":"Ecology and Society","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

An overfishing crisis led to a closure of the loco fishery (1989-1992), and to the incorporation of territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFS) into fisheries legislation. Organizations of artisanal fishers are entitled to co-manage parcels of seabed with the state. We used old and new data on the loco fishery of Region IV (the cradle of the system) to investigate the performance of TURFs, which presently encompass 36% of the prime habitat that contributed close to 82% of historical yield. Abundance within TURFS and legal catch are stabilized, the fishery looks orderly, and perception of TURFS is generally positive. The system is dual, however, and at least half of the catch is illegal, originating from background areas outside the TURFS. Corrective action requires incentives that would eliminate the illegal catch, increase fishermen's participation, and provide simple feedback decision rules driven by data and more flexibility allowing fishermen to experiment and diversify activities. Attention is needed to biological processes at scales that transcend the boundaries of locally managed TURFS and to values and priorities other than biological sustainability that may be of societal significance.","journal":"Bulletin of Marine Science","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

In the tropics, wetlands are indeed the product of the interaction over centuries with rural populations who have managed them through experience. In recent decades, increasing population pressure and desire for rapid economic growth have led to overexploitation and consequent degradation of wetland habitats. Current emphasis on wetland management has two objectives: firstly to conserve biotic diversity and representative habitats for their natural functions, and secondly to maximize economic gains. Keoladeo Ghana National Park (at Bharatpur near Agra), well-known for its avifauna, and Lake Kolleru wetland (east coast of India) exemplify the two management objectives respectively. Recent management practices in both wetlands have resulted in new problems as important as those the management initially sought to solve. In Keoladeo, the management eliminated the direct impact of people on the wetland, whereas in Lake Kolleru, the age-old practices of local people are being replaced by intensive fish farming methods. The problems created by (mis) management owing to mistaken perceptions about the role of people in sustaining wetland values, are discussed briefly.

International efforts through REDD+, CDM and voluntary carbon markets aim to encourage complementary activities of forest preservation, reforestation, afforestation and sustainable forest management. Many existing programs for sustainable forest management, agriculture and development dovetail with payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs in their similar concerns regarding the allocation of rights and responsibilities, agreements on service provision, and the verification and quantification of benefits. Recent efforts to link biodiversity conservation with national scale REDD+ initiatives depend on the explicit regulatory linkage of biodiversity preservation goals with carbon targets. We emphasize the need to include biodiversity conservation and sustainable development as integral components of forest carbon projects. As fundamental social, political and cultural issues have yet to be addressed in the current market structure, we urge a better understanding of the tradeoffs between the full suite of ecosystem services provided by different forest types.

It documents the loss of mountain population over this period and analyses its implications on demography and land use. The combined processes of growth in the piedmont and outmigration from the mountains have led to a drop in the proportion of the mountain population within the Republic from 20% in 1900 to 1% in 2010. Most of the population loss in the mountains occurred before 1989 and was due to forced as well as opportunity-based migration. The key demographic effects of this exodus are a lack of young people and overrepresentation of old people in mountain communities, with an old-to-young-age dependency ratio of 1.42, which is very high in international comparison. Outmigration and social change led to the abandonment of the majority of mountain settlements and of traditional land management, posing a threat to cultural heritage. The current open-access grazing regime leads to overuse of easily accessible pastures and underuse of more remote grazing areas. Bush and forest encroachment are visible on remote pastures within the montane zone, and first stages of the process are also evident in subalpine meadows. Mountain development is at a crossroads today. The survival of the remaining communities seems uncertain in spite of an emerging interest in mountains and mountain recreation among the urban population. Official development plans focus on resort-based tourism and hydropower generation, thus serving mainly lowland interests. The methods used for this study include a literature review, use of official statistics from different administrative levels, and five field campaigns from 2006 to 2010 for ground truthing, local data collection and survey, and for conducting interviews and informal discussions with officials and administrators at different levels, and mountain residents.","journal":"Erdkunde","included":false,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":true}

These include increasing abundance of reef organisms both inside and outside NTAs, protecting key ecosystem functions, and providing social and economic benefits through improved fisheries and tourism. However, there is a lack of convincing evidence for many of these expectations. This is the first attempt to synthesize all potential costs and benefits of coral reef NTAs and critically examine evidence of their impacts on both ecosystems and societies. NTAs with high compliance consistently increase the diversity, density and biomass of exploited reef fishes and certain groups of motile invertebrates within their boundaries and have benefits for reef-associated tourism. Some NTAs provide small increases in the abundance of corals and decreases in macroalgal cover. The effects of NTAs on genetic diversity and connectivity among meta-populations are variable or as yet unquantified. There is limited evidence of NTAs providing social benefits through increased fishery yields and tourism revenue. There are examples of both positive and negative effects on social well-being. Finally, sharks, marine megafauna and microbial communities showed few tangible benefits from NTAs. Substantial gaps in the science of coral reef NTAs remain, especially in their capacity to provide socioeconomic benefits. A crucial research priority is understanding how the cumulative effects of climate change will influence the various benefits that NTAs provide. To be effective, NTAs must be used in conjunction with a range of other management tools and applied according to local environmental and societal contexts. Â© R. N. Gibson, R. J. A. Atkinson, J. D.

The scope of perceived crop damage in three communities and local attitudes toward elephants and protected areas were surveyed in the BÃ©nouÃ© Wildlife Conservation Area, Cameroon in 2010. Temporal changes in attitudes and perceived crop damage were estimated using previous work. The percent of households reporting elephant crop raiding increased since 1997 (58% vs. 40%). Attitudes toward BÃ©nouÃ© National Park were positive and did not change over time, although more people today were positive toward the hunting concessions. Crop damage by elephants did not significantly influence attitudes toward the species, yet 52% reported no benefit to elephant presence in the area. Immigration likely contributed to increased reported elephant damages, hence, land use planning and the prevention of further encroachment is central to reducing human-elephant conflict.

A.","year":2005,"title":"Co-management approach to marine conservation in MohÃ©li, Comoros Islands","dAbstract":"Many developing countries experience habitat degradation and unsustainable natural resource exploitation, with biodiversity and habitat conservation efforts often impeded by political instability and limited funding. Challenges in previous conservation efforts coupled with the current rate of marine habitat degradation and species declines warrant consideration of an innovative conservation approach. Co-management of protected areas addresses biological, cultural, economic, and political concerns and empowers communities through collaboration and integration in conservation efforts. It provides flexibility for adaptive practices to address underlying socioeconomic factors affecting conservation efforts and may compensate for limited or missing scientific data. The ecosystems of the Comoros Islands in the West Indian Ocean, a biodiversity hotspot with high endemism and diverse tropical marine habitats, are adversely affected by existing ecological, socioeconomic, and political conditions. MohÃ©li Marine Park was designed to address threats to the marine environment and is a model for co-management practices. We conducted a year-long evaluation of the park implementation process, including community and fisher participation. After 3 years of operation with 80% local community control, the park maintains a small staff to monitor sea turtle nesting beaches, reef health, fisheries, and uninhabited islets and to guide ecotourists and educate visitors. Our analysis revealed successes and shortcomings of the co-management approach. Successes included local communities empowered to participate in natural resource management, increased local involvement in conservation initiatives, and use of traditional knowledge when scientific information was unavailable. The Comoros example also illustrates that co-management is not immune to social issues, inadequate government law enforcement, or political instability and is an incomplete substitute for sound science. Lessons learned are applicable elsewhere and offer a template for effective scientific research and monitoring, policy making, and management of protected areas in developing nations.

In response to this flooding the Chinese government devised the National Forest Protection Plan, a key component of this plan is the Tuigeng huanlin (Sloping Land Conversion) policy. Under this scheme, farmers are offered grain subsidies and small cash payments in compensation for voluntarily returning marginal farmland to forest. This article looks at the initial demonstration stage of Tuigeng huanlin in the southwest and northwest of China and focuses on rural households: â€¢ their participation in the policy, â€¢ the choices made in terms of tree species (economic or ecological , and â€¢ the effect of participation on incomes and livelihoods. It also examines the stability of the policy and the impact these aspects will have on the potential of the Sloping Land Conversion Policy (SLCP) to attain its objectives of environmental protection and increased forest cover in China.

Local knowledge about wild plant gathering in the Biosphere Reserve Grosses Walsertal (Austria)","dAbstract":"Background: Wild plant gathering is an essential element in livelihood strategies all over the world. However due to changing circumstances in Europe, the reason for gathering has altered from one of necessity in the past to a pleasurable activity today. Wild plant gathering has therefore also received renewed attention as a form of intangible cultural heritage expressing local preferences, habits and man's relationship with nature.In the Biosphere Reserve Grosses Walsertal (Austria), local people's knowledge of the gathering of wild plants and their perception of their own gathering activities are being documented. The focus of this paper is on the uses of herbal teas and the informal guidelines for gathering plants that have been issued by the Bergtee (mountain tea) association.Methods: Thirty-six free-list interviews were conducted with subsequent semi-structured interviews and three focus group meetings held with members of the Bergtee association. Participatory observation (gathering and processing plants, mixing and marketing tea) also allowed for greater understanding of what had been reported.Results: In total, 140 different gathered plant species were listed by respondents. Herbal tea is the most frequently mentioned use. The Bergtee association, founded by a young man and two middle-aged women in the valley, is a good example of the link between biological and cultural diversity, with the aim of sharing the biosphere reserve's natural treasures as well as local plant-related knowledge in the form of herbal tea products. The association's informal guidelines for gathering reflect people's attitude to nature: monetary income does not play a major role in gathering plants; instead people's appreciation of the value of the nature around them is to the fore.Conclusions: Gathering wild plants can be seen as an expression of people's regional identity. The conscious appreciation of nature and related local knowledge is crucial for the sustainable conservation and use of the Biosphere Reserve's resources.

The interdependence between healthy ecosystems and community well-being lies at the heart of community-based ecosystem management. Core ideas focus on linking stewardship to the unique role that local communities and workers can play in its implementation; developing social and institutional processes that are more open, democratic and civil; monitoring ecosystem, social, and economic subsystems and modifying actions based on what is learned; empowering communities to strengthen their participation in natural resource management and address power imbalances; and developing a new understanding and valuation of the broad array of ecosystem products and services. The paper concludes with a discussion of ways community-based ecosystem management can be advanced, including: emphasizing the essential role of communities and workers in sustainable resource management; maintaining and building community capacity; improving understanding of worker issues and promoting an ecosystem workforce; establishing local and institutional processes that are inclusive, accessible and transparent; creating a civic science that respects and engages diverse people and knowledge systems; establishing new public and private approaches to long-term investment in ecosystem restoration and maintenance and in community-based stewardship; and advancing laws and policies that promote collaboration and coordination needed for long-term stewardship.","journal":"Journal of Sustainable Forestry","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Despite extensive theoretical discussions, little has been done to study attitudes toward and consequences of such advocacy in particular cases. We assessed attitudes toward science and policy advocacy in the case of marine protected areas (MPAs) on the basis of a survey of delegates at the First International Marine Protected Areas Congress. Delegates were all members of the international marine conservation community and represented academic, government, and nongovernmental organizations. A majority of respondents believed science is objective but only a minority believed that values can be eliminated from science. Respondents showed only partial support of positivist principles of science. Almost all respondents supported scientists being integrated into MPA policy making, whereas half of the respondents agreed that scientists should actively advocate for particular MPA policies. Scientists with a positivist view of science supported a minimal role for scientists in policy, whereas government staff with positivist beliefs supported an advocacy or decision-making role for scientists. Policy-making processes for MPAs need to account for these divergent attitudes toward science and advocacy if science-driven and participatory approaches are to be reconciled.

Approximately 37% of the State is classified as forest, including a well-planned network of protected areas (PAs) that comprises 2 national parks and 18 sanctuaries. Much of the remaining forest is under huge pressure from forest fires, livestock grazing, slash-and-burn agriculture, wildlife poaching, and illegal or unregulated collection of fuel wood, timber and other forest products. Major initiatives are underway in Orissa to conserve its natural forest biodiversity. The Orissa Forestry Sector Development Project (OFSDP), beginning in 2006, started to focus on providing inclusive support to local communities living within and around PAs by promoting and enhancing alternative livelihoods through community participation to reduce dependence on forest resources. The participatory processes that were piloted and upscaled in Satkosia Tiger Reserve have helped park managers and policy makers, for the first time in Orissa, to understand and value 'Village Ecodevelopment' as an essential tool in PA management. The experience and lessons learnt have been formulated into guidelines and field manuals for use throughout the State's network of PAs, paving the way for meaningful participatory eco-development. This paper describes the participatory process and mechanisms evolved and upscaled to engage with local communities in eco-development partnerships; defines the principles and mechanisms that underpin such partnerships; and demonstrates how management interventions can be effectively and equitably prioritised towards those members of a community most dependent on forest resources in order to maximise biodiversity conservation. Lessons learned include the importance of developing a shared vision at the outset, joint government-community collaboration in building capacities, independent expert facilitation and long-term nurturing of participatory processes, provision of well-defined livelihood enhancement opportunities and experiential learning among all stakeholders.","journal":"Biodiversity","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

In addition, MPAs and their networks are often the core strategy for larger scale and more integrated forms of marine resource management that can lead to ecosystem-based management regimes for seascapes and eco-regions. This study conducted in 2008 documents the status of selected MPAs and MPA networks in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea, to better understand development and their level of success in the Coral Triangle. Findings reveal that substantial gaps exist between the theory and practice of creating functional MPA networks. Across these sites, biophysical and social science knowledge, required to build functional and effective MPAs or MPA networks, lagged behind substantially. Aspects that appeared to require the most attention to improve MPA network effectiveness included essential management systems, institutional arrangements, governance and sustainable financing. Common indicators of success such as increased fish catch and habitat quality parameters were consistently associated with several independent variables: sustainable financing for management, clarity of MPA network rules, enforcement by community level enforcers, local skills development, and involvement in management by local elected politicians, a functional management board, multi-stakeholder planning mechanisms and participatory biophysical assessments. Conclusions are that although considerable investments have been made in MPAs and potential MPA networks in the Coral Triangle, management effectiveness is generally poor throughout the region and that not many large, formally declared MPAs are well managed.

Since UNESCO first designated biosphere reserves in 1976, the network has grown to include 226 sites in 62 countries (December 1983 data), and is becoming a significant factor in efforts to achieve harmonious relationships between human societies and the ecosystems on which they depend. The biosphere reserves provide a symbolic and practical framework for human cooperation at the local, regional, and international levels to find solutions to interrelated environmental, land use, and socioeconomic problems. They also provide a basis for developing and coordinating scientific, educational, and management functions performed individually or severally by various types of legally protected areas.

{"author":"Greiner, R.; Stanley, O.","year":2013,"title":"More than money for conservation: Exploring social co-benefits from PES schemes","dAbstract":"Recent public policy approaches aimed at halting or reversing environmental decline have embraced market-based instruments (MBIs) including payments for environmental services (PES). A particular advantage of MBIs is cost efficiency as they exploit heterogeneity of opportunity costs of supply among competing providers of environmental services. PES schemes offer financial incentives to land owners and managers to engage in specified environmental maintenance and restoration activities. Such activities support natural capital and ecosystem services, which, in turn, generate human wellbeing. As this paper demonstrates PES schemes can also generate social co-benefits, which add to the total wellbeing gain achieved. This paper differentiates and illustrates - with particular reference to PES schemes involving Aboriginal people in northern Australia - three types of social co-benefits: 'type A' benefits accrue to the service provider as a direct result of the remuneration received, 'type B' benefits accrue to the service provider in the process of undertaking the service and are unrelated to remuneration, and 'type C' benefits represent the broader flow-on effects associated with types A and B benefits. The paper concludes that government PES investment into social co-benefit can provide a socially efficient and environmentally effective investment strategy in the absence of opportunity cost differential and the presence of extreme social disadvantage of service providers.

Two case studies, each at a different scale, are presented. First, the N'hambita Community Carbon Project in Mozambique, a REDD+ project, promoted agro-forestry and reforestation activities along with alternative livelihoods. Second, the Sloping Lands Conversion Programme (SLCP) in China is a national-level reforestation scheme to supply watershed services. Impacts on the poor are addressed through the 'lens' of a rural household allocating its labour supply to different income sources. Four aspects of REDD+ policy are discussed: the incentives necessary for ensuring the cost-effective, long-run sustainability of both carbon sinks and incomes; the implications for forest conservation, in particular biodiversity; the need for scaling up carbon sequestration activities in order to minimise carbon leakage; and, the possibilities to maximise the participation of the poor and alleviate poverty. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of using appropriate methodologies for correct evaluation of policy impacts on incomes.

Data from two neighbouring Maasai group ranches in the wildlife dispersal area of Amboseli and Tsavo National Parks (Kenya) indicated one ranch generated considerable wildlife revenues from a tourist operation and community trust while the other received no direct benefits from wildlife. The overall attitude to wildlife on the ranch with wildlife revenues was significantly more positive, but attitudes within the ranch varied significantly, depending on both costs from wildlife and perception of the distribution of wildlife revenues. Ordinal logistic regression analyses showed that it was not the amount of revenue received or the scale of costs from wildlife which determined people's attitudes, but simply the presence or absence of wildlife benefits.

These practitioner case studies were then compared and contrasted with the findings of the research teams. It is hoped that the developed matrix may be useful to researchers in further focusing research, understanding core characteristics of effective and sustainable CBNRM, providing practitioners with a framework for developing new CBNRM initiatives for managing the commons, and providing a potential resource for academic institutions during their evaluation of their practitioner-focused environmental management and leadership curriculum.","journal":"Environmental Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

We focus on institutional changes associated with a national marine protected area network in Palau through which national government and NGOs gain influence in local decision-making processes. Influence is gained through an attempt to scale up common-pool resource governance to an ecologically-relevant spatial scale in an effort to protect coral reef resilience and biodiversity across Palau. An institutional approach informed by scalar politics brings into focus potential tradeoffs between organizing governance reform around ecologically versus institutionally relevant scales. Our analysis suggests that prioritization of ecologically-relevant scales in institutional reform resulted in nested but less polycentric institutional arrangements governing the network. We conclude that less distributed decision-making in the overall nested governance system could threaten the sustainability and resilience of coral reefs in the long-term by constraining institutional innovation and diversity. Results demonstrate the potential for interdisciplinary dialog to advance the research frontier on multi-level governance for large common pool resources.

This study, in a remote communal area and State Forest in the Eastern Cape, sought to understand the importance of forest products to local users, together with the relationships between key stakeholders and institutions involved in use and management of State Forest resources. The importance of the Reserve in local peoples' livelihood strategies was clearly revealed but, in the absence of a functional, locally legitimate management body, the Reserve is being over-exploited, with local villagers and outsiders capitalising on low forest rents and lack of enforcement of rules. A de facto 'open access' system is therefore in place. Intensive institution-building is necessary for any participatory management system to be successful, including provisions to: â€¢ Transfer power to the community management body clearly and without ambiguity - if necessary, providing a role within it for the traditional leadership; â€¢ Provide the community management body with adequate financial and other resources; â€¢ Assist the community management body to draw up management plans; â€¢ Propagate and enforce regulations; â€¢ Support the management body to enable it to provide effective, acceptable monitoring of forest use and regulation.

However, research on the financial rewards from NTFP collection and its contribution to sustainable development is equivocal. In a case study in the Periyar Tiger Reserve, India, we examined whether NTFP collection can solve livelihood problems by analysing revenues obtained from various NTFP species, estimating the economic returns to collectors from various social backgrounds, and exploring the attitudes of collectors towards their profession. We found that black damar resin from the tree Canarium strictum (61.3%) and mace from Myristica spp. (35.5%) were the most commonly collected NTFPs, and the most valuable NTFPs were honey from Apis cerana indica (USD 4.12 kg-1), cardamom Elettaria cardamomum (USD 3.67 kg-1) and Myristica spp. (USD 2.77 kg-1). Mean daily revenue from NTFP collection was USD 3.15 Â± SD 4.19 day-1, and the lowest daily revenues were earned by part-time collectors with low socio-economic status such as migrants, forest-dwellers or those without access to agricultural land. Most collectors (82%) did not wish to continue harvesting NTFPs if alternative livelihoods from agriculture could be provided, and none wanted their children to be NTFP collectors. Our findings suggest that, with respect to social justice, poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability, the role of NTFP collection in sustainable development is questionable.

Crop-raiding patterns have been investigated for decades, but understanding both social and ecological determinants remains a key challenge to defining realistic management options in a context of increasing human and elephant densities. Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, and its periphery, hosts one of the highest densities of free-ranging elephants. As scale is a critical element of ecological systems, we analysed the determinants of crop raiding at three spatial scales: the study area (217 households in 200 km 2), the village (30 fields in 14 km 2) and the edge of the refuge area (30 fields in less than 3 km 2). We combined foraging ecology with sociological approaches, including a participatory experiment, to understand the processes behind the susceptibility of subsistence farmers to crop raiding. Distance to refuge area was the most influential determinant in decreasing crop-raiding risk, with no damage occurring further than 4Â·4 km. We obtained consistent models between the three scales with high explanatory power for field damage at village and edge scales (94% and 68% respectively). Household density acted as an obstacle to elephants. Millet patches seemed to provide refuges, and thus promoted damage. The participatory experiment allowed rigorous testing of the efficiency of traditional guarding practices. The presence of people was crucial for guarding efficiency. More innovatively, we demonstrated the role of neighbours and the importance of cohesive guarding as a promising strategy of reducing crop loss at the edge, primarily in areas with a high density of elephant paths. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides evidence that multi-scale multidisciplinary approaches can unravel endogenous processes shaping human-elephant coexistence on the edge of protected areas. We believe that manipulating perceived risks for elephants, through mitigation methods based on the 'ecology of fear', and spatial organization of households, could create a 'soft fence' which, when combined with adequate incentives to farmers, promotes a better integration of the protected area in its territory.

We conducted semi-directive interviews at the household level (n =217) to document reasons for settlement in the area and villager's attitudes toward the PAs. We examined drivers of these attitudes relative to household typology, feelings about conservation, and concerns for the future with mixed linear models. Population increased by 61% from 2000 to 2010, a period of political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe. Forty-seven percent of immigrants were attracted by the area; others had been resettled from other villages or were returning to family lands. Attitudes toward PAs were generally positive, but immigrants attracted by the area and who used resources within the PA with fewer restrictions expressed more negative attitudes toward PAs. Household location, losses due to wild animals, and restrictions on access to natural resources were the main drivers of this negative attitude. Profit-seeking migrants did not expect these constraints and were particularly concerned with local overpopulation and access to natural resources. To avoid socio-ecological traps near PAs (i.e., unforeseen reduced adaptive capacity) integrated conservation should address mismatches between management policy and local expectations. This requires accounting for endogenous processes, for example, local socio-ecological dynamics and values that shape the coexistence between humans and wildlife.

The legal rights that local people have over resources in Protected Areas make it not only important but also crucial that communities be involved in monitoring. For this reason it is necessary to know the importance they attach to indicators, which, in turn could be considered as a reflection of the importance they attach to resources. For the research, a revision of available indicators was conducted. Nineteen of these indicators were selected as being applicable to the context of the Nevado de Toluca National Park. Interviews were conducted with the local people in three parts. The first part referred to their perception of the tourism activity in the area, the importance they attached to each of the indicators using a 5-point Likert scale, and their knowledge ability on the subjects of sustainable development or tourism. The second part of the interview consisted of a set of 12 photos they had to order according to the importance they attached to them. These pictures were representative of the resources found in the Nevado Park and the community. The last part of the interview was meant to help characterise the household as regard to their livelihoods. The paper concludes that more work needs to be done with indicators at the community level. Because of the technicalities of indicators, there exists the risk of leaving the local people at bay even though sustainable tourism has called for community involvement. Althoughinterviewees attached importance to the monitoring of resources it is equally important that they understand their possible participation in it.

The first case study is on agroforestry and silvo-herding systems located in the northern arid coast (Piura), where El Nino events, especially the 97/98 (December to May) one, had impacted the productivity of these systems. The second case study focused on in situ conservation of Andean crops and their wild parents in northern (Piura and Cajamarca) and central (Huanuco and Huancavelica) Andean mountain ecosystems of Peru. In this case study, not only the crop areas and the conservancy culture of the traditional farmers were addressed, but also their natural environment ie., the soils, fauna and plant communities (pastures, bushes and forests) that surround them. This guarantees the continuity of the conservancy activity of the Andean cultures and, therefore, of the northern and central Andean mountain semiarid ecosystems of Peru. The third case study is located in the southern coastal desert from Peru, on an oases ecosystem locally called as: \"Lomas\", which is inhabited by the Atiquipa peasant community. During the winter seasons (June-October), the Atiquipa Lomas support a strong presence of fog water, which is being \"harvested\" through \"atrapanieblas\" (\"fog catcher\") that permit fog water to precipitate with a noticeable increase in volume. This harvested water is used for reforestation of the community high zones for livestock and human consumption, as well as for food crops that contribute to the food security of the community. So, the bases for a sustainable use of the desert resources of the southern coast from Peru are being established. These three case studies show the successful measures for the sustainable land use in the arid coast and semiarid Andean mountains of Peru.","journal":"Book Section","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Participatory surveys were conducted with communities living near a communal woodland and a State Forest in the Eastern Cape province, South Africa, to determine the use and extent of management of woody resources under different tenure regimes. The results showed that all the respondents considered fuelwood as the most important wood product, followed by fencing material. More respondents living next to the State Forest felt that they could still easily find the products they needed from the forest compared to those living next to communal woodland, but respondents in both study areas believed they would not be able to easily find these products in future. Neither group was aware of current or future management strategies for the woody resources nor any well-defined natural resource management authorities at either village committee or government level. There were differing opinions as to who should be in charge of woodland and forest management in future, depending on the villagers' experience of government practices in the past. This study concluded that rural communities in the area will continue to use the forest and woodland resources in future, mainly for fuelwood, fencing, medicine and traditional ceremonies. Participatory resource management strategies for the two areas would encourage sustainable ways of using and managing the forest and woodland resources, including local cultivation of the most preferred indigenous tree and shrub species for the production of medicinal products, poles and other wooden commodities.

These forests supply nearly half the total wood requirements of the country and are dwindling rapidly; management of the forests to conserve the biological richness and maintain environmental services is therefore a difficult proposition. This predicament is further compounded by the dependency of rural people on a range of non-timber forest resources for their subsistence and income. A forestry master plan recently prepared for Sri Lanka has not given adequate recognition to the important role played by non-timber forest resources in rural livelihood. This oversight is primarily due to the lack of quantitative information to justify the role of non-timber forest resources in forestry sector development. Forestry policies that ignore these resources often anger local people, leading the villagers to vent their disapproval through destructive actions such as burning timber plantations. Long-term interdisciplinary research in ecology, reproductive and soil biology, ethnobiology, silviculture, rural sociology and resource economics in progress at Sinharaja attempts to address these questions of sustainable development of forest resources in an integrated mode. While research oriented toward conservation investigates both short- and long-term ecosystem dynamics in natural and modified forest stands, utilization-oriented research probes the impact of increased human disturbance, particularly the impact of rural communities on dwindling forest resources, as well as the effect of forest conservation on rural livelihood. These studies continue to seek alternative methods of forest management which are socially acceptable, economically viable, and ecologically sustainable for multiple uses. These methods will assist in the refinement of current forest policies, forestry planning, and the implementation of new policies and plans in Sri Lanka.

The Berau MPA of northeast Kalimantan is one of them. This paper shows how the establishment of the park boundaries and zoning affects local fishers' livelihoods. Particular attention is paid to the position of outsider fishers or andon, who have a legal right to access the resource rich fishing grounds. Decentralised district government legitimises outsider fisheries activities because andon fishing permits bring in fees as a contribution to the regional income (PAD or pendapatan asli daerah), while international environmental organisations and local fishers regard the outsider fishers as illegitimately entering the MPA to access resources they regard as their own. Thus, MPA boundaries appear to be highly permeable, with both local fishers and environmental NGOs seeing the presence of andon as illegitimate and illicit, despite being legal.

They provide foundations for life on earth through ecological functions, by regulating climate and water resources and serving as habitats for plants and animals. Forests also furnish a wide range of essential goods such as wood, food, fodder and medicines, in addition to opportunities for recreation, spiritual renewal and other services (FRA 2003). Forestland covers 21,188, 746 ha, which corresponds to approximately 27% of the surface area of Turkey (OGM 2007). Forests are among the most popular ecotourism destinations because of their unique values for tourists interested in nature in local values and culture. It is therefore critical to adopt a sustainable development approach in the management Of mountains and forests, where biodiversity must be conserved in the long term to minimize the negative impacts of tourism. This is increasingly being acknowledged by governmental institutions and non-governmental organizations in some areas of Turkey. We report here on the development of ecotourism and the support of local communities and other stakeholders in the Kure Mountains, emphasizing awareness-raising activities and benefits to the local economy.","journal":"Mountain Research and Development","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

When it comes to the management of these natural resources, gender inequality due to societal traditions could limit the ability of women to participate in policy-making, even when they are not formally excluded. This paper analyzes the effect of gender stratification on women's participation by undertaking an empirical study of a participatory environmental policy program in Indian villages. It endeavors to answer the question of how gender stratification affects participatory environmental policy-making. Using the case study of a community forestry program, it finds that women are still marginalized in decision-making, even in participatory environmental policies. Gender stratification continues to impinge upon forms of democratic decision-making in developing societies. Using facilitating policy tools that seek to empower such marginalized groups would be one way of making participation meaningful for all groups in society.

Face-to-face interviews, supported by structured questionnaires, were conducted to determine 1) sources of livelihood; 2) the impact of tourism; and 3) the readiness of rural communities to participate in income-generating activities. Farmers were keen to take up ecotourism and wanted to use the proceeds to increase their livestock herds. However, this would increase pressure on natural resources, causing land degradation. Additionally, income from ecotourism may also lead, in the long run, to social inequality in remote communities. To prevent environmental stress in protected areas, social inequity and potential land degradation, newly generated wealth from ecotourism needs to be appropriately invested by the stakeholders.

This intensive management approach involves the re-introduction of wild dogs into suitable conservation areas and periodic translocations among them. To assess the attitudes towards re-introduced wild dogs, we conducted a questionnaire survey of multiple stakeholders-local community members, private landowners and tourists-in and around Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), one of the meta-population conservation areas. Here, we document conflicting human interests over the re-introduced wild dogs. Tourists in HiP, on the one hand, expressed overwhelmingly positive opinions about wild dogs across personal details of the respondents, but especially after having seen free-ranging wild dogs. On the other hand, we found misconceptions and perceptions that were more negative among the rural population around HiP, again largely independent of personal details of the participants, although educated respondents voiced more favourable views of wild dogs. These negative attitudes were in particular due to perceived and real threats of livestock losses. In a follow-up questionnaire survey, we also discovered apparent shortcomings of a previous short-lived conservation education programme among the local communities adjacent to HiP. Consequently, the mitigation of the conflict between wild dogs and rural people requires an understanding of the conditions under which livestock predation occurs, the encouragement of practices that prevent such predation, and increasing local tolerance of co-existence with wild dogs through both economic and non-monetary incentive schemes as well as continued conservation education.

Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.

The overexploitation of inshore fishing resources is a major problem in Viet Nam's coastal areas along the Mekong Delta. As a result, the Catch per Unit of Effort of small-scale fishing enterprises has decreased, undermining the sustainability of livelihoods of fishing families. The paper focuses on livelihoods' strategies and diversification in the context of overexploitation and exhaustion of near-shore resources in relation to fishery policies. The results show that overexploitation is unavoidable in near-shore waters because of the lack of enforcement of fishery regulations for offshore vessels and the limitation of alternative sources of income and opportunities for livelihood diversification for small-scale fishers. The present policies to prevent overexploitation need to be reconciled with livelihood sustainability and fishery management, resource conservation and socio-economic goals.

The Vietnamese government has promoted shrimp farming as a way to reduce poverty, provide employment opportunities and increase exports to support economic development. The shrimp farming system, however, is economically and ecologically risky and may negatively influence the environment and the sustainability of local people's livelihoods. Because very little is known about the diversity of strategies people employ to deal with these risks, a study was performed in the Mekong Delta across four shrimp farming systems: (1) improved extensive non-forest, (2) mixed mangrove-shrimp, (3) intensive and (4) clustered intensive. The risks and livelihood strategies that were encountered differed systematically across the four farming systems. It was found that the uncertainties that the shrimp farmers faced include limited access rights to the mangrove forest, crop failure due to regular occurrence of shrimp disease, high investment costs and volatile markets for shrimp. Shrimp farmers have created several strategies for coping with these uncertainties, including redesigning farms, producing salt, changing the species farmed from Penaeus monodon to Penaeus vannamei, becoming involved in a cooperative cluster, integrating aquaculture and agriculture, and farming shrimp by organic standards.

Policies on land allocation, land tenure and use-rights are important since they potentially promote sustainable mangrove-shrimp management. Forest management policy in Vietnam has been changed to promote equality of benefit sharing among stakeholders and devolved State forest management to the household level. However, to what extent its implementation can stimulate both mangrove conservation and livelihood improvement is still being debated. We use access and its social mechanisms to investigate how State Forest Companies (FC) and farmers can benefit from mangrove exploitation. The study was conducted from September 2008 to August 2010 using both qualitative and quantitative methods and using a participatory approach. After group discussions and in-depth interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, we interviewed 86 households in four communities using structured questionnaires. Results show the imbalance in access to finance, markets, and differences in authority between the two actors, farmers and FC.

The devolution of forest management and benefit sharing in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam","dAbstract":"Large parts of the world's remaining mangrove forest are lost due to the expansion of shrimp farming in coastal areas. Current forest allocation and subcontracting policies of the Vietnamese government with respect to the devolution of forest management and participation of local people in sustainable forest management reflect both environmental and economic concerns. The paper aims at investigating how the devolution of rights over forestland and benefit sharing mechanisms are related to actual rights and the distribution of benefits of forest management practices. The findings show that farmer's decision-making over mangroves is very much influenced by shrimp farming since the income from mangroves is very low compared to that from shrimp. Farmer's decision making over forest is very much influenced by the way in which the benefit sharing policy is implemented by the state-owned forestry companies and management boards. However, their attitudes towards mangrove plantation and protection are far from negative. The study supports the claim that shrimp farmers may well be able to plant, protect and manage mangroves if they have more rights and responsibilities over forests and are able to benefit more from the production of mangroves. In this way more sustainable management of mangrove forests may be promoted. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","journal":"Ocean and Coastal Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Differences between the north and the south","dAbstract":"One would hypothesize that the Common Fisheries Policy, as the umbrella framework for fisheries management in the EU would have the greatest impact on fishers' communities across Europe. There are, however, biological, economic, social, and political factors, which vary among fishing communities that can affect how these communities react to changes. This paper explores the links between institutional arrangements and ecological dynamics in two European inshore fisheries socio-ecological systems, using a resilience framework. The Mediterranean small-scale fishers do not seem to have been particularly affected by the Common Fisheries Policy regulations but appear affected by competition with the politically strong recreational fishers and the invasion of the rabbit fish population. The inshore fishers along the East coast of Scotland believe that their interests are not as sufficiently protected as the interests of their offshore counterpart. Decisions and initiatives at global, EU, and sometimes national level, tend to take into account those fisheries sectors which have a national economic importance. A socio-ecological analysis can shift the focus from biological and economic aspects to more sustainable long-term delivery of environmental benefits linked to human wellbeing.

Thus, identifying fishers' regulatory preferences in economic terms can assist the creation of more acceptable, workable and sustainable policies. The Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA) method was adapted from its original application as a marketing tool to identify fishers' most and least preferred regulatory obligations in terms of the impact these obligations have on their income. Significant differences were identified in fishers' preferences that depended on the regulatory measures fishers operated under at the time of the study (which related to the fishery and the region in which the fishers belonged). All fishers agreed that access to resources, i.e. how much access they have within a certain sea area was most important for their income. However, there were differences in fishers' preferences with regards to the majority of regulatory measures; inshore fishers preferred restrictions related to the category 'Days at Sea' rather than 'Total Allowable Catches', and vice versa for offshore fishers. Fishers' preferences varied most for 'Enforcement and Compliance' related obligations with the general trend being that fishers tend to prefer the measure with which they are most accustomed. This paper emphasises the need for additional knowledge at a more localised level on fishers' regulatory perceptions. Such knowledge will allow regulators to account for fishers' perceptions and attitudes towards regulatory measures when formulating legislation. Accounting for perceptions and attitudes of the relevant stakeholders will assist the successful implementation of new measures by providing relevant incentives and mitigation measures.

Among the issues being confronted are the need for foresters to gain new skills in managing human resources, design forest use systems which are both productive and sustainable, and to insure that the benefits of these systems are disrtibuted more equitably. In the last quarter of a century reserved forest lands in Thailand have been seriously degraded through deforestation, overcutting, and the illegal encroachment of poor and landless farmers. To counter these forces the government proposed two new forest management programs in 1975 which would grant certificates of use or limited land use rights to some degraded forest land in areas of national reserved forest. This paper examines the use of this policy in the Forest Village and National Forest Land Allotment Projects in northeast Thailand. Since their implementation in the Dong Mun National Reserved Forest 8 years ago, these projects have been plagued with conflicts over de jure and de facto land rights, public misperceptions about the government's grant of amnesty to illegal forest residents, problems controlling immigration, and the small 2.4 ha land allotments given to project participants. These conditions have produced unequal access to and distribution of land, allotment of land poorly suited for agriculture, the destruction of reforestation plots, continued degradation of reserved forest, and a pronounced pattern of social and economic inequality within and between the villages participating in both projects. We argue that these problems are fundamentally caused by government failures to correctly assess population pressures on land in the northeast and to modify program design to better fit community needs, capabilities, and insure equitability in the distribution of benefits.

This paper identifies drivers of FMNR adoption and assesses its impacts on rural households in the Region of Maradi, Niger, an area covering 42,000 square kilometers. The results show that 26% of households practice a form of FMNR involving both pruning and protecting woody vegetation. Adoption is strongly linked to soil type, market access, and the education level of the head of household. FMNR raises household income and increases crop diversity, household migration rates, and the density and diversity of trees on farmland. It is estimated that FMNR raises the annual gross income of the region by between 17 and 21 million USD and has contributed an additional 900,000 to 1,000,000 trees to the local environment. These findings support the value of continued promotion of FMNR as an inexpensive means of enhancing rural livelihoods and an attractive alternative to reforestation efforts relying on tree planting.

{"author":"Hagos, F.; Holden, S.","year":2006,"title":"Tenure security, resource poverty, public programs, and household plot-level conservation investments in the highlands of northern Ethiopia","dAbstract":"Land degradation poses a serious problem for the livelihoods of rural producers. Furthermore, there is rarely enough private investment taking place to commensurate the scale of the problem. This article examines the role of tenure insecurity, resource poverty, risk and time preferences, and community-led land conservation on differentiated patterns of household investment in land conservation in northern Ethiopia. We control for biophysical, household characteristics, market access conditions, and village level factors. Investments in soil bunds and stone terraces are specifically studied so as to capture the link between these various factors and the durability of conservation investments. We introduce the distinction between the determinants of the decision to invest and how much to invest in conservation. Regression results show that publicly led conservation programs seem to significantly stimulate private investment. A host of plot-level variables and household perceptions of returns on conservation investments, expressed in terms of perceived improvements in land quality and increased crop yields, were found to be critical to the decision to invest and intensify soil conservation. The evidence on the significance of households' attitudes toward risk aversion suggests the important role of risk and the household's risk-bearing capacity in the decision to intensify conservation measures. At the same time, tenure security indicators and households' resource endowments (resource poverty) had weaker effects in increasing willingness to invest and the level of investment made. The policy implications of these results point to the importance of agricultural research and extension efforts that target technologies which reduce household risk and poverty while enabling sustainable investments in conservation measures by individual households.

{"author":"Haigh, M. J.","year":2000,"title":"Headwater control: Despatches from the research front","dAbstract":"Headwater Control is about integrated land management. Effective headwater management requires better information, better technologies, better management structures, change in land husbandry and direct engineering interventions. Headwater regions often waste their resources. In Jammu and Kashmir, 40% (and in South Africa and Iranian Azerbaijan 60%) of the water resource runs to waste. Azerbaijan's planners believe that 25% could be collected for agriculture. In Xinjiang, China, by contrast, over-utilisation of the headwater resources in the Tarim Basin has caused desertification and large-scale farmland abandonment downstream Better systems of water resource accounting are required. Eventually, the Lesotho Highlands Water Project may generate 25% of that nation's foreign exchange earnings. Acidification is linked to the human impact in headwaters. Previously, pH was controlled by climatic, lithologic, edaphic and biologic factors. New Japanese work stresses the role of the weathered layer beneath the soils of tropical steeplands in moderating the hydrologic impacts of forestation and acid precipitation Elsewhere, pollution plays a critical role, especially the deposition of air pollutants. Time trends of NO3- and SO42- deposition may be dwarfed by natural geographical variations within a smalt basin. However, the chief agencies are decreasingly SO42-, increasingly NO3- and more generally agricultural chemicals and other human wastes. Riverine microbial biofilms act as both sinks and sources for pollutants. In Canada, effective prevention of non-point-source pollution required a compromise between the net welfare of farmers, the wider non-farm community and the environment. Better systems of water quality management are required. The riparian zone is often counted critical. Fragmentation of both the riparian zone and its management rank among the most serious challenges for land managers. However, while restoring riparian vegetation reduces sediment loads and increases the biodiversity of affected rivers, it may not mitigate acidification. Mathematical models for predicting runoff from alpine catchments are evaluated. USDAHL with GIS, HEC-1 and RUNOFF-5 are generally satisfactory and HYRROM is useful for engineering. Empirical studies show that forests moderate hydrological and erosional processes. In Serbia, 15-years study in steep headwater basins finds that forest covers > 70%, rather than < 49%, yield smaller flood peaks and provide a more sustained flow (dry for 13.4 days/year-1 vs. 121.4 or more). In Japan's mountain headwaters, reforestation reduces water losses. Here, increased evapotranspiration is compensated by decreased deep seepage. In Alaska, tree roots prove as important as pore water pressure in regulating landsliding on steep dopes with shallow soils. Soil erosion remains a major problem. In Brazil, regional estimates of soil loss were a seventh of those due to rill and gully erosion in fields under conventional tillage. In Lithuania, soil depth declines ranging from 0.12 - 0.94 m and soil fertility declines ranging from 22% to 63% are reported. In the Himalaya soil nutrient deficiencies are widespread and agricultural inputs are inadequate to the maintenance of fertility levels. Overgrazing, forest conversion, the harvesting of wild medicinal herbs, road construction and mining cause soil degradation and permit ecological invasion by alien weed species. The situation of the headwater farmer, struggling with land degradation, contrasts with that of the padi farmer downstream, whose fields are enriched with soils and nutrients lost from the uplands. Elsewhere, sediment and agrochemical pollution causes problems downstream In Canada, conservation tillage proves best pollution control practice for both the farmers and non-farm community. In Brazil, rill and gully erosion was eliminated by the adoption of no-till agriculture. In Lithuania, returning steeper slopes to pasture reduced soil losses to zero. Cover management reduced soil losses in Algeria Small grain cultivation reduced soil losses to a half or a third of bare fallow. In Japan, stone mulches prove effective against erosion. In Yunnan, China, contour cultivation with straw mulching is more effective against erosion than contour cultivation and, in descending order, inter-cropping, no-till, polythene mulching or conventional agriculture. Soil losses are widely linked to individual aggressive rainfall events. In Nepal the two most severe storms each year commonly account for >80% of total soil loss. In the Himalaya and Sierra Nevada, overgrazing, and in Brazil, India, and China, agricultural extension, are other major causes. In Serbia, headwater depopulation reduced soil losses, Headwater Control requires improved land husbandry. The empowerment of local communities is the best route. UNCED's Chapter 13 echoes the MC belief in working with local communities to match economic land use with land capability. New participatory institutional frameworks, based on public trust doctrines and 'basin citizenship', are introduced.","journal":"","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

National and international assessments are increasingly highlighting the unsustainable use of earth's natural resources in the face of population increase, growing material affluence and global change. In all likelihood, the use and degradation of natural resources will continue. 2. In contrast to resource depletion, the concept of natural capital emphasises how the environment is an asset to be managed, to ensure that the benefits which flow from it are sustained for future generations. These benefits are the ecosystem goods and services upon which all people rely for their continued survival and well-being both now and, ideally, in perpetuity. 3. Despite their importance, the evidence-base and quantitative understanding of links between biodiversity, ecosystem function and ecosystem services are insufficient to allow informed use and management. Moreover, the concepts of natural capital and ecosystem services are insufficiently mainstream to influence decisions that currently favour the production of food and fibre rather than less tangible services such as climate regulation, air and water purification, pollination or the contributions of environment to health. 4. There are specific challenges to ecological science in this interdisciplinary endeavour: specifically, to develop frameworks for identifying and monitoring natural capital; to parameterise factors affecting ecosystem services and their resilience to change; to integrate the complexity of ecological systems into ecosystem service valuation; and to characterise the synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services in different management and policy scenarios. 5 Synthesis and applications. The five papers in this Special Profile exemplify just some of the leading work through which ecologists in the UK are contributing nationally and internationally to these needs, stemming from the UK National Ecosystem Assessment - the first national scale exercise of its type in the world. We expect a major, worldwide increase in work on ecosystem services and natural capital in future as decisions on ecosystem use of management are squeezed increasingly between the needs of exploitation and protection.","journal":"Journal of Applied Ecology","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Case studies from mexico and Brazil","dAbstract":"Decentralization of forest governance has been promoted as a way to conserve forests more effectively, while also improving rural and forest-dependent livelihoods. Prior to assessing the consequences of this decentralization trend, there is a need to critically examine the degree to which decentralization of forest management decision making is actually happening. In particular, it is unclear whether communities are securing legal authority and/or decision-making power over the forests on which they depend. This study uses case studies of community forestry in Brazil and Mexico to examine the amount of decision-making power communities and smallholders have received over forest resources. A framework for assessment is developed that identifies criteria of relevance to community members' rights and day-to-day activities. We found that in both countries the government maintains significant control over forest resources through heavy regulation of extraction, but that communities have increasing control over day-to-day forest management decisions. We conclude by posing questions on the appropriate levels of decentralization for optimal outcomes. Â© 2012 by the author(s).

However, a number of challenges face communities wanting to initiate or maintain formal, community-based forest management. Through a grounded theory approach, this paper uses three case studies of community forest management models in the eastern Amazon to create a framework showing challenges faced by communities at different phases of formal management. The framework shows that, in the development phase, four root problems (land ownership, knowledge acquisition, community organization, and adequate capital) need to be addressed to obtain legal management permission. With this permission in hand, further challenges to operationalization are presented (deterring illegal loggers, maintaining infrastructure, obtaining necessary managerial skills and accessing markets). The interrelatedness of these challenges emphasizes that all challenges need to be addressed in a holistic manner for communities to maintain a profitable and self-sufficient operation. This contradicts current development approaches that only address part of this framework. The framework proposed here can be used as a starting point for community forestry initiatives in other regions.

On Langkawi Island, the formation of co-operative community resource management, Komuniti Pengurusan Sumber Perikanan (KPSP), or, formerly, fishermen economic groups, Kumpulan Ekonomi Nelayan (KEN), in 2001 is a significant attempt to emphasise the value of local involvement in natural resource management. This article aims to examine the importance of local community engagement in resource management through participation in selected fishing communities on the island. To this purpose, concepts from transformative learning theory are applied to understand how interactions among adults, through their participation in resource management, can promote learning and social change. The findings indicate a number of motivators and challenges to education, such as opportunities for dialogues, leadership and changes in behaviour, that occur at the community level. In conclusion, this study concurs that active local participation in resource management would allow members of the community to learn about natural resources and that such learning can lead to concrete actions on the ground towards sustainable solutions. Therefore, further research must focus on improving the forms of local participation in resource management to provide space for more and more effective education.

Although efforts to protect and manage these forests have increased in recent decades, forest loss continues. The last decade and a half has seen considerable research on reforestation with native species in Mesoamerica, including both biophysical and social aspects. Advances in knowledge have led to increasingly sophisticated reforestation treatments as well as novel ways of deriving forest goods and services from human dominated landscapes. This Special Issue includes articles produced as the result of a conference held in Panama City, Panama in January 2010 with the goal to summarize the state of knowledge of native species reforestation and associated ecosystems services in Mesoamerica. The introduction concludes with a call for continued research, including a mechanistic understanding of tree interactions with the biophysical environment in order to advance or knowledge of ecosystem services and their interactions. Results from these and other studies aimed at socioeconomic aspects of reforestation are critical to land use planning.

The approach is centred on a broad set of policy evaluation criteria that merge traditional economic and sectoral goals and broader social issues related to health and income distribution. The approach is inspired by institutional economics and development paradigms that emphasise human wellbeing, resource access, empowerment, and the arrived freedoms. It is outlined how indicators of wellbeing can be used to assess policies that integrate development and climate change policy objectives, and this approach is discussed in comparison with other work that rather have been inspired by sustainable development aspects of manmade, natural, and social capital. The experiences and results from case studies of development and climate that have done a first attempt to use human wellbeing indicators are reported and discussed. The studies include work from India, China, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Senegal. A number of policy examples in the energy-, food-, and water sectors in these studies have shown up to demonstrate numerous linkages between development policies and climate change. Various analytical tools have been used in the studies including quantitative and qualitative scenario work as well as detailed micro-based analysis. The methodological conclusion that can be drawn from these studies, is that it is possible to apply wellbeing indicators to the more detailed policy assessment, but a link to more general national and regional scenario work is not yet established.

The local people of these communities are mostly CaiÃ§ara, the native inhabitants of southeastern Brazilian coast, in an Atlantic forest area. The miscegenation of Amerindians, European colonizers, and African Brazilians gave rise to the CaiÃ§ara people, whose subsistence was originally based on small-scale itinerant agriculture, small-scale fishery, and some extraction of forest products. Their livelihoods activities changed through time: agricultural practices were gradually abandoned, while fishing grew in importance. Recently, tourism-related jobs and the extraction of non-timber vegetal resources acquired a key role in the estuarine CaiÃ§ara livelihood.

With inspiration from Henri Lefebvre's theory on the production of space, it examines dialectical processes of the production of conservation space empirically. Two arenas of conflict: fencing and punitive actions against conservation transgressors are discussed in terms of state power in its relational engagement with local space. Spatial conflicts emerge through tensions between the imposed objectives for the conservation of ecological World Heritage-And the subjective space of users and inhabitants. Market-based modernisation and economic growth strategies, which view land as a commodity, rather than as a social-ecological resource for livelihood generation, perpetuate historical insecurities through the alienation of local people from both land and management practices. Other alienating effects include the socially differentiated effects of new rules of governance, the reshaping of old ethnic identities as a result of envisaged benefits from ecotourism and the imposition of new social-ecological values.

On fallow land, an average of 2,416 trees/ha was recorded; on cropped land, an average of 56 trees/ha was recorded. Trees within cropped land are mostly regenerated naturally, and farmers demonstrated knowledge and interest in tree management. The current development strategies poorly acknowledge the value to local farmers of indigenous tree species and the local tree management practices.

Wetlands viz. river, canal, haor, baor, beel, floodplains, lake and coastal estuaries are the repository of the fish and other aquatic resources. As an agricultural economic based country, about 75% rural people are dependent on wetlands resources. Wetlands provide livelihood security in the form of a food, household materials, fodder for cattle and kitchen fuel. Socio-cultural events are also based on the nature and seasonal variation of wetlands. Apart from these, wetlands are also supporting navigation across the country. Wetlands swamps were the habitats for innumerable species of flora and fauna. Mainly extension of agriculture and dwellings for increasing population, unwise and excessive construction of roads and dams, industrialization and rapid urbanization play significant roles for degradation and conversion of wetlands. The existing management, i.e., leasing system of the haor from the government is allowing the lessee to over-exploit the resources and restrict the resource bases from the access of local villagers. People of the haor areas are thus facing a tremendous crisis against the availability of fish, fuel wood, housing and thatching materials. Homesteads and even the villages are in increasing vulnerability by the increased wave erosion during the monsoon since natural barrier of wave action, i.e., swamp forests, are degraded. Community based wetlands resource management projects have been commenced for the restoration of haor ecosystem. Community participation has been ensured during development of the action plan of Pagnar and Sanuar-Dakuar haor. Selection of indigenous aquatic plant species, development of management plan and benefit sharing mechanism have been delineated in the participatory action plan development workshop. Already vanished and degraded swamp forests have been restored through plantation and allowing natural succession on the kanda (raised land in the vast haor) in the project area. Priority areas have been identified based on ecological potential and community interest for plantation. About 250 thousands of aquatic plants such as hizal (Barringtonia acutangula), karoch (Pongamia pinnata) and Barun (Crataeva magna) have been planted in 80 ha of degraded area. In addition, locally vulnerable swamp reeds have been planted in some parts of the haor to foster the restoration process. Community interests and consensus are privileged in the whole process of restoration despite their inherent benefits for enhancing the daily livelihood. Restored swamp forest will contribute to promoting the habitats for biodiversity as well as support for the enhancement of the livelihood security of rural haor people.

M.","year":2013,"title":"Efficacy of rights-based management of small pelagic fish within an ecosystems approach to fisheries in South Africa","dAbstract":"South Africa's small pelagics fishery is moving towards a management strategy using an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), with rights-based management (RBM) as the key rights allocation system. While EAF strives to balance between, among others, ecological and social-economic objectives, RBM is driving the sector towards economic efficiency. Within EAF itself, there are still underlying mismatches between the two top objectives, 'human wellbeing' and 'ecological wellbeing', in effect requiring a better balance between these objectives than there is currently. For example, fishers do not believe they should be competing with marine mammals and birds for allocation of the resource, yet this is one of the primary trade-offs that have to be made when setting the annual total allowable catches (TACs) under EAF. A balance between the two objectives could be achieved through acceptable trade-offs between them among all stakeholders within inclusive governance. Implementation of RBM has had both positive and negative effects on the objectives for EAF. Of concern are the negative effects of RBM on human wellbeing. For example, fishers feel that RBM has weakened their bargaining position, thereby reducing their benefits. In addition, RBM has resulted in job losses and insecurity of employment within the fisheries sector. The most affected have been the most vulnerable - the low level workers - who ought to be the key beneficiaries of RBM. Thus prioritising and protecting vulnerable groups and fishing communities need careful consideration when creating RBM, even in the context of EAF. Rights-based management has also had negative effects on ecological wellbeing through practices such as increased dumping and 'high grading' as part of industry's drive for increased efficiency under RBM. Whereas scientists believe that variability is largely due to environmental conditions, fishers strongly feel that dumping, high grading and high fishing pressure are the main factors. One of the positive aspects of RBM has been improved understanding among rights-holders and fishers of the need to consider other organisms in the TAC and to protect these through establishment of marine protected areas, island perimeter closures and limiting bycatch, thereby impacting positively on ecological wellbeing.

A questionnaire survey and informal interviews are conducted among 74 households, in three villages, in and around the park. The survey reveals that almost all people knew about the existence and the laws of the park. Many people recognize and understand the importance of the global conservation of the park. In addition, most people agree that local participation is indispensable for conservation. Furthermore, people tend to be eager to use secondary forests or scrubs rather than primary forests or old secondary, recognizing the use of forest ecosystems in a sustainable manner. However, many people would like to claim the right to use the forests and lands within the park. People are only interested in meeting their daily needs from the park at the moment. Fortunately, they hope to participate in the park administration and are also enthusiastic about cooperating with related stakeholders including government authorities and NGOs. The results of the survey can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the local community does not have enough information about the park and, consequently, people only follow the compulsory laws. Secondly, local conservation knowledge and the global objectives of park management cannot be harmonized because of the lack of information and agreement concerning the park between local people and government authorities. People do not have certain incentives to conserve biodiversity, as they cannot get any benefits from the part. Thirdly, in spite of these adverse findings, it largely depends on the government authorities' capabilities whether the integrated park management can succeed or not, because people still have positive attitudes towards local participation.","journal":"Journal of Forest Research","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

In order to protect precious biodiversity on earth, discussions on this topic are carried out internationally, and protected areas are increasing throughout the world. Because local dwellers often occupy the areas which are also designated as protected areas, the rights of those people should be ensured. While preservationists and government authorities have achieved biodiversity conservation and succeeded in acquiring foreign currency by establishing protected areas and eco-tourism in them, those did not contribute to the economic benefits of local dwellers, but rather, jeopardized their customary lifestyles. These different attitudes towards nature by different stakeholders are causing conflicts between biodiversity and culture.

It is fundamental for forest certification to maintain the economic benefits for certified local sellers and balance conservation goals with increasing local incomes. This study explores how FSC certification of a community-based forest enterprise in Southeast Sulawesi in Indonesia could improve effectively field situations of community forest management and strengthen local peoples' financial benefits and social perceptions towards conserving forests. FSC group certification was introduced in the area of teak community forest of several villages in 2005. Because of local strong interest in group certification, the size of certified forests, the number of group certification members and the amount of certified wood harvested gradually increased. The support of a local NGO and an international NGO contributed towards successful establishment of group certification and establishment of a small-scale forestry enterprise producing certified wood in a sustainable manner. These NGOs played important roles in establishing strong relationships between producers and consumers, strengthening local forest management institutions, and promising social and economic benefits to the local people.

A so-called hill tribe problem has been officially identified as a result of the slash-and-burn cultivation and other perceived problems, such as opium poppy cultivation, illegal immigration, and the suspicion of disloyalty to the state. This has created distrust and tension between the groups and authorities. The local conflict has recently been related to the dilemma of conserving the forest from all human interference, while many people live and make their livelihood within and adjacent to the protected areas. Furthermore, as the results imply, strictly protected areas and reforestation have also increased the competition over land and natural resources and, thereby, the likelihood of local conflicts. The scarcity and pollution of water, illegal logging, and poor fire control have contributed to the conflicts between local communities. The conflicts between the local communities and officials have been nourished by political and public discussions. Using definitions and terms with negative connotations and ignoring the heterogeneity between the groups or labeling some groups as malevolent have increased distrust and strengthened existing stereotypical images. Conflict resolution starts with efforts toward better mutual understanding, and changes in structures and attitudes are necessary. Local cooperation, utilization of traditional methods, and local institutions are central to conflict solving.

Throughout much of the developing world growth of human populations is occurring in part as a result of a lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services, and this is having profoundly negative impacts on biodiversity and natural resource-dependent livelihoods. We present experiences of the incorporation of sexual and reproductive health services within a pre-existing community-based marine conservation initiative in Madagascar as part of an integrated population, health and environment (PHE) programme. Our results demonstrate the considerable demand for, and lack of social barriers to, the introduction of sexual and reproductive health services in this region. These findings emphasize the mutually beneficial synergies, supporting both public health and conservation objectives, which can be created by integrating sexual and reproductive health services into more conventional biodiversity conservation activities. This PHE approach demonstrates the inextricable link between reproductive health and resource use by providing practical, immediate and lasting benefits to public health, gender equity, food security and biodiversity conservation.

Stakeholder perceptions about sustainable use in three communities near Cahuita National Park, Costa Rica","dAbstract":"The decline in populations of sea turtles has heightened controversy between two contrasting strategies for their sustainable management: consumptive use versus non-consumptive use. This study investigates perceptions held by individuals in three communities bordering a marine protected area in Costa Rica about consumptive and non-consumptive use of sea turtles on nesting beaches to determine how best to achieve sustainable management of the species. Face-to-face interviews (n=48 community members and n=8 key informants) were conducted in three communities (Cahuita Town, Hone Creek, and Playa Negra) during April and May 2009. The research found that in each community, residents' perceptions about consumptive and non-consumptive use were divided into four categories: norm-activated pro- and anti-environmentalism; and rationally self-interested pro- and anti-environmentalism. Given this perceptual diversity, it seems clear that no single management strategy would work successfully across all three communities, but that customised management measures were required to manage sea turtle populations in each area. The wider implication of this study is that there is no simple panacea for dealing with declining populations of sea turtles: each situation is sui generis, requiring measures tailored exclusively to its particular circumstances.

Key ecological factors discussed here include: reproduction, natural regeneration, growth, ecosystem functions, and biodiversity conservation. Four models of sustainable tropical forestry are described: 1) industrial timber production based on the PORTICO company in Costa pica that owns and manages its production forest and makes a substantive investment in research. 2) Community-based timber production using the Yanesha Forestry Cooperative in the Peruvian Amazon as an example of local empowerment over the protection and use of forests. This Coop has a local processing facility that enables most of the timber to be marketed, and it uses an innovative strip-cut management system that promotes excellent natural regeneration of native tree species. 3) Community-based production of nontimber forest products depends on local rights of access or tenure to tropical forests. However, more information is needed on harvestable levels and management techniques as local preferences move from subsistence uses to commercial production. 4) Locally controlled nature tourism is touted as the most benign use of tropical forests, but local communities receive minimal economic returns and have little say in prioritizing development objectives.","journal":"Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Forest fragments and wetlands scattered throughout the agricultural landscape provide important natural resources for local people. These forest fragments, however, also provide habitat for animals that raid crops and threaten local agricultural practices, leading to human-wildlife conflict in the buffer zone of the park. Using a geographically stratified, random sampling technique to select study sites, 130 households outside Kibale were interviewed to understand human-agriculture-wildlife conflicts and how these problems vary spatially and demographically. Primates were the most common taxa associated with crop raiding, with vervet and redtail monkeys ranked as the worst crop raiders overall. Baboons and elephants were also problematic in agricultural areas proximate to the park boundary. Despite the problems reported, most respondents prefer to live closer to forest fragments and wetlands because of greater access to natural resources.

Expulsion, exclusion and the imposition of external control are dominant themes, resulting in negative responses to parks, particularly those that represent hard-edged so-called fortress conservation. Our research in the densely populated area around a mid altitude forest park in western Uganda found an alternate narrative in which, despite its hard-edged fortress features, most people view Kibale National Park favourably. Based on a geographically random sample in two agricultural areas neighbouring the Park, our results indicate that most households felt they benefit from the Park and only a small proportion cited negative impacts. Rather than direct economic returns, the benefits most commonly noted by respondents can be characterized as ecosystem services. Most individual respondents and a large majority of the local political leaders said that the Park should continue to exist. Crop raiding by animals from the Park is a problem in some locations but resource restrictions and expulsion were not widely cited by our respondents. The fact that the large majority of residents migrated to the area after the Park was established may be an important explanatory factor for these responses, and this is also likely to be the case for many other mid altitude tropical forest parks, the demographic and land-use histories of which differ from those around many savannah parks.

Where land use and resource extraction is severely limited, local people turn to resource pools outside parks. Kibale National Park in western Uganda is a remnant of a previously larger, mid-altitude forest region surrounded by dense agricultural settlement. We combine remote sensing techniques and household surveys to examine landscape change and fragmentation and the implications for securing rural livelihoods. Forests and wetlands outside the park provide important resources such as fuelwood, building poles, and water, but they are also problematic for local farmers since crop raids by primates and elephants emanate from these fragments. Our analysis shows that since 1984 forests and wetlands have decreased in size and number and those that remain have become increasingly isolated within the agricultural mosaic. Farmers have adapted to resource shortages and human-wildlife conflict in different ways. Our results suggest that wealth, ethnicity, and distance from the park are important factors in determining responses to these issues.

The critical importance of adopting such an approach is argued in this paper by exploring the challenge of resource over-exploitation in the abalone fishery in South Africa and the loco fishery in Chile, both of which faced unsuccessful fishery closures and the implementation of Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries (TURFs). By exploring similarities and differences in fisheries context and approaches, these case studies highlight that although management strategies have been progressive on paper, they are compromised, to different degrees, by a lack of understanding of the socio-economic and political factors that are influencing the fisheries system. We argue that unless a more integrated approach is adopted to understand the social-ecological system as a whole, few long-term benefits will be secured for both the resources and the livelihoods of fishers.

Based on data gathered in the Katavi Rukwa Lukwati and Ugalla core areas of Western Tanzania, this paper compares and analyses how projects developed their strategy and objectives to address conflicts between local population and conservation agents, and how this led to changes in conservation practices. The projects managed to achieve their objectives in conservation and poverty reduction at various degrees. Enhanced conflict resolution capacity involving private stakeholders, conservation agents and local communities, as well as improved collaboration between projects, helped to solve part of the conflicts. This was the case with the negotiation of rights of access for beekeepers to Rukwa game reserve. However, enduring sector based approaches continue to hinder opportunities for developing multiple use approaches. Contrasted results of the projects can be explained by factors inherent to projects' planning and management, but also by factors that are beyond projects' influence such as the historical and contemporary context in terms of governance of natural resources and more globally, of power relationships between the state, private organisations and the communities.

Appearance of challenges in natural resources management presented by governmental organizations signals a new and more comprehensive approach to natural resources management. This management is the responsibility of the system including all of stakeholders, in particular local farmers. In fact, farmers' participation in natural resources conservational programs (NRCPs) can be a context for making important and active decisions relating to environmental conservation. This study has attempted to response to the question toward which factors affecting farmers' participation in NRCPs. The data collected for this study were derived through a stratified random sampling procedure from 308 farmers in Qazvin province, Iran. The multiple regression analysis revealed that factors such as age, family size, distance from Governmental Natural Resources Centers, environmental attitude, and need to extension programs relating to natural resources conservation influence directly on farmers' participation, while factors such as conservational knowledge and behavior influence indirectly on farmers' participation in NRCPs. The paper concludes that factors affecting farmers' participation present information that can be suitable for success of environmental decision making.","journal":"Journal of Food, Agriculture and Environment","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This paper examines the sustainability of a PES silvopastoral programme in Colombia from peasant farmers' perspectives. Programme participants were asked questions regarding their perceived ability to continue with the silvopastoral practices, the influence of the economic benefits and contracts on behavioural change, and the programme's impacts on self-determination, innovation and social learning; factors considered critical for sustained resource management. While the participants expressed a need for the PES programme practices, less than half stated that they would continue with the silvopastoral measures and only 13% understood that part of their contractual commitment was to conserve forests. Ten per cent of the participants considered themselves the principal decision-maker in the farm-level changes and only one participant had altered the prescribed practices, despite a common perception that some techniques were not suitable for the region. The results suggest a need to re-examine the degree to which the PES model in fact encourages adaptive management practices and sustained land-use behaviours in peasant communities.

To learn more about local cultural adaptation to policy changes, we interviewed 37 households in Deqin County on their traditional knowledge, and the changes they have observed in ecological conditions, livestock health, and land management. These villages varied in proximity to main roads, farmland quality, and livelihood options. Herd sizes in Deqin have quadrupled since the 1950s, due to commune era policies and subsequent privatization of livestock. The practice of burning shrubs increased during the communal period but has since decreased due to a burn ban. Herders report that the increase in shrublands invading alpine meadows has reduced livestock forage, reducing the productivity of alpine rangelands and yak health. Butter production has declined by 30 % over the last two decades. Herders are shifting to diversify sources of income when available, but villagers in remote and protected areas continue to depend on livestock for much of their livelihood. Scientific data confirm herder reported ecological changes including increased temperature, decreased snowfall, and accounts of increased erosion (which deserves further study). Climate, policy, and economic incentives have interacted to increase pressure on shrinking alpine meadows and reduce dairy production.

Lion killing is shaped by Maasai perception of livestock depredation, socio-economic factors, and the complex relationship between Maasai and conservation. These all affect tolerance for lions and consequently Maasai behavior towards conservation initiatives and carnivores in general. We used an in-depth quantitative questionnaire and participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) to identify the social and ecological predictors of lion killing and to investigate the effect of a compensation scheme on individual tolerance. Individuals who lose a greater proportion of their livestock to predators relative to their overall livestock loss, those affiliated with an evangelical church, and those who mainly sell rather than accumulate livestock all reported a higher propensity to kill carnivores. The future of carnivore conservation in this region depends on a better understanding of the nuances of human-carnivore conflict and a concerted effort to address appropriate cultural and community-level institutions, chiefly by providing economic benefits to local people who engage in positive conservation activities.

Allowing pastoralists access to PAs and their resources remains a contentious issue in southern Kenya, where retaliatory killing of African lions (Panthera leo) by Maasai pastoralists has caused a steep decline in the lion population, threatening local extinction. Previous studies that have shown that local people often have negative attitudes toward PAs; here PA policy during times of hardship is linked to attitudes toward lions and behavioural intentions. Different access policies to grazing inside Tsavo and Nairobi National Parks during the 2008/2009 drought influenced Maasai attitudes toward lions and their propensity to kill them. A semi-structured questionnaire (n = 206) and a multivariate model examine the relative importance of PA access and 11 additional predictors on individuals' attitudes and reported inclination to kill lions. Access for livestock to PAs, benefits from wildlife and higher education were associated with positive attitudes toward lions and a lower reported propensity to kill. The success of lion conservation in Maasailand may depend upon recognizing and accommodating pastoralists' inherent vulnerability to drought-induced livestock mortality.

This approach was adopted to increase the likelihood that technologies developed would be suitable for resource-poor households. It is expected that integrating indigenous and scientific knowledge, will lead to positive ecological and economic outcomes.

The perception and attitudes of local communities who inhabited the frontiers between human activities and wild elephant movement are important to the mitigation of the HEC and conservation of wild elephants. To analyze the perception and attitudes of local communities, the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was used in the investigation of 423 interviewees from 22 villages in Xishuangbanna from July 2009 to February 2010. The results indicated that local communities had their views on the elephant-related problems. In field survey, we found that 66.5% of interviewees were willing to support, participate in, and assist in the conservation of wild elephants; 33.5% of interviewees were opposed or indifferent to such conservation, because their livelihoods and even their lives were endangered by wild elephants. These views and attitudes were influenced by local communities' perception of HEC, education level, gender and self-interest. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the diverse views among local communities and balance profits and costs in addressing HEC.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the household level impacts of a small scale agro-forestry based carbon sequestration project in rural Mozambique.

We used the propensity score matching technique to assess the PES-project impacts on household cash income, consumption expenditure, forest resource use and crop yields. We found that, in contrast to nonparticipant households, PES-participant households earned more cash income, incurred more consumption expenditure, collected less forest products and, harvested lower quantities of agriculture crops. In addition, we found, through decomposition analysis, that there was a differential in PES income. Both male-headed and high-income households were being favoured as project benefit recipients. Future PES-projects should focus on a payment scheme that can better ensure the benefit to all the participant households and also pay extra attention on the benefits distribution to the vulnerable households.

Understanding the resource-use patterns of such communities provides a basis for seeking the participation of such communities in forest conservation. The present study undertaken in the Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary and the adjoining Sigur Plateau in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, addressed the importance of forests in the household economy of indigenous communities. Its main objective was to quantify the forest dependence of local people, and assess to what extent restrictive biodiversity conservation strategies would affect their livelihoods. These questions help in understanding the stake of the people in forest conservation strategies. Economic activities of the households were investigated in eight selected villages, four of which (proximal villages) had access to reserve forest areas where collection of forest products was allowed and were also located close to markets that provided opportunities to sell forest products. The remaining four villages (distal villages) were close to the Wildlife Sanctuary where the collection of forest products was not allowed and there was no access to organized markets. A total of 132 households were surveyed. The households both in proximal and distal villages were classified into three distinct income groups namely 'low', 'medium' and 'high', based on their gross annual income. Use of forest resources in Mudumalai was found to be influenced by multiple factors. In terms of livelihood of the traditional communities livestock rearing and collection of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) were very important, the latter both for cash income and subsistence use. Peripheral communities used the forest resources in a varied fashion, with NWFPs contributing differently to different income groups. Where there was no restriction on forest use, higher income groups used the resources more heavily than lower income groups, and hence would suffer most from any restriction on forest use. People's reliance on forests evidently declined with increased level both of education and of opportunities in nonforestry vocations. Forests were still very important to the household economy of the local people both in terms of food security and cash income.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Here, we develop detailed demographic and socio-economic profiles of residents around Kaziranga to study conservation attitudes and awareness using a semi-structured survey of 590 households in 37 villages. Results show high variation in attitudes and awareness as a function of ethno-religious group, educational level, and socio-economic and immigration status, indicating more and different needs for economic interventions within some communities than others. We found a high degree of conservation awareness, but most people expressed negative conservation attitudes and almost all lost crops to wildlife. We highlight the complexity of conflict in the area and present a basis for electing a microsite planning approach for conservation and development in areas characterized by high ethnic diversity, high human population densities, and land-dependent large mammals that pose economic risks. The findings imply that highly localized development schemes and participatory approaches to resource management at the village level, coupled with greater efforts at education, are especially needed to achieve conservation and development goals in such cases.

The Richtersveld National Park (South Africa) is unusual in that it forms part of the Richtersveld communal rangeland and is currently managed for goat and sheep farming as well as biodiversity conservation under a contractual agreement. These two objectives are not regarded as mutually compatible and have created tension between conservation management officials and pastoralists. We set out to examine the consequences of reducing herd size in a communal livestock production system in support of biodiversity conservation in a protected area. Kidding, animal offtake (sales and slaughter), mortality and herd persistence showed no clear incentives for an individual pastoralist to reduce herd size. Reducing herd size is not considered a recommended intervention for the conservation of biodiversity or livelihood improvement of pastoralists in the park. The future of the natural resources of the national park is dependent on a delicate balance between the needs of the pastoralists and the conservation of those very same resources that the pastoralists use.

In applying this participatory planning process to eight conservation landscapes in Africa we have begun to document and learn about the benefits and limitations of planning and implementation at the landscape-scale with stakeholders. We draw out lessons on the challenges and successes from our experience. Central to this are the merits of balancing a systematic science-based and pragmatic approach to landscape-scale conservation planning while addressing the needs and aspirations of local people.

This paper explores how tension between global and local interests arises. It investigates differences in the acquisition of knowledge about the forest ecosystem and suggests ways to mediate and negotiate between the interested parties. Catchment forest management at Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania is the reference case for this research. Methodologically, there are challenges connected to the different positions expressed in a 'locals - globals' discussion about forest ecosystem services and sustainability. Within this setting, the paper argues for an ecological mediation between locals and globals based on an actor-network and stakeholder approach. In the conclusion, the paper suggests a framework for ecological methods, where ecological semantics can be a mediator between nature (ecology) and culture (society) to evolve a common understanding for environmental sustainability and valuation of ecosystem services. From this, another framework for mediating ecological indicators is developed to keep the elements of local versus global interest, nature versus society and epistemology versus ontology together in one system.

The paper then presents the concepts of traditional ecological knowledge and traditional management systems and practise to provide background for two case studies that examine traditional knowledge and forest management practices of tribal communities in the Sariska region (Rajasthan, India) and of the indigenous Mapuche Pewenhce communities in the Andean mountains of southern Patagonia in Chile, underlining the special relationship these tribal and indigenous communities maintain with the forest and their usefulness in community-based native forest conservation. These examples of traditional ecological knowledge and traditional management systems suggest that it is important to focus on managing ecological processes, instead of products, and to use integrated ecosystem management. Recommendations to move forest management paradigms beyond the current view of 'timber' or 'reserves' and toward one of truly integrated use that adapt conservation approaches to local cultural representations of the environment are made.

From opposing the establishment of the park, to seeing the park as a provider of services, to finally feeling a sense of ownership of the park and its rare cranes, local attitudes toward the park have changed dramatically. This article contributes to literature on integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) on many fronts. Unlike economic conflicts ICDPs have addressed elsewhere, the conflicts around Muraviovka Park have been ideological. The project is also in Russia, a region of few ICDPs that merits examination. Additionally, this is a long-term study that demonstrates that time is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of an ICDP.

This study examines the income from NTFPs and the dependency on these of different socio-economic groups in Northern Benin. Using survey data from 230 households of two villages, we firstly compared incomes of five different ethnic groups being differentiated by their traditional source of livelihood and regional provenance. Secondly, we investigated disparities between three income groups. On average, income from NTFPs accounted for 39% of total household income and had a strong equalizing effect on it. However, the economic relevance of NTFPs differs between households: Poorer households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs in order to fulfill basic needs than wealthier households. However, the latter extract more NTFPs in quantitative terms and have significantly higher cash returns than poorer ones. This is mainly due to a significant greater land holding. Moreover, our study revealed that net income from NTFPs reflects traditional sources of livelihoods of different ethnic groups. In conclusion, both conservation and development strategies should take into consideration the socio-economic context of different beneficiaries of savanna woodland resources in order to apply appropriate measures to poverty reduction.

As a result, management of marine commons is inherently biased towards short-term interests of industrial fleets, rather than the long-term maintenance of coastal ecosystem health. Artisanal fishers' knowledge can provide practical information for management, and when shared, can help build trust between fishers and managers. However, until recently, very few studies designed to support fisheries management have incorporated fishers' knowledge. This study was designed to characterize the geography of fishing in the Gulf of Honduras (GOH), shared by Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras, from the perspective of artisanal fishers. Data were compiled from semi-formal interviews with key informants, community meetings, mapping exercises, workshops with fishers in the GOH during 1998-1999, and participant observations through July 2011. Data were used to document fishery landings, status and trends in marine resources, the spatial and the temporal dynamic geography of fishing, and fishers' suggestions for improved conservation and management. Many of these suggestions have been implemented in the GOH between 1999 and 2011. This study offers a practical methodology that can be used in other artisanal, data-sparse fishing areas to document the geography of fishing, increase the participation of fishers in management, and lead to better participatory, ecosystem-based management.

D.; Stronza, A.","year":2011,"title":"South-South exchanges enhance resource management and biodiversity conservation at various scales","dAbstract":"International conservation organisations have invested considerable resources in fostering biodiversity conservation programs in the humid tropics, the most biologically diverse areas on earth. Recent approaches to conservation have centered on integrated conservation and development projects and participatory resource management programs, co-managed between governments and local communities. But these programs have had only mixed success and often suffer from insufficient quantity or quality of participation by local communities. We pose that participatory resource management is more likely to succeed when community members, 1) gain a global perspective on how their social, economic and environmental conditions compare with peer communities in other similar areas of the world, and thus better understand issues of relative scarcity and the benefits of sustainable resource management, and 2) engage as decision-makers at every stage of the conservation process up to reflective program evaluation. This paper examines the role of South-South exchanges as a tool to achieve these intermediate goals that ultimately foster more effective and participatory conservation and support sustainable local livelihoods. The data are extracted from the initiatives of the authors in two different environments - marine and coastal communities in Central America and the Caribbean, and lowland rainforest communities in the western Amazon of South America. We conclude that the exchanges are effective ways to build stakeholder comprehension about, and meaningful engagement in, resource management. South-South exchanges may also help build multi-local coalitions from various remote areas that together support biodiversity conservation at regional and global scales.","journal":"Conservation and Society","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

These values can help inform the management of ecosystems such as coral reefs. However, the trade-offs in ecosystem goods and services associated with different social and management conditions are poorly understood. Consequently, we examined values assigned to the goods and services identified across three types of management on the Kenyan coast: (1) a government-imposed no-take area in the Mombasa Marine National Park; (2) co-management of gear between fishing communities and the government's fisheries department; and (3) community-initiated no-take area management, where a community independently initiated and controlled a small closed area. We compared the ecosystem goods and services and the broader total economic value to explore how the history of these sites, their social conditions, and different management choices were associated with these values. The highest total economic values were associated with government management interventions and were probably due to the government's priority to be involved in the high-value beach tourism destinations. This is, however, associated with losses in a range of local community-level values and the social capital of the resource-user community. For example, resource users near the government marine protected area had the lowest value for measures of biological knowledge. Sites displaying greater community-level values were characterized by high social capital, and users had the most confidence in their ability to manage the resource. This study suggests that trade-offs occur in values associated with the interests and responsibilities of the management. The ability to cope with disturbance and change will depend on these values and responsibilities, and local communities are less likely to respond when government management and interests are strong.

S.","year":2008,"title":"Priorities for fisheries in marine protected area design and management: Implications for artisanal-type fisheries as found in southern Europe","dAbstract":"Much has been written in recent years regarding the advantages of marine protected areas (MPAs) as conservation tools. The benefits to fisheries have commonly been cited as primary motives in favour of the establishment of MPAs. To date, a good deal has been theorised with regard to the benefit of MPAs to fisheries in their adjacent areas, but there has been little empirical evidence to support or refute hypothetical claims. Considerations for fisheries' benefits are different to those of ecological benefits in several respects. Economically, fishers' livelihoods often depend on the marine reserve being successful. It is not enough to establish that populations of fish are growing due to protection; stocks, as well as individual fish have to be sufficiently large to be catchable by the industry. Furthermore, restrictions in fishable area ought to be compensated for by increases in catches over time. In terms of the biology of the fish themselves, evidence has shown that heavily exploited commercial fish stocks can take much longer to recover from over-exploitation than previously expected. Although there have been several studies that consider the effects of export and spill-over, there have been few that focus on the patterns that these phenomena might have on the surrounding fisheries; many assume that ecological patterns will manifest in the fishery with time. Recently, assessment methods and predictive models have been suggested for fisheries (e.g. Rapfish, Ecopath/Ecosim), some of which have been adapted specifically for MPAs. In this paper we review recent progress in the field of MPA research with particular focus on fisheries assessment. We also identify priorities, and knowledge gaps, for determining and accurately predicting the benefits of MPAs to fishers.

The newspaper carried a story on the Olive Ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea); it explained that although globally endangered, the turtle was still a regular visitor to the village's local beach. When some of the young people in the village realized that the turtle nesting sites were so special and in need of protection they formed a small committee and started to learn about the turtle's lifestyle and, as a consequence, the benefits of the coastal ecosystem as a whole. Today an 8km seashore community-conserved area stretches along the common land of the village. Conservation activities are focused on the turtle nesting season and mangrove restoration. Although no scientific studies have been carried out in the area, local people report many positive benefits from their efforts. Ecologically these include increased fish-catch and better quality drinking water in the restored mangrove areas, as well as higher numbers of nesting turtles and better hatching success on the beach. Socially, the benefits range from the empowerment of young people to better relationships and interactions with the local forestry department. Culturally, the traditional activities carried out in the village were dying out due to declining fish-take and people's aspirations going beyond the lifestyle offered in a small fishing community (Kutty, 2009). Although the links between species protection and the wider defence of human cultural values can appear to be tenuous, and are rarely investigated by researchers from a traditional scientific background, they can be critical in gaining acceptance for both conservation activities and the ideas of protected areas. The activities in Iringal, which link the protection of species and ecosystem services with the development of strong community action, governance and empowerment, are leading to the kind of social cohesion needed to ensure both ecological and cultural survival.","journal":"","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Responding to this question would be a tall order for anyone, not least in an underfunded protected area with a primary goal of biodiversity conservation. Yet the park authorities must respond and manage the resources of the protected area with the well-being of the local population in mind. And this is perfectly possible.

The answers to those questions can and do affect the policy decisions of agencies, which in turn affect the economic situations of people who make a livelihood from harvesting the ocean's resources and the ability of a host of marine creatures to survive. The answers to those questions often differ depending upon whether you are viewing them as a scientist, a policymaker or a court.

Data were collected by questionnaire and informal interviews with 59 men and 57 women living on the southern edge of the Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda, to assess the influence of these factors in attitudes towards elephants, in an area from which they are now absent, and to conservation in general. It was hypothesized that prior experience of elephants might influence people's perceptions of them, and that this in turn might influence their attitudes towards the issue of elephant conservation. The results of this study did not generally support this. There was no evidence that people with prior experience of elephants were any more likely to support their conservation than were people who did not have prior experience of them. Within this community men and women expressed very different views as to the behaviour of elephants. Women were more likely than men to report that elephants were dangerous, irrespective of whether they had seen an elephant or not. Locally, conservation was considered to be particularly important and beneficial as a strategy because it 'should help ensure protection of people and their crops from marauding elephants and other animals'. Attitudes to, and expectations of, conservation as a strategy also varied between members of this community with respect to gender, but age and ethnic group were not good predictors of whether people were likely to be supportive of conservation issues or not.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

It begins by defining the social and political ramifications of the current environmental conservation debate in Africa, and how these are crucially affected by rural people's perceptions of environmental goods. Next, the paper explores the exploitative colonial legacy of wildlife conservation in Zimbabwe, and how that legacy has or has not been transformed since independence. The paper pays close attention to the development of linkages between rural farmers, local conservation NGOs, and local and national governmental bodies. Finally, the paper finds that, while many positive linkages have been made between conservation authorities and rural farmers and ranchers in elephant conservation programs, few such linkages have been made in the various rhino conservation schemes. Since Zimbabwe has been relatively successful in conserving its elephant population, but relatively unsuccessful in stopping rhino poaching, the paper concludes that the development of positive linkages between rural farmers and the state, which include heavy doses of popular participation at the grassroots level, is crucial for any successful natural resource policy.

However, there is little evidence that alternative occupations reduce fisher numbers. Seaweed farming is frequently promoted as a lucrative alternative occupation for artisanal fishers in Southeast Asia. We examined how the introduction of seaweed farming has affected village-level changes in the number of fishers on Danajon Bank, central Philippines, where unsustainable fishing has led to declining fishery yields. To determine how fisher numbers had changed since seaweed farming started, we interviewed the heads of household from 300 households in 10 villages to examine their perceptions of how fisher numbers had changed in their village and the reasons they associated with these changes. We then asked key informants (people with detailed knowledge of village members) to estimate fisher numbers in these villages before seaweed farming began and at the time of the survey. We compared the results of how fisher numbers had changed in each village with the wealth, education, seaweed farm sizes, and other attributes of households in these villages, which we collected through interviews, and with village-level factors such as distance to markets. We also asked people why they either continued to engage in or ceased fishing. In four villages, respondents thought seaweed farming and low fish catches had reduced fisher numbers, at least temporarily. In one of these villages, there was a recent return to fishing due to declines in the price of seaweed and increased theft of seaweed. In another four villages, fisher numbers increased as human population increased, despite the widespread uptake of seaweed farming. Seaweed farming failed for technical reasons in two other villages. Our results suggest seaweed farming has reduced fisher numbers in some villages, a result that may be correlated with socioeconomic status, but the heterogeneity of outcomes is consistent with suggestions that alternative occupations are not a substitute for more direct forms of resource management.

The use of high resolution fishing effort data in environmental studies has allowed significant scientific progress with respect to the environmental impacts of real fishing fleets and provided a more realistic perspective on the wider ecological consequences of fishing disturbance. A new EU council regulation and its interpretation, aimed at protecting the confidentiality rights of individual fishers, are currently hampering scientific access to this high-resolution effort data and thus are endangering the provision of management advice based on best available knowledge. This study argues that the withholding of this information will seriously undermine the quality and accuracy of scientific output and ultimately damage fishers' livelihoods through poorly advised management. Furthermore, the council regulation runs contrary to the EU's initiative for greater transparency and its commitment to implement an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the preservation of ecosystem services. The interpretation of the new EU council regulation by local administrations can thus only be viewed as a significant step back from these aims. Ultimately, while trying to protect fishers' rights it may work to their disadvantage and that of society.

A focus on trade-offs can open the way to more complete consideration of the variety of positive and negative effects associated with conservation initiatives. In analyzing and working through conservation trade-offs, however, it is important to embrace the complexities inherent in the social context of conservation. In particular, it is important to recognize that the consequences of conservation activities are experienced, perceived, and understood differently from different perspectives, and that these perspectives are embedded in social systems and preexisting power relations. We illustrate the role of trade-offs in conservation and the complexities involved in understanding them with recent debates surrounding REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation), a global conservation policy designed to create incentives to reduce tropical deforestation. Often portrayed in terms of the multiple benefits it may provide: poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and climate-change mitigation; REDD may involve substantial trade-offs. The gains of REDD may be associated with a reduction in incentives for industrialized countries to decrease carbon emissions; relocation of deforestation to places unaffected by REDD; increased inequality in places where people who make their livelihood from forests have insecure land tenure; loss of biological and cultural diversity that does not directly align with REDD measurement schemes; and erosion of community-based means of protecting forests. We believe it is important to acknowledge the potential trade-offs involved in conservation initiatives such as REDD and to examine these trade-offs in an open and integrative way that includes a variety of tools, methods, and points of view.

Despite extensive PA coverage in many countries on the Continent, biodiversity is declining throughout Europe. According to international scientific studies, PA management schemes often fail because benefits for local people are not realised, and their participation is neglected. However, despite the development of integrated PA concepts such as biosphere reserves and nature parks, instances of PA failure are regularly reported, suggesting factors other than the mere selection of integrated concepts. In order to identify such factors, a qualitative meta-analysis of 20 case studies from 10 European countries was conducted. It was generally found that though providing benefits for and involving local people are important success factors, the prevailing socio-economic and political conditions have the potential to prevent management success. While this parallels other studies that caution to view certain paradigms of area protection as a panacea and call for closer attention to the existing conditions, another important factor was identified: the perceptions and attitudes of the local people and of PA managers. They may affect PA management success through restricting opportunities and support for adequate benefits and participation processes. Therefore, it is essential to gain knowledge on both the conditions and the perceptions and attitudes. Here, socio-ecological monitoring appears to be an important means of gaining this kind of knowledge and evaluating it. This will eventually engender adaptive learning processes that accommodate the complexity of social-ecological systems and their biocultural diversity. Â© 2010 The Authors.

The paper has transverse application to similar large energy projects in third word countries where construction might impact sensitive ecosystems. The Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) was developed in line with international standards and also to empathise with the objectives of the draft Yemeni biodiversity strategy and action plan. In addition, the company carried out biodiversity baseline survey, environmental and social impact assessment studies which translated into two World Bank compliant environmental and social management plans (ESMP) for the construction and operation phase of the project. The BAP describes the biodiversity status of Balhaf and the surrounding coastal area, setting targets for ecological conservation and outlining the mechanisms for achieving these targets, in addition to developing dynamic indicators, which will help to identify any beneficial effects. The BAP also contributes to the conservation of Yemeni biodiversity beyond the affected area. Furthermore, it deals with biodiversity and related socioeconomic aspects which will be implemented during construction, and longer term protection of biodiversity during the operation phase, in addition to promoting scientific development research and capacity building. Following pre-construction surveys, the little known coastline was discovered to be rich in very sensitive and diverse corals which play an important habitat role, contributing to the local artisanal fisheries, and a prime resource in this impoverished region. Nevertheless, Yemen lacks any specific legislation relating to biodiversity preservation, which would mandate significant new projects to develop a specific biodiversity management strategy. However, due to the ecological sensitivity of the site, Yemen LNG decided to voluntarily put in place a biodiversity action plan which is directed towards the conservation and sustainable development of biodiversity and the economic livelihood of local fisheries.

M.; Tarp, P.","year":2005,"title":"Rapid stakeholder and conflict assessment for natural resource management using cognitive mapping: The case of Damdoi Forest Enterprise, Vietnam","dAbstract":"Understanding stakeholders' perceptions and motivations is of significant importance in relation to conservation and protected area projects. The importance of stakeholder analysis is widely recognized as a necessary means for gaining insight into the complex systemic interactions between natural processes, management policies, and local people depending on the resource. Today, community and group-based participatory inquiry approaches are widely used for this purpose. Recently, participatory approaches have been critiqued for not considering power relations and conflict internal to the community. In this article, we suggest that the five-step Rapid Stakeholder and Conflict Assessment (RSCA) methodology addresses this critique. The objective of the methodology is to provide a facilitator with a comprehensive foundation on which to plan and conduct subsequent participatory project development. The RSCA integrates elements of soft systems and critical systems thinking. Qualitative research interviews and cognitive mapping of stakeholders' mental models are used for collection of empirical material and analysis. The RSCA methodology is demonstrated in a case study concerning buffer zone management in the coastal wetlands of southern Vietnam. The case study shows that the RSCA methodology can provide an efficient way of obtaining a holistic and critical understanding of a complex resource management situation, thus potentially enhancing project performance in an instrumental as well as an ethical sense.

These factors relate to formal institutions, socio-economic conditions and social capital. The study reveals different barriers to effective governance at different levels. Socio-economic conditions affect the participation of local communities, whereas formal institutional arrangements are major barriers to the collaboration between state-actors across sectors. Mutual trust, communication and reciprocity may nurture and foster participation and collaboration by actors in the multilevel governance of MPAs. The article stresses the importance of social capital in multilevel governance of human-natural systems. It concludes that the existing institutional structure of MPAs may require reforms to achieve more effective governance and to meet the overall goals of the national MPA network.","journal":"Journal of Political Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Analysis and findings","dAbstract":"Integration of farmers' knowledge and perception with researchers' knowledge is important for planning resource-conserving technologies. In many places in the world, farmer participation has been shown to be essential in the planning of sustainable land management. The findings of a participatory approach (PA) for integrated conservation planning in the Danangou catchment - a small catchment situated in the heart of Loess Plateau - are presented in this paper. The work was carried out by an interdisciplinary team during the period 1997-2000. The PA is an interactive learning process between local farmers and researchers. The process was facilitated by several visualisation and diagramming methods. This formed part of an integrated conservation planning approach, where three tools including PA, land evaluation and soil erosion modelling were combined within the entire conservation planning process. The Danangou catchment is characterised by its distribution of cropping systems on all degrees of slope to meet the food needs of the villagers. Farmers' criteria on land suitability, including slope aspect and soil workability, were evaluated. Farmers approved several biological and physical conservative measures, which provided one of the important bases for formulating different land use scenarios (LU scenarios). The factors influencing farmers in choosing different LU scenarios were analysed, including (1) current household economy in relation to production from the land; and (2) prediction of changes in the household economy due to different LU scenarios. The farmers' vision on implementation of the LU scenarios, i.e. gradually converting cropping land, conforms well with the plans of the local government. However, due to the poor living standard and lack of off-farm employment, any effort to improve land use towards more sustainable practices seemed to be difficult to implement without support from the government in terms of food, seedlings and also sources of employment for the villagers. The strategy for conversion work in connection with the central government policy on re-greening the Loess Plateau must focus first on areas where off-farm activities are available or potentially available. A diversity of conservation alternatives was found to meet the needs of different farmers' groups. It is recommended that alternatives be developed by an active collaboration between farmers, extensionists and researchers.

Conflict between elephants and agriculturalists is already widespread and can lead to displacement or elimination of elephants, causing a further decline in their range and numbers. 'Protectionist' conservation groups have recently attempted to play down the importance of human-elephant conflict, contending that it has been greatly exaggerated by those advocating sustainable use of wildlife. The future of elephants in ecosystems over much of the continent will depend largely upon the attitudes and activities of humans. The realities of survival faced by rural Africans may mean that little attention will be paid to a debate taking place on conservation philosophy in the developed world. Therefore, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) is investigating how human land use can be integrated with the needs of elephant populations in Africa's biogeographical regions. Findings from these studies will be used in attempts to benefit elephant conservation and management in the 37 African elephant range states.","journal":"Oryx","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Its Bedouin Support Programme component is designed to provide tangible benefits to the Protectorate's inhabitants as a means of building their support for, and participation in, the project's conservation initiatives. This paper discusses the process by which the objectives and work plan of the Bedouin Support Programme were established. A gender-balanced nine-person field team, composed of mainland Egyptian and expatriate social scientists and a local Bedouin, conducted extensive discussions with representatives of all tribal groups living within the Protectorate. Bedouins called for assistance in the creation of jobs and income-generating activities, improvement of water supplies, reversal of trends in environmental deterioration, involvement with tourism, and access to health and educational services. They made numerous suggestions for conservation-related activities in which they could participate, including wildlife protection and remote park facility operations. The team then consulted companies and government agencies which would be impacted by, or involved in, the Protectorate's Bedouin-related activities. Using these Bedouin and non-Bedouin perspectives, the team then developed a work plan for Bedouin Support Programme activities, seeking to further Bedouin interests in the areas of natural resource conservation, employment and income generation, the operation of remote park facilities, tourism, training, animal and human health, agriculture, and infrastructure.","journal":"Mountain Research and Development","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Overpopulation and large-scale overfishing are among the most severe threats. The Kuna have developed their own management strategies to address these pressing issues. This study presents local perceptions and attitudes towards marine resource management of six indigenous fishing communities in Kuna Yala, Panama. Results highlight significant general and comparative differences in fishermen's attitudes and perceptions based on socio-cultural structures of communities, occupation and role in local decision-making. The level of cultural survival in communities was a strong indicator for different priorities and attitudes. Differences were also evident based on the level of marine resources used for income generation. Participation in local decision-making processes had positive impacts on levels of knowledge and information, and fostered critical thinking among participants. In addition, the results also denoted that conservation and development were more effective in the long term if the host population could develop strategies and plans for biodiversity conservation. Ownership and empowerment were strong indicators that influenced local livelihood to promote sustainable use of marine resources.

Created in 1939 by presidential decree with the primary objective of protecting native keÃ±ua (Polylepis tarapacana) forests, the Sajama National Park, later ratified by national law, had neither formal administration nor park rangers until 1995. Towering over the barren lands of the Altiplano - Bolivias highland plateau, at an altitude of about 4000 m - Mount Sajama plays a key role in traditional indigenous mythology, as well as in the formation of the present-day identity of local communities. The latter factor is largely due to a new policy and to multiple activities launched by the Bolivian national parks authority (Servicio Nacional de Ãreas Protegidas, SERNAP) during the past decade.

The analysis was based on primary socioeconomic data from 240 households combined with farmer management surveys and biophysical plantation data. Management practices were determined to be grossly inadequate, with chronic overharvesting and an uncontrolled pest problem leading to poor yields. Given that bamboo shoots provided the main cash income source, this had a major impact on household income and livelihoods. Changes to culm management and pest control practices are recommended which could significantly increase shoot productivity and income, while improving bamboo's contribution to rural livelihoods and its role in targeted poverty alleviation. Improving smallholder bamboo management practices is, however, constrained by a general lack of relevant research and management guidelines based on scientifically proven techniques to optimize productivity.

This study of Five Blues Lake National Park in central Belize explored attitudes towards ecotourism and conservation of local people living adjacent to and co-managing a national park. The authors conducted attitudinal surveys of residents of Saint Margarets village in 1995 and in 2003. The data suggested high levels of support for ecotourism development and continued protection of the land and conservation efforts. Despite this support, by 2003, most ecotourism activities and park management had been curtailed. Although the inception of co-managed ecotourism was received well and some level of interest existed, over time, there was a decline in community participation and ecotourism activities. This is attributable to factors including resident apathy, low community participation, diminished financial resources, insufficient local and national management capacity, and perceptions of few personal benefits by residents. Furthermore, the often claimed theoretical benefits of ecotourism in developing communities were not fully realised in this case. As demonstrated by this study, local involvement of residents in development and implementation of ecotourism initiatives, including necessary capacity-building, may help ensure sustainable management and success of long-term ecotourism and conservation efforts.

Specifically, interest in degazetting KNP was examined (as a reflection of attitude towards the Park) relative to type and extent of KNP outreach, wildlife-related problems, household wealth and residency status. Reported attitudes were then related to fuelwood extraction patterns. Attitudinal surveys showed that a lack of KNP outreach (i.e. village-level services and visits by KNP staff) and increased land wealth and shorter residency time were associated with increased interest in seeing KNP degazetted. However, after controlling for ethnicity only recognition of village-level Park services was still associated with positive attitudes towards KNP. People recognizing KNP services also demonstrated more ecologically sustainable wood extraction methods. These results suggest that while attitudinal studies seem to be a logical step towards making informed decisions about the effectiveness of protected area outreach, relating such outreach to behavioural changes in resource use through attitudinal assessment is a greater challenge, requiring a clear understanding of the relative influence of socioeconomic and cultural factors.

Interest in accessing the protected wood resources was not associated with fuetwood needs, and did not fall along ethnic or demographic lines. Instead, logistic regression analysis identified material and land wealth as variables that increase households' interest in accessing wood resources in the Park, whereas intent to move in the near future and the interaction of material and land wealth were negative influences. These results suggest that resource-use interests are largely dependent upon expected individual gains, which vary according to household needs and ability to process resources for potential local sale or trade. This study considers the importance of distinguishing between people's conservation attitudes and their interest(s) in using specific resources, emphasizing the need to recognize intra-community variation in use interests.

Through the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse (SKAD) the production of REDD+ discourse in four REDD+ programmes is explored by means of 14 documents. The programme texts are regarded as influential discursive practices performed by the programme hosts who draw on existing discourses and institutional-organisational infrastructures, while simultaneously producing subjects, objects and activities with different rights, responsibilities and values. The results demonstrate a process of discursive ordering of knowledge, forest use and forest dependence where the programme hosts form a common understanding of the interrelationships between climate mitigation, adaptation, poverty reduction, and tropical deforestation. As a consequence, the programmes bias action towards transformation of forest sectors as a step towards greening economies in tropical forested developing countries. The analysis demonstrates how the programme hosts produces a narrative where they themselves become key agents facilitating change, while forest dependent local communities are classified as subjects of necessary change. The focus on local dependent communities in effect obscures more distant causes that are not associated with local livelihoods. This narrative resembles the 1980s narrative on tropical deforestation, where farmers and slash and burn practices were considered the main cause of deforestation.

Alternative views suggest that savanna ecosystems vary with a large number of biophysical factors, among which human impacts may be of relatively minor importance. This paper examines the debate with respect to Mkomazi Game Reserve in Northern Tanzania, where biodiversity has been inventoried and local resource use studied. It sets out the history of land use in Mkomazi and examines the available data on the area's plant, bird and invertebrate diversity. Comparative analysis is complicated by the paucity of data for other savannas in the same biogeographic zone, and by differences in sampling effort and methodology. Conservation literature and Tanzanian government documents present Mkomazi as one of the richest savannas in Africa, as a centre of endemism, and as threatened by deleterious impacts of human land use. Available data do not substantiate such statements. The paper examines implications of those perceptions for management, particularly eviction of resident pastoralists from the Reserve in 1988, and subsequent exclusion of reserve-adjacent dwellers. Conservation relies increasingly on reserve-adjacent people, and on prioritizing the allocation of scarce resources. There is an urgent need for rigorous studies of the implications of human land use in savannas, for better data on biodiversity, and for rigorous standards in the way those data are applied.","journal":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Consequently, the foreign military used bombs, cannonfire and toxic chemicals (herbicides and defoliants in high concentrations) to destroy the forests. The principal herbicides that were used include \"agent orange\" as well as white agent (mainly to destroy forest trees) and blue agent - chemicals that kill the forests. Of the total mangrove area in southern Viet Nam of 291 000 ha, 105 000 ha or 36 percent were sprayed one or more times. A large part of timber and other resources in mangrove areas were lost. Forest soil was chemically changed because of the loss of protective vegetation cover, with lower pH from insufficient fresh-water in the dry season and higher salinity because of increased evaporation. Without the protection that mangroves offer against tides, waves and water currents, severe coastal and riverbank erosion occured. For a few years after the defoliant spraying, fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic resources increased in number as decomposed leaves from fallen mangroves created abundant food in water. However, they later decreased rapidly when no mangroves remained. After mangroves were destroyed by herbicides, some species such as crocodiles and tigers became extinct. Monkeys, lizards and birds, which used to be found in great numbers in mangroves, also decreased gradually after the war. Added to the direct effects of mangroves loss were the indirect impacts on the livelihoods of people who depended on the wildlife and other forest resources. Between 1978 and 1999, some 21 400 of the original 40 000 ha of mangroves were rehabilitated in Can Gio, a district of Ho Chi Minh City in southern Viet Nam.","journal":"Unasylva","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Whilst bio-physical evaluations have widely reported on the hydrological, ecological and conservation components of the programme, there exists growing uncertainty over the programme's role as a poverty reduction mechanism. This paper evaluates three projects in the Luvuvhu catchment, Limpopo Province, against five socio-economic workfare criteria and the underlying biophysical rationale. Results show that asset creation from incremental streamflow is economically efficient and is likely to improve significantly if biodiversity benefits, community harvesting of riparian goods and services, ecological non-use values and seasonal water demand values are incorporated into the analysis. However, socio-economic benefits are more questionable: poverty targeting is weak with wage rates failing to self-select the poor; a minor proportion (0.5%) of catchment households benefit from the highly-valued employment opportunities; high variability in monthly employment causes financial difficulties for labourers; labourers are not 'empowered' as is evidenced by the failure of the 2-year exit strategy; and programme efficiency is high in proportional allocation of cash-flow to non-management wage labour. It is concluded that the Working for Programme is a potentially replicable model in other semi-arid contexts in developing countries if based on its core biophysical remit but is a transitory and limited poverty reduction mechanism for improving rural livelihoods.

On the one hand, extensive development of water resources led to the transformation of millions of hectares of virgin lands into agricultural production, providing millions of people with food and livelihoods. On the other hand, the over-exploitation of water resources led to drastic changes of the environment: many water bodies, such as lakes, small rivers, and delta wetlands dried up. The Aral Sea basin is one of the dramatic examples of the negative impacts of large-scale irrigation interventions. The state-controlled era of development in the Soviet period has a legacy of standardized procedures and rules formulated at the top. The shortcomings of such a water management included fragmentation, duplication, and a highly administrative approach without considering the needs of the environment and input of water users into planning, allocating, and managing of water resources. This paper presents an analytical view of the role and importance of water users organizations/associations (WUOs/WUAs) in the irrigated agriculture and under irrigation management transfer (IMT) in Central Asia region. International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the Scientific Information Center of Interstate Coordination Water Commission (SIC ICWC) conducted the \"Best Practices.\" Projects including activities covered Syr Darya and Amu Darya basins of Central Asia.

Focus groups, semi-structured interviews and household surveys were conducted to document current and historical patterns of aguaje harvest and management, the importance of aguaje to household income, and to identify current harvesting strategies and key perceptions regarding management. This was complemented with ecological sampling in 12 aguaje stands to determine population abundance, population structure, and sex ratio. Results indicated that M. flexuosa stands show clear evidence of past over-exploitation, with a current sex ratio of 3.48 males for each female, and low adult female densities (21females/ha). Despite this, M. flexuosa remains highly abundant and populations maintain an inverted J-curve structure; however, results also showed a significant relationship between low densities of adult females and low densities of seedlings (R 2=0.476; p=0.013), suggesting that the felling of females from the canopy is reducing recruitment rates. The current state of M. flexuosa populations corroborates the harvest history as told by interviewees that intensive destructive harvesting began in the 1990s and has since waned, primarily due to the decline in the stock of females and low prices. Attempts at non-destructive harvesting, via the use of climbing harnesses has had mixed success as nearly half of the M. flexuosa palms harvested in 2010 were cut down rather than climbed. Scarcity of adult females and low prices resulted in low return on effort, and current income from aguaje accounts for just 5% of the communities' cash income. Results indicated that four factors synergistically interact to hinder development of sustainable aguaje management: (1) low resource stock, (2) market barriers, including poor market access and low prices, (3) limited access to climbing technology and training, and (4) limited organizational experience at a community level, which limits the effectiveness of attempts to mitigate the first three barriers. Despite these challenges, the Maijuna and aguaje have many attributes associated with successful management of natural resources. Our study suggests that in cases where forest resources have already been degraded, transitioning to more sustainable management alternatives can be difficult as a number of ecological and socio-economic factors interact to hinder implementation.

Kanak villagers viewed \"conservation\" largely as a means of reinforcing their cultural identity through preservation of their cultural heritage, grounded in the landscape. However, at the same time, they hoped to promote economic development. Ironically, thus, they found it necessary to welcome outside influences-to seek visits from non-Kanak tourists and to request financial and technical support from the provincial government, which had been created by the colonial power. Meanwhile, although a desire to reinforce customary authority structures formed an important part of this search for a unifying cultural identity, the quest for a stable, traditional, shared \"past\" created new, micropolitical instabilities within the community, conditioned by expectations of financial gain and by sources of social status. A \"micropolitical ecology\" approach revealed that a conservation program grounded in customary authority would be the only acceptable solution, although it would be difficult for villagers to agree on who filled customary roles. This study indicates the importance of gaining a clear understanding of intra-community dynamics and of community members' perceptions of external groups, in order to design appropriate strategies for co-management.

The current population density of about 850 per square kilometer is the highest of any nation in the world and it s economy is heavily dependent on agricultural productions. During the decade between 1984-85 and 1994-95, share of agriculture to GDP declined from 41.8 to 32.8 per cent. Projection of employment to the year 2020 shows that till that time agriculture will continue as the major source of employment by absorbing over 40% of the labor force (World Bank and the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies, 1998). The total annual flow of the river system in Bangladesh is about 1.5 billion cubic meters of which 1.36 billion cubic meters (93%) originates from upper regions in India, Nepal and Bhutan. During the monsoon season (June to October), there is plenty of water (85% of the total flows) and opposite happens in the dry season (November to May) when the flow of the rivers go down so much that in certain areas of the country normal economic life is seriously disrupted. The south western region of Bangladesh which is solely dependent on the Ganges waters for its sustenance has been facing major environmental hazards since the operation of the Farakka barrage in 1975 in the upstream of the river in India. The above water syndrome, too much during the wet months and too little during the dry months, points to the necessity of better management of available water resource. The ongoing National Water Management Plan (NWPM) will make an assessment of the overall availability of water both spatially and temporarily and will project the balanced use of these resources. The Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) is playing a vital role in this context which led to the signing of the historic Water Treaty with India in 1996. The treaty on sharing the flows of the Ganges water with India has started bringing in relief to the drought prone area of the Southwest of Bangladesh. In 1995-96, a total of 3.57 million hectares of land were irrigated in Bangladesh, in which 3.40 million hectares were covered by private sector dominated minor irrigation and the rest was covered by public sector operated major irrigation schemes. The economics of irrigation indicates that Low Lift Pumps (LLPs) is the most cost effective of all minor irrigation technologies in the country. For LLPs used by farmers, profits were found to be extremely high - internal rate of return (IRR) of 64%, STWs come next in terms of rate of return (IRR of 61%). Deep Tube Wells (DTWs) are found to be economically nonviable. In recent years ground water contamination with arsenic have posed a threat to these resources. Fisheries, navigation and wild life are integral parts of economic development in Bangladesh and strongly linked to incomes of target groups, poverty alleviation, nutrition and employment generation. Availability of water for fisheries and navigation is thus important from the point of view of sustenance of these groups. The paper deals with an integrated management approach of all these issues.

The government's open access and leasing policies have been identified as the principal causes of catch decline. Conflicting demands on the inland aquatic area also accelerate drastically the destruction of aquatic resources. Barriers to the access of fishers in the management of inland fisheries resources and over-exploitation by the relatively wealthier non-fisher population are reducing the options for sustaining the livelihoods of fishery dependent communities. The government has pursued a range of initiatives to arrest this continued decline but none has appeared to be appropriate. In this study we investigated the present fisheries management crisis of Bangladesh and justified the opportunities for existing fisheries management to evolve towards community based fisheries management (CBFM) to support the sustainable use of fisheries resources in future.

Mestizos are people of mixed Indian and European descent who speak Spanish and do not consider themselves to be Indians. BosawÃ¡s is one of the last refuges of the Mayangna indigenous group and is also the largest area of protected tropical rainforest in Central America. The Mayangna village of Sikilta, in the North Atlantic Autonomous Region, is used to illustrate the nature of land conflicts in the region. Such conflicts - between economic development and conservation, between livelihoods and conservation, and between peasant livelihoods and indigenous territorial rights - are symptomatic of rainforest areas in other parts of the world. Land conflicts in BosawÃ¡s are examined within the broader economic, political and institutional context. Potential solutions to land conflict in Sikilta are explored. The paper illustrates the complexities surrounding the demarcation and upholding of indigenous land rights. It highlights the institutional complexities and weaknesses which have allowed Sikilta's land problem to go unresolved. It is argued that until national problems of unequal access to land and unsustainable forms of forest use are addressed, communities like Sikilta will continue to suffer invasion of their land.

Conservation of the critically endangered saiga antelope in the Republic of Kalmykia (Russia) provides a unique experimental set-up that was used to disentangle this issue. This study uses the amount pledged for conservation, adapted from contingent valuation methods, as a measure of behavioural intention to contribute to saiga conservation, to evaluate conservation effectiveness. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 250 individuals in eight villages exposed to traditional 'fences-and-fines' conservation, livelihoods enhancement (social engagement) or low-level media coverage. The intervention employed had a direct effect on amount pledged for saiga conservation. Social engagement programmes decreased protest-bidding behaviour but resulted in low amounts pledged for saiga conservation. Those exposed to media coverage pledged the greatest amounts on average, whilst those exposed to traditional conservation had both a high level of protest bidding and low pledges from those who pledged something. The primary reason given for protest bids was that the government or international community should pay for conservation. This may be a relic from the Soviet era, and may explain low pledges for conservation under social engagement. Ecological knowledge strongly affected amount pledged. The results were influenced by cultural and demographic factors, including residence time, exposure to saigas, age, wealth and knowledge regarding conservation. This study is unusual in disentangling the effect of a conservation intervention from other factors, and proposes using amount pledged for conservation as a practical tool for evaluating the effectiveness of projects aimed at increasing awareness and promoting positive behavioural intentions towards conservation. It provides support for media awareness-raising as a successful conservation intervention.

We carried out 250 semi-structured interviews in eight villages. The effectiveness of the campaign was assessed using change in opinion over the previous 3 years as an attitudinal indicator and amount pledged for saiga conservation as a measure of behavioural intention. The campaign induced positive changes in attitudes and behavioural intention. Reinforcement was important, with people's retention of information about saiga conservation from the campaign being positively correlated with their level of ecological knowledge about the species. Similarly, behavioural intention towards the saiga was more likely to be positive in individuals who had a high level of exposure to the species and/or had been subject to two or more different conservation interventions. Level of attitudinal change was dependent on an interaction between the date when the media campaign was carried out and the age of the respondent. We conclude that public awareness campaigns, if designed to take into account the socio-demographics and cultural background of the target audience, can be an effective method of improving attitudes towards conservation.

LWW trains, equips, supports and links mission teams to share clean water with needy communities with over 320 clean water systems in 24 countries around the world. LWW serves communities that have available but contaminated water and has developed modular clean water systems (CWS) to address the needs of each community. LWW projects contribute to the UN Millennium Development Goal \"Halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water...\" LWW CWS utilize standard treatment technologies: filtration, micro-filtration, and disinfection and can process up to 1100 liters (290) gallons per hour. LWW has found that multiple batches each day will support the critical water needs of up to 2000 people. The Standard CWS receives raw water from either ground or surface water. Raw water passes through a 50 micron sediment filter and is pumped through a 5 micron then a 0.5 micron micro-filter. This water is disinfected with Ultra-violet (UV) light or by ozone injection. The Standard System hardware and equipment costs are about $3,000. Operating costs can be as low as $0.005 per gallon based on local electricity rates and other factors, not including labor. The Clean Water Systems Handbook is LWW's comprehensive training manual. Block Flow Diagrams and Decision Trees help partners determine the best CWS for their needs. The most complex system includes activated-carbon filtration, water softening, and reverse osmosis. Clean Water U is LWW's five-day, hands-on training program. Each of the three separate courses emphasizes the \"train-the-trainer\" approach in an experiential training environment. These courses include: CWU 101: Team Leadership, Partnership Development, Field Survey and Water Testing, CWU 102: Health and Hygiene Education, and CWU 103: Water System Installation, Operation and Maintenance. Covenants between an Initiating Partner and the Operating Partner establish a three-year commitment to make four trips to the site of the Operating Partner. The first is for site survey and partnership development activity where Partners negotiate the covenant that covers all equipment issues, costs, and who will be responsible. Operating partners can operate their system as a micro-business, selling water for up to 50% of the commercial rate for bottled water. However, water must always be provided for those unable to pay. The second trip is the education and installation trip where the system is installed and the community is trained in health and hygiene education. The third and fourth trips are annual follow-up visits to monitor the progress of the project. When a covenant expires, the partners can renew it, become embedded in a network or operate independently. Regional Networks help make these CWS more sustainable. LWW has eight Networks established in the Yucatan (Mexico), Guatemala, Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, and in Appalachia in the US. Each network is organized by a US volunteer-based Coordinating Team with some paid support staff in some countries.

In 2006-2007 a project was initiated, with farmer participation, to investigate the efficacy of on-farm techniques to reduce crop-raiding, including guarding and early-warning techniques, fences, plant barriers, trenches, lights and nets. Here, farmers' perceptions of the effectiveness and sustainability of these deterrents were evaluated using semi-structured interviews and direct observations. Factors important to farmers in effective, sustainable and locally appropriate crop-raiding mitigation are that deterrents be cost-effective, easily manipulated, improve guarding efficiency and require minimal labour inputs. Farmers reported paid guards, guard dogs, wire fences, lights and bells/alarms as most effective. This differs from observations that farmers independently maintained certain deterrents that they presumably considered valuable, namely wire fences, guard dogs, bells/alarms, trenches, lights and nets. This evaluation demonstrates the importance of farmers' participation and perceptions in the viability and uptake of crop-raiding deterrents, and the importance of assessing conflict mitigation trials over the long term.

Ecotourism management has become an economic issue for tourism industry in conservation and development projects. The traditional approaches of biodiversity conservation concerning areas or national parks protection have been considered ineffective and unethical due to the externally imposed rules and regulations on local people. The establishment of national parks and other forms of protected areas in Taiwan in the past has regarded human activities in such areas as incompatible to the goals of natural resource conservation. Conflicts between the authority of national park and indigenous people were reported during the establishment of national parks in Taiwan, which resulted in the relocation and imposition of constraints on indigenous people. The development and implementation of ecotourism and integrated conservation development projects have been advocated throughout the study to gain local support. The aim of this study is to propose an approach for the issue of indigenous communities and local government ecotourism management based on the framework of Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD), a methodology which has been successfully adopted in analyzing human's attitudes and intention. In particular, this paper addresses the issue of how to deploy the house of quality (HoQ) effectively and efficiently toward key dimensions of ecotourism and tourism guideline of the authority. Fuzzy logic is also adopted to deal with the ill-defined nature of the local residents' attitude preference required in the proposed HoQ. The case of Kinmen national park is presented to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed FQFD in ecotourism development. The effective and appropriate management directions for ecotourism development acquired by applying the proposed FQFD, thus, enables the national park authority to achieve an environmental, social, and politico-economic conditions.","journal":"","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The attitudes and perceptions of farmers towards Grain-for-Green are little known, but will eventually dictate the direction and, ultimately, the success of the project. This paper interprets surveys concerning attitudes towards environmental protection, in general, and the Grain-for-Green programme, in particular, in two small catchments in the Loess hilly area. Participatory Rural Assessment techniques are used as survey instruments and logistic regression analysis is used to analyze farmers' attitudes towards environmental conservation and Grain-for-Green. Most respondents are positive about environmental protection and Grain-for-Green in general. However, marked differences are evident between the two small catchments: the level of farmers' environmental protection consciousness in Anjiapo catchment is higher than that in Danangou catchment. Respondents in Anjiapo catchment expressed more support for the programme than respondents in Danangou catchment. Environmental care by farmers may not be sustainable should the programme come to an end. The results provide a useful insight into the interests and concerns of farmers, which might lead to a more positive attitude in officials in the future.","journal":"International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This research reports the first population-based survey on Taiwanese public knowledge, attitudes, and actions on marine-related issues. The stratified random sampling by county was completed with 1,120 telephone respondents from October to December 2010. More than 60% of the respondents have heard about global warming, sea-level rising, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the coral reef bleaching crisis, and Japan whaling fisheries. However, less than 20% of the respondents are aware of Taiwanese domestic marine policies, such as the Ocean White Paper. On resources conservation, 74.7% of the respondents support the bluefin tuna catches regulations and 76.6% agree that the shark fin fisheries will impact shark resources. Education and age are the major affecting variables for resource conservation and knowledge. Higher education and age 40-49 are most supportive of conservation measures. For marine recreational activities, 42.2% of the respondents can swim, and 44.2% of the respondents had not visited the beach in the previous year. The results suggest that the government could establish a specialized agency to strengthen its marine policy and take more actions to protect ocean environment and conserve marine resources. To encourage more Taiwanese to participate in ocean recreational activities, the government could build a safe facility for marine recreation, cooperate with the private sectors in education, and provide outreach to raise public awareness of the oceans.

The Shaxi Valley in Yunnan Province, P. R. China, is inhabited by Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups. We found a clear dichotomy between household strategies in the valley bottom and the mountain areas, with significantly lower household income in the mountains. The majority Bai people live predominantly in the fertile valley floor and cultivate rice, keep livestock, and commonly pursue off-farm work. Other ethnic groups live in more remote mountainous areas of the Shaxi Valley, where the collection of non-wood forest products, especially wild mushrooms, plays an important role in securing livelihoods. However, only households in the valley's central villages engage in the profitable non-wood forest product trade. Mushroom populations appear to be less vulnerable to commercial harvest than the rapidly declining wild medicinal plant populations. Due to this decline, local farmers have gained interest in cultivating medicinal plants, but only if risks are low and if financial and technical support is provided.

If divorce from nature is bad for health, restoring that relationship may be therapeutic. It may be possible to identify the curative or prophylactic elements of the environment, thereby creating a powerful lever for their conservation, perhaps with wider benefits for biodiversity conservation. This virtuous circle encompasses two key topics, which the authors present as hypotheses: first, that engagement with nature delivers health benefits (the ecosystem service hypothesis) and second, that these benefits are sufficient to lever directly the conservation of health-giving aspects of the environment, perhaps bundled together, as an indirect benefit, with co-benefits to wider biodiversity (the conservation leverage hypothesis).

We developed a national-level vulnerability index that is specific to food security policies by measuring nations' relative vulnerabilities to a decline in their coral reef fisheries. Coral reef fisheries are expected to decline with climate and anthropogenic disturbances, which may have significant consequences for food security. The vulnerability measure was composed of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity indicators specific to fisheries, reef management, and food security. The vulnerability index was used to evaluate 27 countries, as data required to fully populate the theoretical framework was limited. Of these, Indonesia and Liberia were identified as most and Malaysia and Sri Lanka as least vulnerable nations. Our analysis revealed two common national vulnerability characterizations: low income countries with low adaptive capacity and middle-income countries with higher adaptive capacity but high sensitivity. These results suggest developing context-specific policies and actions to build adaptive capacity in the low-income countries, and to decrease sensitivity in middle-income countries. Comparing our food security evaluation to a more general vulnerability approach shows that they produce different priority countries and associated policies.

Coastal artisanal fishing communities are particularly reliant on marine resources for food and for their livelihoods. Management actions aimed at marine conservation may lead to unanticipated changes in human behavior that influence the ability of conservation programs to achieve their goals. We examine how marine conservation strategies may impact labor decisions that influence both the ecosystem and human livelihoods using simulation modeling. We consider two conservation strategies in the model: direct action through fisheries regulation enforcement, and indirect action through land conservation. Our results indicate that both strategies can increase the abundance of fish, and thus contribute to the maintenance of marine resources. However, our results also show that marine fisheries enforcement may negatively impact the livelihoods of human communities. Land conservation, on the other hand, potentially enhances the livelihood of the human populations. Thus, depending on management objectives, indirect or a combination of direct and indirect conservation strategies may be effective at achieving conservation and sustainability goals. These results highlight the importance of accounting for changes in human behavior resulting from management actions in conservation and management.

However, certification has proved more difficult for CFEs than expected, and few certified operations have achieved the highly anticipated market benefits of certification. This has led to questioning of the compatibility of certification with CFEs, though few studies have directly asked local CFE actors their perceptions on this issue. This study investigates perceptions of certification for two CFEs in Brazil's western Amazon. The specific objectives of this study were (1) to determine the positive and negative aspects of certification as perceived by community members, their principal support organizations, and other key stakeholders, (2) to identify the relative importance of these perceived positive and negative aspects, and (3) to analyze the differences in perceptions between actors. Data were collected through structured interviews and a review of pertinent documents. Overall, the most positive aspects were economic and social, and the most negative aspects concerned the certification process and, to a lesser extent, the associated economic expenditures. Community members typically scored the positive aspects higher and the negative aspects lower than the support organizations. This is likely due to differences in roles and vantage points of these actors. In general, informants agreed that positive aspects of certification outweighed negative ones. This stands in contrast to some communities in other parts of Latin America that are contemplating dropping certification. Two particular conditions may have enabled operations in this study to overcome common constraints for CFEs: (1) membership in a regional producers group, and (2) strong political, technical, and financial support from the state government. Their experiences specifically highlight the need to adapt the certification process for CFEs and demonstrate that obtaining market benefits is possible. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we bring local perceptions to the fore in comparing the ideal and the real in ecotourism. Using ethnographic observations and interviews, we describe how local residents near an ecotourism lodge along the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua first perceive and assess the ideals and sustainability of ecotourism in locally-grounded, realistic ways, often taking into account the broader social, economic, and environmental context of Nicaragua. Though people tend to be highly critical of the operation, they also acknowledge many relative merits of the ecotourism project's work. We then focus on narratives related to the ethical performance of this project. Here, people were less generous in their remarks and found little about the ecotourism project to support. This analysis demonstrates how failing to capture critical local evaluations of ethical aspects of project performance allows greenwashing abuses to persist unchecked and, thereby, nullifies those elements which distinguish ecotourism from other forms of tourism. Future research and certification efforts must make a greater effort to assess local perceptions of ethical performance.","journal":"Human Organization","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

These actions constitute critical links between social and ecological systems that result in outcomes that feedback and influence recreational fishers' actions and the management of these actions. Although much research exists on recreational fishers and their actions, this research is often disconnected from management issues. One way to help to overcome this disconnect is to illustrate how past research on the social component of recreational fishing fits within an emerging coupled social-ecological system (SES) framework. Herein, a conceptual SES is first developed with specific attention to recreational fisheries. This SES is then used to illustrate the importance of considering human dimensions research for articulating, studying and ultimately managing key outcomes of recreational fisheries (e.g. fish population conservation, fisher well-being) using the example of harvest regulations and a brief review of past interdisciplinary research on recreational fishing. The article ends by identifying key research needs including understanding: how factors such as management rules affect the diversity of actions by recreational fishers; how governance and management approaches adapt to changing social and resource conditions; and how recreational fishers learn and share information.

This involves devolution of the rights to manage and control access to the resource from the state to the resource appropriators. Co-management has been introduced in many Third World countries with varying success. Co-management programmes have typically assumed that the resource community wants to conserve the resource and is prevented from doing so by their inability to form a collective choice arena. Hence such programmes have attempted to provide a collective choice arena. However, these attempts overlook the need to change the attitudes of resource users and create a demand for the resource regime. In this paper we have presented two case studies of joint Forest Management in India to illustrate this point.

They play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of the coastal environment, acting as sources of nutrients to adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems through active and passive transport. We examined the nutrient contents in mangrove and nonmangrove soils in and around the Bhitarkanika National Park, India and assessed whether the local agricultural producers were aware of and placed a value on this contribution of mangrove forests in enhancing agroecosystem productivity. Soil samples from both mangrove and nonmangrove areas were analysed and quantity of organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium were derived. The replacement cost method was used to derive the value of nutrients in mangrove soils. We estimated that each hectare of mangrove contains additional nutrients worth US$232.49 in comparison to nonmangrove areas. The difference in nutrient content in mangrove versus nonmangrove areas gave the value of US$3.37 million for the nutrients in 145 km2 of mangrove forests. The agricultural producers were aware that mangrove forests act as a source of nutrients and were willing to pay a higher price for the land adjoining mangrove forests. Around 92% of the producers ranked nutrient retention as a secondary function of mangrove forests. Despite crop depredation from wild ungulates and conflict with salt water crocodiles the agriculturist finds the benefit to cost ratio of mangrove forests high and more than 76% were in favour of mangrove restoration. This study provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of mangrove ecosystems to the livelihoods of the local people and the urgent need to sustain these through proper policy and market interventions.

This paper quantifies the value of provisioning services of mangrove forests to local livelihoods in terms of forestry and fishery products. To examine the use of mangrove products, 324 households from 36 villages in the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area located in East Coast of India were surveyed using structured questionnaires. For estimating the contribution of mangrove forests to fish productivity, fish production was evaluated in three stages-inshore fishery, offshore fishery and the role of mangrove forests as nursery ground for fish and shellfish. The findings revealed that 14.2% of the fuel need of each household was being met by the forests. Other forestry products used were timber, honey and thatch grass. During the study, 14 species of fish and three of shellfish were recorded. The total catch for inshore fishery was estimated as 3.77 kg h-1 having market price of US$ 2.25. In offshore fishery the number of species caught as well as income from the catch was higher in areas with mangroves (US$ 44.61 h-1) than in those without mangroves (US$ 2.62 h-1). The market price of the forestry and fishery products used by the people was estimated as US$ 107 household-1 annum-1. The resources extracted from mangrove forests contributed to more than 14.5% of the total income of the household. This was around 30% for the households residing in the immediate vicinity of the forests. This study suggests that provisioning services provided by the mangrove forests are of significant importance to the coastal communities as they increase the resilience and sustainability of the local economy.

This study analyzes the gap between the original intent of the program and its actual implementation by local officials in Phou Xang He protected area, and discusses policy issues that need to be addressed. It appears that several types of non-compliance with regulations by local people have occurred, with local officials tacitly ignoring infractions. By switching viewpoints, however, it appears that the local officials permit these infractions as a way of allowing local people to secure their livelihoods. As constraints on the realities of land and forest use vary widely in and around villages in different locales, there is a need for government to allow local officials flexibility in implementing policies.

As collaboration between local people and forestry officials is seen as indispensable to effective and sustainable local forest management, the objective of this study is to clarify the issues pertinent to the resolution of latent conflict between these two stakeholders. The issues are examined by presenting two case studies in terms of forest management as perceived by local people and forestry officials; the first in a rich forest area and the second in a degraded forest. Issues relating to land and borders and social capital are identified as the most important in the degraded forest area, while social capital is a very important issue in the rich forest area. Our studies show that the problems of land and border issues in the degraded forest area were caused by an inappropriate resettlement policy. This can be interpreted as the mismanagement of social capital, and for effective local forest management it is very important to overcome problems of this nature. The effective use of social capital has so far been overlooked, however, in the establishment of collaborative forest governance at the local level.","journal":"International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This statute has the role of protecting the priceless natural heritage of the Delta and of mitigating anthropogenic pressure upon it. Moreover, Delta has experienced an increasing aggression by opening the Sulina arm for shipping, especially after 1950. There were two stages that have left their mark on the touristic potential: the first between 1955 and 1970, when the exploitation of reed damaged natural ecosystems and second, between 1975 and 1990, when about 100,000 hectares were drained and converted into agricultural land. This limited economic vision was suddenly replaced by another vision, focused on reconstruction and a drastically limitation of human intervention. Our research relied on the study of archives in the villages, on the field study trips, on some published data of the Institute of Danube Delta and Tulcea County's Council, and on surveys on the settlements and tourists. Starting from the need of future existence of human communities (about 14,000 inhabitants), adapted to a restrictive living environment, and the need to increase the living standard of inhabitants, some points of view that contradict the ways to ensure the protection of the deltaic environment are presented. Tourism can be an alternative for a complex development of the Danube Delta, with some conditions: subsidization of specific local economic activities, for reducing the dependency of inhabitants on fishing, establishing local museums in every commune, presenting the aggression of anthropogenic actions on the natural environment, limitation of unorganized tourism, development of an appropriate infrastructure for transportation in all seasons, respecting the full protection areas, changing reserve's employees attitude towards citizens and vice versa, handing to each tourist a guide of behavior into the Delta. New policies regarding the tourism development in Danube Delta should be based on a rethinking of all current tourist attractions and finding specific ways to discourage aggressive tourism (hunting, large groups, noisy and polluting means of transportation) and to encourage rehabilitation, cultural and research tourism. Important sections of proposed policies regard the tourism as a component process of the deltaic ecosystem and as a tool through which human settlements can become nature conservation guarantees.

The community has set aside VCAs covering 4 300 ha of its 5 928 ha of communal lands and forests, and has received over S769 245 in PES for protection of 2 822 ha of watersheds roughly overlapping the VCAs. Community members attribute decreased maize and other subsistence crop yields, reduction of area available for agriculture, and shortened fallow cycles to the new conservation policies. Meat consumption has decreased after a hunting ban, accompanied by increases in purchasing meat still consumed. By agreeing to conservation measures that restrict their use of ancestral agricultural land and prohibit hunting, villagers have seen local food security become less stable, leading to greater dependency on external food supplies. Continued strict preservation measures under the guise of community conservation could lead to losses of agrobiodiversity, dietary diversity, hunting skills and associated environmental knowledge. Appropriate application of the precautionary principle is essential to avoid structural displacement of local peoples and to ensure the success of community conservation initiatives.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

As such, the Tropical Forest and Climate Change Adaptation (TroFCCA) project of the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) has found in their research that there has been a significant reduction within the distribution and availability of some NWFP species and high variability in their productivity and also led to the vulnerability of the forest-dependent communities. Some valuable NWFP-producing tree species have become extinct but it is not completely linked to climate variability and change as recurrent droughts have also greatly affected the changes in species composition.

In 2002, a participatory management process was designed to restore this forest. Although the project managers and local communities agreed to a plan at the beginning of the process, the plan was not implemented because conflict arose in the course of the process. In this paper, an interactional framing approach was used to analyse the emergence of this conflict, which ended in an impasse. This study showed that the conflict was constructed and evolved mainly in stakeholders' discourses, even without changes in actual forest management and use. Moreover, it became clear that stakeholders constructed different frames in different conversation contexts: stakeholders, who share a set of perceptions, norms, and expectations as constructed and expressed in their talks (we-groups), constructed stereotypes and stigmas, blaming the other party and presenting themselves as innocent victims. In conversations involving all stakeholders, people did not reveal their real thoughts, either about each other or about the proposals for conflict resolution. This study shows the relevance and agency of discourse in conflict, and the importance of the interactional framing approach in understanding participatory management, and conflict dynamics. It reveals how by means of discourses, farmers in the Agoua Forest succeeded in handling the conflict, with the effect that little has been done in the project's decision to implement the plan.","journal":"Conservation and Society","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

As a consequence, the quality of life of a large section of the coastal community is in economic decline. This poses a daunting challenge to the sectoral coastal management programmes, active since the 1960s, aiming at simultaneously ameliorating people's livelihood and supporting the ecosystem. These programmes have been reasonably successful in managing the ecosystem, but in many cases, the situation has become worse. The limitations of these programmes include the tendency to adopt an exclusionist approach, a narrowly departmentalized administration and weak management. Currently, the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) approach is espoused as the main strategy. With the adoption of Bangladesh's Coastal Zone Policy of 2005, the foundation for integrated management was laid. The next realistic target will be to bring about changes in culture and mandate among coastal institutions in favour of integrated management. Â© 2006 The Authors.

Around half of the forests of the country occur in the coastal zone. People extract various goods and services from the mangroves. Nevertheless the mangrove forests are depleting. Although the extent of the Sundarbans forest has not changed much, its decline is of a qualitative nature. Mangrove plantations are increasing in area but they are losing growing stock. To arrest this, Bangladesh has adopted several strategies. The 'Sustainable Ecosystem Management' strategy has now been adopted instead of the 'Sustained Yield Principle'. Biodiversity conservation and enhancement has been taken as a key management goal. A zoning system is being developed for both production and protection purposes. The government facilitates alternative income for the local people by generating activities for the communities which are dependent on the forest. Different non-governmental organizations collaborate with the government in reducing the local people's dependence on the forest. Coastal plantations are erected to protect people from cyclones and to make the land more suitable for habitation. Through this greening of the coastal belt tree plantation is encouraged in coastal villages. Coastal embankments are being planted and leased to poor settlers in exchange for routine maintenance of the embankments. Plantations on newly accreted mud flats help in stabilizing the land, which can later on be settled by victims of erosion elsewhere. These adopted management measures do not only contribute to forestry resource management but also to the social, environmental and economic wellbeing of the coastal communities. These efforts are at present being integrated into an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) project.

However, the success of restoration programs is often focused on biological or ecological criteria. The situation is no exception in Bangladesh, which houses the world's largest mangrove plantations. This study has been undertaken in a south-central estuarine island (Nijhum Dwip) of the Bangladesh coast and aims to understand societal perception on the achievements of a plantation program. Through 110 household interviews and seven group discussions, an assessment was conducted of peoples' perception about major flora and fauna of the mangrove ecosystem, benefits derived from the forest, present condition of the forest, causes of degradation, and ways to improve the situation. Around one-fourth of the respondents mentioned that they were highly dependent on the ecosystem. The most important perceived benefits were: provision of raw materials, prevention against natural disasters, climate regulation and soil retention. However, the majority (>80%) of the respondents perceived the ecosystem to be degrading. Encroachment and illicit felling were identified as the main causes of such degradation. In order to arrest the continued degradation allowed by conventional forest management flaws, adaptive co-management has been recommended to conserve this ecosystem in a more equitable way.

In the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area (KCA), Nepal, livestock depredation by snow leopards impacts on yak herders' livelihoods. Retaliatory killings of snow leopard by the herders have been reported and the concerned authorities recently initiated snow leopard conservation programmes. In 2001, interviews with the yak herders who used the pastures in the Ghunsa valley in the preceding year collected data on the incidence of livestock death caused by snow leopards. The annual net cash income of the yak herders was estimated by obtaining baseline values of sales and expenditure per livestock head through field measurement of dairy products and interviews with a sample of herders. As yet, the average annual damage does not appear to have adversely affected fundamental livelihoods in households with an average herd size (36.6 head). However, in the worst scenario of livestock depredation, households with medium or small-sized herds (<40 head) might risk their living conditions becoming unsustainable or having to withdraw from yak pastoralism. A supplementary interview showed that the majority of the herders, except those who took completely neutral attitudes towards the regional conservation and development programme, had negative views of the snow leopard conservation policy. For the snow leopard conservation programme in the KCA to be a success, there must be a system to compensate the herders' households for livestock damage.

Reducing forest dependency helps in-situ conservation of biodiversity thereby conserving forest resources. This paper presents evidence of income diversification and its effects on forest resource extraction by rural communities living in forest margins. Diversified income sources of typical households include crop farming, off-farm employment, animal husbandry, home gardening and extraction of non-timber forest products and fuelwood. The calculated mean indexes of diversification for the households in forest margins under investigation were 2.53, 2.57, 2.19 and 2.25. Results of the analysis show that the income diversification index had a negative and significant effect on dependency of rural households on forest resource extraction for three forest reserves. A positive relation between the index of income diversification and total income indicates an increase in household income due to increasing diversification income sources. However, given the complex nature of protecting natural forests, income diversification should be part of a broader integrated policy goal to protect natural forests.

The problems stemming from these human actions has compromised the ability of subsequent generations to meet their needs from the earth and in the last few decades, have obliged them to re- structure their educational systems in terms of environmental and sustainability education. Turkey has also introduced a new high school geography program that emphasizes environmental and sustainability education. At present, there is an urgent need to test the relationships between theory and practice to understand whether Turkish schools provide sufficient education on the environment and sustainable development (SD). This study used survey research in an attempt to measure student knowledge levels in environmental and sustainability issues as well as student opinions about the importance, place and future of SD in Turkish high schools. The results suggest that students were relatively knowledgeable about environmental issues, but their knowledge of SD was not satisfactory. The students had significant knowledge gaps concerning certain environmental and sustainability issues. It is quite promising however, that the surveyed students believed that SD was an important concept for their future. Moreover, the students seemed ready to take part in any activity promoting SD.

{"author":"Isaacs, M.; Hara, M.","year":2008,"title":"Transformation in the South African fishing industry and its ability to redistribute fishing rights","dAbstract":"The new democracy, new constitution, bill of rights and a new Fisheries policy created an action space for all previously disadvantaged individuals or blacks(1) to benefit from the redistribution and transformation processes in South Africa. The redistribution of fishing rights to coastal communities forms one of the corner stones of South Africa's new fisheries policy. In the quest to achieve this, the government has tried a number of formulas to increase the number of previously disadvantaged individuals into the fishing sector. Initially from 1994 to 1998, entitlement formed a key strategy. After 1998, with the enactment of new Marine Living Resources Act (MLRA-Republic of South Africa 1998), race and gender were instrumental in how established industry maintained their fishing rights. In 2001 the government tried a social policy through the introduction of subsistence permits to address poverty along the coast. In 2002 a medium term was introduced to create stability with fishing rights. The success of the new entrants depended on the opportunities and constraints and their ability to take advantage of the new space created by the MLRA. This depended on their entrepreneurship skills, ability to raise capital, link to an organization, and access to information. This paper reviews the various formulas the fisheries department (Marine and Coastal Management) embarked on in restructuring and transforming the industry, how communities have attempted to rake advantage of the action space and whether the new dispensation has the potential to contribute towards the socioeconomic upliftment of formerly marginalized coastal communities.","journal":"Book Section","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Trends and discrepancies between the two sets of maps were then analysed and discussed with the villagers in order to establish the local land-use history. The involvement of local groups in the mapping process was instrumental in overcoming long-standing inter-village conflicts, mainly by creating a common knowledge platform on which co-management could be based.

During these four decades, while conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity has become accepted as a necessary condition for sustainable development, local and context-specific performance for integrating conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity remains fragmented and unable to meet globally-set performance targets. The origin and evolution of the UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization) Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme and its World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) is analysed to draw insights that explain and help improve the mismatch between the rates of global evolution of ideas and local evidencebased performance to integrate conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The World Network of Biosphere Reserves of the UNESCO MAB Programme, now comprises 564 sites in 109 countries. This UN asset could serve as a platform for international cooperation and sharing of lessons learned from efforts to integrate conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity with the socio-economic and environmental wellbeing of humans.","journal":"Australasian Journal of Environmental Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

However, only a few of them have been sustained. In a reaction, the Forest Department (FD) of Bangladesh initiated a project in the Madhupur Sal forest area to protect forests and improve the livelihoods of forest-dependent people in a sustainable way. This study analysed the nature and extent of peoples' participation in Madhupur projects, and evaluated the project's impacts on the livelihoods of participating people through empirical data. The result revealed that capacity building of encroachers and forest-dependent families were the basic achievements of this project. Natural assets, social relationships, and the utilization of human capital through alternative livelihood strategies have provided security and improved livelihood assets of participants. All participants were appointed as paid community forest workers, received incentives, and established a good relationship with the FD, which dismissed participants' forest offences and mobilized their participation. Moreover, protection of encroacher intervention in Sal forests and substantial re-vegetation went hand-in-hand in a synergistic way that made the project initially successful, but community empowerment issues will need more attention from the FD to ensure the sustainability of the project.

{"author":"Islam, K.

These forest reforms aim to eliminate the main causes of forest depletion as well as alleviate poverty through the participation of local people, who depend on the forests for their livelihoods. This study explores the impact of PF initiatives on the livelihoods of the local ethnic and non-ethnic populations, drawing empirical data from the participatory forestry programs (PFPs). The findings indicate that the most common feature of PFPs were the contribution of financial capital to the participants, whereas other livelihood capitals faced constraints and difficulties. In addition, inequity issues and social capital differences were created between the ethnic and non-ethnic participants, and a lack of commitment by the local Forest Department resulted in PFPs having limited success in creating sustainable livelihoods for the participants. The overall situation revealed that PFPs alone were not sufficient to conserve and develop the Sal forests or assure people's basic needs. Therefore, a long-term-integrated approach by the Forest Department is necessary to address the diversified needs of low-income forest-dependent people in a more sustainable way.

However, declaring a natural resource to be protected has an immense influence on the livelihoods of many local communities living in and around the protected area. This article explores the role of protected sal forests-namely, the Madhupur National Park (MNP) on the livelihoods of forest-dependent ethnic minorities, drawing empirical data from ethnic households. The results revealed that the MNP has brought changes, most of which have had negative impacts on ethnic livelihoods. Now their livelihoods are not stable, as most do not have substantial sources of securing income. In spite of this, the ethnic communities have experienced severe antagonistic relationships with park managers and faced social inequity; all these factors affect their livelihoods. Therefore, establishment of a legitimate process to constructively work with the local communities is the most feasible and just way to achieve conservation and development.

Several studies have shown that local-community support for National Parks is based mainly on perceptions of benefits and costs against the background of social, cultural, political and economic considerations. This paper examines the experience in the Cross River National Park (CRNP) in southeast Nigeria using data collected through rapid rural appraisal techniques, household questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions and guided interviews. The results show that in spite of a high level of community awareness of the need to conserve the forests of the study area, there is a low level of local support for the CRNP forest conservation initiative. Four main factors are identified as the main influences on the support extended to the project, namely: reality and expectations of socio-economic development, the pace of project implementation, the relationship between park staff and communities, and the historical rights of local people to the forest of the study area. The implications of the findings relate to the long-term sustainability of the CRNP as a protected forest area.","journal":"Environmental Conservation","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The theoretical framework and propositions for analysing tree integration in homestead farms are presented, with reference to southeast Nigeria. The paper argues that, first, at the household level, livelihood strategies constitute the main determinant of the decision to integrate trees in homestead farms. Secondly, induced innovation has a wider and more significant role at the community level than at the household level in encouraging the integration of trees in farms. Thirdly, the sustainability of observed patterns of tree integration is influenced by the interaction of environmental, ecological, political, economic and social factors.

This study examined the influence of NGOs on local people's perceptions of CF management by using a quantitative analysis based on a questionnaire survey. Three different forest user groups (FUGs) supported by the Nepal Swiss Community Forestry Project were selected from the Dolakha and Ramecchap districts: an FUG supported by another FUG acting as an NGO, an FUG supported by an NGO specializing in CF, and an FUG without NGO support. A structured survey examined the perception of CF management based on satisfaction, involvement, and self-reliance in 244 selected households belonging to the three FUGs. Knowledge of CF and personal information was also surveyed and analyzed. The results showed that NGO involvement influences factors such as self-reliance and knowledge of CF. FUG members who were supported by an NGO or an FUG had a significantly higher perception with respect to self-reliance and knowledge than did members without such support. This indicates that experienced FUGs can serve as adequate service providers for the CF formation procedure, in a manner similar to that of NGOs. On the other hand, the limited support from NGOs or FUGs during the formation process seemed insufficient to fulfill the expectations of aid agencies with respect to the enhancement of satisfaction and active participation on the part of FUG members. If aid agencies expect NGOs and FUGs to enhance the satisfaction and participation of members, these intermediary organizations should be assigned to support more CF activities than just the formation procedure. Aid agencies should take responsibility for strengthening the capabilities of NGOs and FUGs, as needed.

Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.

A unique hybrid between these two strategies, the Arabuko-Sokoke Schools and Ecotourism Scheme (ASSETS), provides secondary-school bursaries to encourage stewardship of a biodiverse highly-imperiled Kenyan forest. Household surveys and semi-structured interviews were used to assess the effectiveness of ASSETS by comparing attitudes and perceptions toward the forest among scheme beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. The most commonly identified benefit of the forest was resource extraction (for example fuelwood), followed by ecosystem services (such as source of rain). Those in favour of forest clearing tended not to be ASSETS beneficiaries, were less-educated, and were less likely to mention ecosystem services and tourism as forest benefits. ASSETS appears to shape pro-conservation attitudes among beneficiaries and foster a sense of responsibility toward the forest. Challenges for ASSETS are similar to those faced by many conservation and development projects, namely unsteady funding and the risk that the extremely poor may be overlooked. ASSETS may serve as an effective hybrid between the PES and ICDP approaches, and such educational support provides a promising conservation incentive.

It provided a basis for making planning decisions incorporating specific objectives, such as the reforestation of a region or a change in knowledge and attitudes in program participants. Process evaluation provided a Costa Rican sustainable development program with feedback during its implementation and enabled it to modify and improve its newsletter for local farmers and its ecology classes for school children.

The development of the training course involved a survey of scientists and park managers to ascertain resource management needs, priorities for information to be disseminated, and impacts of tourism on the resource base. Current and potential tour guides were surveyed to identify their information needs, solicit their input in the training program, and to determine their knowledge and skills. Written questionnaires were developed and given to 400 tourists to determine their activities and environmental information needs, and hotel owners were censused to examine the economic feasibility of a local guide program. A pilot training course and guide program involving 12 Tortuguero residents demonstrated that a tour guide program: (1) helped mitigate negative tourism impacts on Tortuguero National Park's natural resources, particularly by regulating tourists on the park's 35-km beach used for nesting by endangered sea turtles; (2) provided environmental education to an important segment of the local community not traditionally reached through school or government development projects; (3) provided environmental information to tourists, thus enhancing their visit; and (4) provided local economic benefits through lucrative part-time employment, thereby allowing local people to participate more fully in the tourism system.

In an environment suffering from biomass and water shortages, erosion and land degradation, fast growing and resilient eucalyptus perform better than most indigenous tree species. Smallholders show a clear preference for eucalyptus poles, which are useful for farm implements and constructing dwellings and fences. In addition, the sale of eucalyptus poles and products has the potential to raise farm incomes, reduce poverty, increase food security and diversify smallholder-farming systems in less-favored areas of Tigray. Despite the potential for eucalyptus to improve rural livelihoods, in 1997 the regional government of Tigray imposed a ban on eucalyptus tree planting on farmlands. The ban was precipitated by concerns about the potential negative environmental externalities associated with eucalyptus, and the desire to reserve farmland for crop production. However, the regional government promotes the planting of eucalyptus in community woodlots, and has recently begun to allow private planting of eucalyptus on community wasteland and steep hillsides. In this paper, we review the ecological debate surrounding the planting of eucalyptus trees. In addition, the economic factors that influence smallholders to invest in tree production are considered. Ex ante benefit - cost analysis based on community and village level survey data from Tigray illustrates that planting eucalyptus yields high rates of return, well above 20% in most circumstances. The effect of variable harvest rates, and the potential costs of decreased crop production when eucalyptus trees are planted on or near farmlands are considered relative to our base case scenario. Based upon the review of the ecological and economic impacts of eucalyptus, we conclude that a policy option favoring the allocation of wastelands for private tree planting offers the greatest opportunity for rural smallholders.

Forests and forest products tend to play an important buffer role during the process of change and uncertainty, where forest and fallows provide food products or income that people can temporarily fall back on. In the upland village of Que in North Central Vietnam, several different drivers are currently changing land use and land cover. The Forest Land Allocation policy, implemented in 1998, is one of the major driving forces, allocating farmers a reduced area of land for shifting cultivation in order to prevent any further deforestation and land degradation. However, the reduction in agricultural land set aside for shifting cultivation has lead to a severe decrease in hill rice production. The land use system is in a transition phase - from a conventional shifting cultivation system to a composite swiddening system. The area under shifting cultivation has been reduced, and the system has been intensified via the introduction of paddy rice cultivation, increased livestock rearing and commercial exploitation of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Yet, the current transformation of the system has resulted in a drastic reduction in overall rice production. Thus, the collection and selling of NTFPs such as bamboo shoots, broom grass and pherynium leaves seem to prevent severe shortage of food since farmers are able to purchase food products with the money generated from the selling of NTFPs.","journal":"Geografisk Tidsskrift","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The demand for an assessment of the current forest management, which generally involves criteria and indicators (C&I) at all levels, from local to national has increased in the last decade. Therefore a case study has been done, applying a combination of a top-down and bottom-up approach with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to identify a set of C&I with different groups of stakeholders in selected sites at the forestry management unit level (. leshoz). Six workshops and a series of discussion meetings were conducted to perform a sound analysis of the preferences of four different stakeholder groups. A final set of C&I that consists of seven criteria and 45 indicators has been identified for evaluating sustainable forest management (SFM) in the walnut-fruit forests. Forest health and vitality was found to be the most important criterion, while the maintenance of forest biodiversity was found to be the least prioritized among other criteria. Furthermore, four different management strategies were developed by foresters, research groups, ecologists and forest administrators in order to overcome the present challenges in forest management. By utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), one particular management strategy (MS II) was identified by all stakeholder groups as being the overall best alternative strategy. It was shown that the consideration of non-timber forest products and other options for income generation can improve the livelihood of the people, increase the productivity of resources as well as conserving the gene pool for maintaining forest biodiversity. The findings of this study highlight the importance of a C&I evaluation and its further policy implications. Moreover, it is discussed how the involvement of local stakeholders in the decision making process and their participation in forest management could be stimulated by the C&I development process in the walnut forests of Kyrgyzstan.

Tracing the evolving relationship between ecotourism and conservation, ecotourism and sustainable tourism, and ecotourism and certification/monitoring schemes as we do in this paper reveals conflicting values and possibly incompatible objectives. Sustainable tourism and ecotourism are rooted in notions of individual/ societal and environmental well-being. Yet, our study indicates significant inequities in ecotourism practice, particularly with respect to cultural aspects such as human ecological relationships. It is argued here that various actions and programmes associated with ecotourism's inception and evolution have institutionalised a modernistic, commodified paradigm: the environment and its inhabitants (human and non-human) are dominated by scientific, industry and other interests that treat these primarily as means to an end, that is, instrumentally. The analysis suggests that ecotourism (and, by extension, ecotourism certification) needs to be re-oriented towards well-being, in other words, a social-cultural paradigm based on participatory democracy and equitable, meaningful relationships with the biophysical world.

Afforestation is a cost-effective approach to assimilate increased ambient CO2, which mitigate the predicted effects of global climate change. It is necessary to create public awareness of multiple benefits and environmental services provided by the forests and thereby encourage people's participation in the conservation, protection, and management of forests. Joint Forest Management (JFM) is an approach for sharing of products, responsibilities, control, and decision-making authority over forest land between Forest Departments and local user groups based on a formal agreement. Carbon credit can be generated through carbon sequestration by plantation like reforestation and afforestation project, and this credit can be distributed to the poor people in and around the forest area through different schemes such as employment generation, education, child welfare, small-scale cottage industries, biogas generation, etc. A major part of the earned amount by the carbon credit can be distributed to the forest neighbors who are directly dependent on forest and forest produce for their livelihood. This will give them a fresh look to the forest protection from the forest degradation or illegal felling. Green belt or afforestation is a statutory condition for any development activities where carbon sequestration has not been considered in the concept of green belt or afforestation. This could be recommended to include and select more effective carbon sequestrated plant species in the design of green belt or afforestation for effective mitigation of environmental pollution along with reducing of regional climatic temperature for the sustainable development of any project.","journal":"","included":false,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":true}

Enormous work has been done on ethnobotany and traditional medicine. Like plants, animal and their products are also possessing medicinal properties that can be exploited for the benefit of human beings. In India, many ethnic communities are dispersed all over the country and these people are still totally depended on local traditional medicinal system for their health care. India is gifted with faunal and floral biodiversity, Mount Abu wildlife sanctuary is also one of them, and thus the aim of this work was to take an ethnozoological field survey among Garasiya people (main tribal group of this area) in the adjoining areas of this sanctuary.Method: In order to document the ethnozoological information about animal and their products prevalent among these people in the adjoining area of Mount Abu wildlife sanctuary, a study was carried out from January, 2008 to April, 2008. Data were collected through semi-structured questionnaire and open interview with 25 (16 male and 9 female) selected Garasiya people. The name of animal and other ethnozoological information were documented. Photographs and discussion were also recorded with the help of camera and voice recorder.Result: A total of 24 animal species were used in 35 different medicinal purposes including asthma, weakness, tuberculosis, cough, paralysis and blister and for other religious purposes. It has been find out that animal used by Garasiya, consist of fourteen mammals, five birds, three reptiles, one arthropods and one amphibian. The meat of Cynopterus sphinx used to relieved fever and cough has the highest FL (96%) although flesh of Sus scrofa and tooth of Elephas maximus have the lowest FL (12%). Some protected species such as Elephas maximus (elephant), Semnopithecus priam (monkey), Cervus unicolor (sambhar) were also mentioned as important medicinal resources. We also found that cough, asthma and other respiratory diseases are the most frequently cited disease, as such, a number of traditional medicine are available for the treatment.Conclusion: The present work indicates that 24 animal species were being used to treat 34 various ailments in the surroundings areas of Mount Abu wildlife sanctuary. The results show that ethnozoological practices are an important alternative medicinal practice for the Garasiya people. This study also indicates the very rich ethnozoological knowledge of these people in relation to traditional medicine. So there is an urgent need to properly document to keep a record of the ethnozoological information. We hope that this information will be useful for further research in the field of ethnozoology, ethnopharmacology and conservation point of view.

Agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry and fisheries continue to drive the rural livelihoods. Thus, building natural resources assets, enhancing productivity and the carrying capacity of natural resources has a major bearing on rural livelihoods. Improving the livelihood security of the large rural population is not anymore the last-mile problem for the country and it has emerged as the 'First Mile' problem for the decision-makers. In pursuit of responding to such fundamental needs, Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme is envisioned as a strategic means for building rural livelihoods under the aegis of National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS). India's EO satellite missions with multiple platforms and sensors are tailored as thematic series for land and water resources management; large scale mapping applications; and weather and climate applications mainly addressing the diverse themes under natural resources and environment management. Using the data from the Indian EO missions, NNRMS has played a major role in the natural resources management. It has been part and parcel of the country's endeavor to sustain the productivity gains in irrigated plains and deltas. The real challenge, however, lies in the rain-fed regions with nearly two-thirds of the country's cultivated land, which lagged far behind due to various historical reasons. It has been equally challenging for EO to deliver products and services, which could be helpful in bringing about rapid and systematic development of these regions to remove mass poverty, reduce regional disparities and increase present and future carrying capacity of the resource base. Some of the notable highlights include how EO inputs are put to use for building the physical and social infrastructure in support of expanding the scope of rural livelihoods, creation of natural assets and preserving their diversity. One of the major lessons has been the recognition to have a paradigm shift towards a livelihoods perspective driven by participatory approaches, requiring the natural resources management programmes to clearly spell out goals and benchmarks in terms of enhanced potential to create livelihoods and income. The learning has also driven EO products and services in India from prescriptive to participatory and 'actionable' in support of building rural livelihoods. The EO applications graduated from mapping to theme integration, followed by the development of decision support tools and finally leading towards developing the products and services where stakeholders have their own voices and ownership. The present paper intends to illustrate how India learnt to innovate such developmental applications in response to the emerging paradigms in a more inclusive and participatory manner.

Landowner attitudes to ecological restoration ofagricultural landscapes","dAbstract":"Private property accounts for much of the planet's arable land, and most of this has been cleared for agricultural production. Agricultural areas retain only fragments of their original vegetation and this has been detrimental to many native plant and animal species. Habitat restoration and revegetation may be able to reconnect and enlarge existing remnant areas in agricultural landscapes and, thereby, enhance native plant and animal communities. However, conservation initiatives will be successful only if landowners actively participate in restoration actions. This study used four hundred postal questionnaires to assess the degree to which landowners in two regions of south-eastern Australia adopt restoration activities, their opinions regarding remnant and revegetated land and their management actions in these areas. One hundred and seventy nine completed questionnaires were received. Three quarters of respondents had undertaken restoration on their property or were planning to revegetate in the future. Landcare members were most likely to have previously revegetated and future revegetation intentions were best predicted by previous restoration activities and a primary income source that was off-farm. Landowners were more likely to manage restored and remnant areas if they perceived threats such as weeds, pest animals and fire risk would be detrimental to their property, than to enhance environmental outcomes. These results indicate that landowners are interested in restoring natural areas, but without greater assistance to restore ground layers and manage perceived threats posed by fire and invasive plants and animals, restoration actions will not have their desired biodiversity benefits.

However, they are complex systems that, from a governance perspective, raise serious challenges with regard to their effectiveness. In this paper, drawing on recent contributions to the so-called \"interactive governance theory,\" we argue that marine and coastal governance is basically a relationship between two systems, a \"governing system\" and a \"system-to-be-governed.\" The former system is social: it is made up of institutions and steering mechanisms. The latter system is partly natural, partly social: it consists of an ecosystem, and the resources that this harbours, as well as a system of users and stakeholders who, among themselves, form political coalitions and institutions. We need to be concerned with the relationship and the interaction between the governing system and the system-to-be governed, which forms a system in its own right. Governance theory argues that both systems and their interactions share similar attributes-they are diverse, complex, dynamic and vulnerable. This raises serious concerns as to their governability. There may be limits to what the governing system can do, limits attributed to one or all three systems. But such limits are themselves issues and concerns for planning and institutional design. In this paper we present, in the form of a governance matrix, the relevant issues and concerns with regard to the governability of MPAs.","journal":"Human Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Increasingly, research initiatives are undertaken to enhance understanding of the perceptions and attitudes of rural stakeholders. The effectiveness of the expanding protected-area system in China is critically constrained by similar considerations of community mentality. This paper provides an empirical assessment of local responses towards conservation efforts based on a case study of the recently established Shimentai Nature Reserve (SNR) situated in Yingde, Guangdong Province, China. Questionnaire surveys, face-to-face interviews, and group discussions were employed to gauge local residents' knowledge, perceptions, and expectations towards the SNR. The study covered seven villages situated in and around the reserve, grouped into far-zone (floodplain) and near-zone (upland) categories, accommodating Hakka (Han) and minority Yao peoples. Many respondents had inadequate knowledge, understanding, and perceptions of the reserve. Although most respondents welcomed the expected park-related dividends, the most affected near-zone villagers anticipated losses due to restriction on traditional resource-extraction activities in the forest. The local expectations were influenced by place of residence, emigration of rural young, and household affluence. The lack of local participation in management and inadequate dissemination of information posed obstacles to effective conservation. The high expectation of accruing benefits from development projects, including tourism, might be misplaced and might not be realized. The present honeymoon period of positive attitudes could end soon if the hopes remain unfulfilled for too long. The need to win sustained local support and provide alternative means of livelihood is emphasized.","journal":"Environmental Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Specifically, the Secretariat marketed (filtered, framed, and reiterated) strategic frames of the biodiversity-climate change interface that reframed biodiversity from a passive victim of climate impacts, to an active player in climate response measures (i.e. adaptation). This reframing is significant in that a major hurdle to selling the benefits of biodiversity conservation to countries with more pressing development concerns has been the perceived limited relevance of conservation to human well-being. In emphasizing biodiversity's role in human adaptation and security, the Secretariat has begun to shape member state discourse surrounding the biodiversity-climate change linkage. Ultimately aimed at enriching our emerging theoretical understanding of the role of international bureaucracies in global governance, this article illuminates: (1) how the Secretariat understands and manages biodiversity-climate linkages; (2) the origins of the Secretariat's understanding and activities surrounding this issue; and (3) how Secretariat participation in overlap management is beginning to influence CBD political processes and outcomes.

Required data were collected through a survey of 178 households using a structured questionnaire and participatory appraisal methods. The findings revealed a majority of local people across income brackets benefited from the employment opportunities generated by ecotourism. However, the condition of the natural and environmental resources that served as a foundation of ecotourism was gradually degrading. Regarding social sustainability, locals had taken opportunities to strengthen their capability to promote ecotourism. However, social vulnerability has resulted from increased land grabbing and investment by outsiders, and encroachment by external cultures into the unique Muslim culture. It suggests ecotourism on Yao Noi Island could be sustainable if appropriate interventions were made to ensure the effective conservation of environmental and natural resources and to protect the landownership of private property by local people.

During the past two decades, however, this decline has reversed in various island countries. Today CBMRM continues to grow, refuting the claim that traditional non-Western attitudes toward nature cannot provide a sound foundation for contemporary natural resource management. Limited entry, marine protected areas, closed areas, closed seasons, and restrictions on damaging or overly efficient fishing methods are some of the methods being used. Factors contributing to the upsurge include a growing perception of scarcity, the restrengthening of traditional village-based authority, and marine tenure by means of legal recognition and government support, better conservation education, and increasingly effective assistance, and advice from regional and national governments and NGOs. Today's CBMRM is thus a form of cooperative management, but one in which the community still makes and acts upon most of the management decisions.","journal":"Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The report combines case studies of 11 CBFGs and a verification workshop. Several factors suggest that the development of CBFGs in the region has been positive, including a high membership; strong commitment; basic operational skills; the growth of local, regional and international markets; and infrastructure improvements. Impediments to CBFG success include inappropriate registration of the organisations, insecure access rights, weak leadership and organisational capacities, limited resources, weak market access and limited entrepreneurial and value adding capacity.

B.","year":2006,"title":"Linking biodiversity, diet and health in policy and practice","dAbstract":"Simplification of human diets associated with increased accessibility of inexpensive agricultural commodities and erosion of agrobiodiversity leads to nutrient deficiencies and excess energy consumption. Non-communicable diseases are growing causes of death and disability worldwide. Successful food systems in transition effectively draw on locally-available foods, food variety and traditional food cultures. In practice this process involves empirical research, public policy, promotion and applied action in support of multi-sectoral, community-based strategies linking rural producers and urban consumers, subsistence and market economies, and traditional and modern food systems. Implementation of the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute's Global Nutrition Strategy in Sub-Saharan Africa offers a useful case study. Relevant policy platforms, in which biodiversity conservation and nutrition are and should be linked, include the Millennium Development Goals, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, Convention on Biological Diversity, Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, Food-Based Dietary Guidelines, Right to Adequate Food and UN Human Rights Commission's Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. The largely unexplored health benefits of cultivated and wild plants include micronutrient intake and functions related to energy density, glycaemic control, oxidative stress and immuno-stimulation. Research on the properties of neglected and underutilized species and local varieties deserves higher priority. In tests of the hypothesis that biodiversity is essential for dietary diversity and health, quantitative indicators of dietary and biological diversity can be combined with nutrition and health outcomes at the population level. That traditional systems once lost are hard to recreate underlines the imperative for timely documentation, compilation and dissemination of eroding knowledge of biodiversity and the use of food culture for promoting positive behaviours.

{"author":"Johnston, C. E.","year":2007,"title":"Developing sustainable behaviors through community-based social marketing","dAbstract":"Environmental professionals, when seeking to effect change in the behavior of individuals, most commonly utilize the \"public education campaign.\" This form of social marketing typically consists of public information messages, brochures, posters, or other passive material aimed at raising the awareness of individuals around a given issue. The limitation of such an approach is that it necessarily treats the behavior of individuals as a product, thereby undermining the very goal it seeks to accomplish-namely, reminding individuals that they must take an active role in protecting their environment. In using social marketing, it is assumed that if a person is aware of the environmental impact of their actions, they will change their behavior. Yet, time and time again, awareness-even of economic self-interest-does not result in meaningful behavioral change. Therefore, rather than depending primarily on an informational campaign to change resident attitudes, environmental professionals have more recently looked to community-based social marketing to appeal to the individual. Community-based social marketing is a strategic process that explores and identifies the barriers to changing behavior, structures a program around those barriers, exercises this strategy on a small scale, evaluates the results, and applies the process across a given target audience. This process is applied within the target community to identify the most meaningful barriers and solutions and to provide personal interaction with individuals. These methods provide significantly higher success rates compared to social marketing campaigns. Here, case studies detailing community-based social marketing strategies that have proven successful are discussed.

Informants' stakeholder interviews and questionnaires from local fishermen were used to gain knowledge of fishing factors, perceptions and threat to the small-scale fishing community in a coastal region in the province of Phang-nga, Thailand. Results revealed communities utilising multi-geared, multi-species fisheries with a preference for marketable species that sell on a local scale. Whilst subsistence and local markets share equally the use of catches, there is a noticeable decline in small-scale fishers being recruited into the industry. This was considered by some to be due to urbanisation and by others to opportunities in tourism but was viewed as a socio-economic shift by government informants towards medium sized operations formed by resilient groups. Current management can be classified as open access, with virtually no management or regulations in place. This has led to fishers listing failing stocks and commercial fleets as the biggest threats to their livelihoods. Management initiatives are needed to focus on protecting and improving coastal stocks by clamping down on illegal activity large-scale from fishers and reviewing fishers access for resource protection.","journal":"EnvironmentAsia","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested the prediction of irreparable harm using a synthesis of recovery times compiled from 240 independent studies reported in the scientific literature. We provide startling evidence that most ecosystems globally can, given human will, recover from very major perturbations on timescales of decades to half-centuries.

There has been concern that populations, and even species, are threatened by overexploitation but little is known about the harvest or its economic importance. We studied crayfish exploitation in eastern Madagascar over 3 years. The existence of local taboos (lady) preventing commercial crayfish harvesting, as well as access to markets and forest, influenced involvement in the harvest. All four crayfish species found in the region were harvested, but A. granulimanus provided the majority of the catch. In one harvesting village more than 50% of the 47 households were directly involved in the harvest, which contributed USD 2,382 to the village economy in 2003/2004, an important sum in the context of local incomes. Subsistence use was widespread, particularly by children to whom it may provide an important protein source. Community-based conservation (through transfer of harvesting rights and responsibilities for forest management to local communities) is central to a new conservation paradigm in Madagascar. This recognizes communities' long term interest in their natural resources and offers an ideal opportunity for those concerned with the sustainability of the harvest to implement management tools (such as avoiding reproductive females, size limits and no-take zones). We discuss each tool with respect to biological implications and practical constraints. We note that community-based approaches may not be sufficient to conserve rarer species, which make up a small proportion of the value of the harvest.","journal":"Oryx","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) project examined a range of different incentives - economic, interpretative, knowledge, legal and participative - employed to address the driving forces and promote effectiveness in 20 case studies across the globe. This paper argues that, regardless of the MPA governance approach adopted (i.e., government-led, decentralised, private or community-led), resilience in MPA governance systems derives from employing a diversity of inter-connected incentives. The significance of institutional diversity to governance systems parallels that of species diversity to ecosystems, conferring resilience to the overall socio-ecological system. The paper concludes that, in the face of strong driving forces, rather than relying on particular types of incentives and institutions, it is important to recognise that the key to resilience is diversity, both of species in ecosystems and of institutions in governance systems.

This article examines three diverse community forests surrounding the national park and explores how national policy has been mediated by emerging community forestry institutions to create different levels of resource access and benefit distribution both within and between local user groups. Mindful of recent critiques of community-based conservation, the analysis gives considerable attention to the dynamics of power relations and inequality. The extent to which property rights have been transferred to the local level is evaluated and to whom power has been devolved in the process is assessed. The distribution of benefits arising from community forestry is critically examined. It seems that the current system for community forestry creates sufficient incentives for local cooperation due to the potential for increased access to important resources and a high perception of ownership of community forests among the communities. However, emerging institutions vary in the extent to which they reproduce favourable resource access conditions for elites and benefit distribution does seem to be skewed in favour of the wealthy and higher castes, even where management practices on the surface appear fair. National policy creates sufficient but not necessary conditions for achieving downward accountability, transparency and fairness. Greater attention to these issues is needed for buffer zone community forestry to better serve the poor and marginalised populations within user groups. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Perceptions of problems, and the capacity for any of these elements of society to participate in the management process, are critical factors which will influence which management issues are identified, the scale and the scope of a management plan and its implementation. This paper presents a case study of an NGO-driven effort to build capacity and begin implementing effective collaborative coastal management in the Samana bay region of the Dominican Republic. A participatory and consensus-building planning process was used to identify priority problems and strategies for solving them. Strategies were discussed jointly by local community and user groups; then combined into a preliminary regional management plan. To help the process endure and become more integrated an iterative and cyclical management approach will need to be adopted. It is uncertain whether the lack of government involvement hindered this community-based effort; however, the government's active involvement will be essential in the near future as the effort expands.","journal":"Ocean and Coastal Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Despite the knowledge of the multiple dimensions of this relationship and its importance, species and ecosystems are still disappearing at an alarming rate. Anthropogenic pressures are the prime reason for this trend, yet attempts to reduce such pressures and conserve species in protected areas have only achieved limited success. This has led to the realization that sustainable consumptive use approaches that can combine production and conservation functions are also important in conserving biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Agroforestry, as part of a multifunctional working landscape, can play a major role in conserving and even enhancing biodiversity from farms to the landscape level in both tropical and temperate regions of the world. This special issue is an attempt to bring together a collection of articles that not only explore and demonstrate the biodiversity benefits of agroforestry, but also the mechanisms by which agroforestry systems sustain such high floristic and faunal diversity. While it is important to conserve biodiversity in protected areas, the articles in the special issue reiterate the importance of agroforestry as a critical tool in conserving biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.

For the last six years, cultivators were found to be hostile towards elephants, protected areas and managers, thereby having a negative impact on conservation-based community participation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the technical reasons behind this conflict. Field data was collected from June 2008 to May 2010, to assess people's perceptions and attitudes in connection to elephant conservation. Drastic changes in the pattern of land use, elephant's attempts to enter their traditional ground, communication gaps, human causalities, an increase in the rate of crop raiding, and anthropogenic activities inside the forest areas were found to be issues behind this conflict.

It is widely recognized that the lives of humans and wildlife in this region are inextricably intertwined. However, few studies have attempted to integrate both human and wildlife dimensions using ethnographic data to better contextualize the trade and its ecological impacts. This paper outlines a methodological approach that combines ethnographic research, ecological line transects and market surveys in the Dzanga Sangha Reserve (Central African Republic). Results from each research component are reported separately in order to provide examples of how each would answer specific questions about the status of wildlife populations and the scale of hunting within a protected area. The integrated analysis of ethnographic, market and ecological datasets clarifies synergistic impacts operating in the region and provides a more nuanced understanding of changes in both the forest and the market based on information gleaned from hunting practices and hunter interviews. This research demonstrates the potential pitfalls of using a singular approach to make recommendations on complex human-environment issues. Such cross-disciplinary mixed-methods approaches will further understandings of dynamic wildlife populations and forge more informed environmental policy recommendations.

In the case of reservoir fisheries we identify various types of institutional regimes. The Tawa reservoir in Madhya Pradesh is a classic case that has experienced various management regimes in the last three decades. It provides an ideal opportunity to comprehend the performance of different regimes and their implications for productivity (efficiency criterion), wages and employment (equity criteria) and fingerlings stocking and technology use (resource sustainability criteria) across different regimes. Further, the paper details the management practices under the Tawa Matsya Sangh and emphasises that these practices should be integrated with an understanding of the resource base.","journal":"Economic and Political Weekly","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The biggest challenge currently facing the Kenyan government is how to achieve the triple developmental goals of food sufficiency, better nutrition and poverty reduction without increasing the land devoted to food crops. This paper responds to a paucity of empirical information on the impact of land degradation on farm productivity and poverty in Kenya. The paper builds on the few existing studies in this area and explores the impact of conventional inputs and adoption of soil conservation practices on farm yields per acre controlling for the effects of institutional factors. Panel data collected from farming households is utilized to achieve the study objectives. The paper tests and rejects the hypothesis that adoption of soil conservation practices has no effect on farm productivity or on poverty reduction. We test this hypothesis controlling for impacts of conventional farm inputs and institutional factors notably the property rights regimes. Due to the joint determination of soil conservation practices and productivity, we use the fixed effects - instrumental variables (FE-IV) method to isolate the productivity effects of soil conservation. We further simulate the impact of key policy changes on productivity on one hand and on poverty (head count ratio) on the other. The key finding of the paper (from the FE-IV) is that controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, soil conservation has a large measurable impact on farm productivity and on poverty reduction in the long-run. We also find that well specified property rights are associated with higher farm productivity, a debate that is widely contested in the literature. Policy simulations indicate that privatization of common land and adoption of particular soil conservation practices can play a decisive role in increasing agricultural yields and in reducing poverty in semi-arid areas.","journal":"Journal of Food, Agriculture and Environment","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

W.","year":2009,"title":"Participatory planning, management and alternative livelihoods for poor wetland-dependent communities in Kampala, Uganda","dAbstract":"The paper is based on an on-going 3-year study in the wetland communities of Kampala. The study uses participatory methods and aims to contribute to (i) the development of low-income wetland communities, (ii) to prepare these communities to become less dependent on wetlands without receding into poverty, and (iii) the better management of the wetlands. The communities in direct dependence and intimate interaction with Nakivubo wetlands are mainly poor, live and work under hazardous conditions, and their activities pose a threat to the ecological function of the wetlands. Yet these wetlands are important for filtering the city's waste and storm water before it flows into Lake Victoria's Murchison Bay, which is Kampala's source of piped water. Government approaches to the problem of wetland encroachment have largely failed because they are confrontational, and are not consistent or participatory. The study has in the first year conducted a series of activities including stakeholder analysis, resource analysis, livelihood analysis, a questionnaire survey and action planning. Preliminary data show that wetland dependency is very high among the poor nearby communities. They practice cultivation, brick-making and harvesting of wetland vegetation. However, these activities are under threat because wetland resources are dwindling due to increasing population and over-use. Livelihoods are threatened not only by the decreasing productivity of the wetland, but also by the ever-present government threat to evict wetland encroachers to restore its ecology. The study therefore works with communities to prepare for less dependence on wetlands so that they do not suddenly recede into worse poverty if they are evicted. They formulate strategies to enhance alternative livelihood, and for management of the wetland. Action plans have been formulated to address the situation through a newly created association.

Located in southern part of Iran, this wetland serves many functions. Among them the rich biodiversity, ecological, hydrological, and economic functions are the most important. Despite the great opportunities for sustainable development of this wetland, it is currently under serious threats from a diverse range of non-sustainable activities. Underestimating SIW's non-market values in development decisions is a major reason for the conversion and excessive depletion of its resources. The aim of this study was therefore to estimate the economic benefit of SIW as a very useful instrument to reflect the values of this unique ecosystem to society members. A choice experiment (CE) survey was undertaken to estimate the value of different nonmarket attributes of SIW. In addition to the overall model, users and nonusers preferences were also estimated. Random parameter logit (RPL) model was employed to derive the marginal value of the respondents for different attributes of the nonmarket values of SIW.

Why conservation should help meet basic human needs in the tropics","dAbstract":"For hundreds of millions of people, biodiversity is about eating, staying healthy, and finding shelter. Meeting these people's basic needs should receive greater priority in the conservation agenda. Wild and semi-wild plants and animals contribute significantly to nutrition, health care, income, and culture in developing countries, and the poorest and most vulnerable people often rely on those resources most. Depleting those resources or making them inaccessible can impoverish these people even further. 'Pro-poor conservation' - that is, conservation that aims to support poor people - explicitly seeks to address basic human needs. Such an emphasis has many potential synergies with more conventional conservation goals. Nonetheless, pro-poor conservation requires a distinct attitude to gauging conservation outcomes and a different approach to conservation science. Biologists can make a vital contribution.

Although evidence is mixed in suggesting that these resident stakeholders are optimal forest stewards, it is highly unlikely that large tracts of tropical forests will be conserved without engaging local people who depend on them daily for their livelihoods. Stakeholders, who reside in biodiverse ecosystems like tropical forests, are the largest direct users and ultimate decision-makers of forest fate, can be important investors in conservation, harbor local ecological knowledge that complements Western science and frequently have long-term legitimate claims on lands where they reside. Research partnerships with local stakeholders can increase research relevance, enhance knowledge exchange and result in greater conservation success. Different phases of the research cycle present distinct opportunities for partnership, with flexibility in timing, approaches and strategies depending on researcher and local stakeholder needs and interests. Despite being the last step in the research process, dissemination of results can be the best starting point for researchers interested in experimenting with local stakeholder engagement. Still, tropical biologists might not choose to partner with local people because of lack of institutional rewards, insufficient training in stakeholder engagement, insecure research infrastructure in community settings, and time and funding limitations. Although not appropriate in all cases and despite significant challenges, some biological scientists and research institutions have successfully engaged local stakeholders in the research process, proving mutually beneficial for investigators and local people alike and resulting in important innovations in tropical biology and conservation.

There is new and increasing emphasis on the contribution of non-timber forest products in improving livelihoods and in managing the forest ecosystems of the Miombo woodlands sustainably. This study, conducted in the Mwekera area of Copperbelt Province, Zambia, determined the role of indigenous fruit trees in rural livelihoods. A variety of participatory rural appraisal techniques and a household survey were used to collect data on the use of indigenous fruits. The study revealed that 99% of the respondents experience hunger every year during the rainy season from November to April. Up to 97% of the rural people in the area collect indigenous fruit (IFs) such as Uapaca kirkiana, Anisophyllea boehmii, and Parinari curatellifolia, ranked in order of importance. On the other hand, relatively few households (31%) sell indigenous fruits. Uapaca kirkiana and Anisophyllea boehmii accounted for 95% of the fruits sold. Nearly half (46%) of the rural people in the area process fruits into juice and/or porridge. It was concluded that the major contribution of IFTs in the study area was in relieving hunger rather than as a source of income through selling. It is recommended that domestication of indigenous fruits and sustainable forestry and agricultural management practices be employed to ensure that future generations continue to benefit from the forest resource.","journal":"Book Section","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The study employed focus group meetings, in-depth interviews, and interviews of households, as stratified by wealth class and head of household gender in Copperbelt, Zambia. The results show that FPES are vitally important in providing food, medicine, fodder, and construction materials to rural livelihoods. FPES provided 43.9 % of the average household's income and contributed a 10 % income equalisation effect among households, as revealed by the Gini-coefficient analysis. Poorer households received a lower mean annual income from forests than did their intermediate and wealthy counterparts, but in relative terms, forest income made the greatest contribution to the total household incomes of poor households. When stratified by gender, forests contributed 44.4 and 41.8 % of the income of male- and female-headed households, respectively. The study indicates that wealth, rather than gender, was the key determinant of a household's engagement in the sale of FPES. The inter- and intra-community differentiation in the use and sale of FPES, as revealed in this study, enables more effective targeting of forest management interventions and informs efforts to reconcile the goals of poverty reduction and forest conservation.

It assesses the influence of socio-economic factors (wealth and gender) in households' coping decisions. The study employs a mixed methods approach by combining focus groups meetings, in-depth interviews, and interviews of 244 households stratified by household wealth classes and gender of household heads in Copperbelt province, Zambia. The results show that households face multiple shocks and that FPES are the most widely used coping strategy used by households facing idiosyncratic shocks, by households, followed by kinship. A higher proportion of poor and intermediate households rely on FPES to cope with various shocks than their wealthier counterparts. When stratified by gender, more male-headed households used FPES than female headed households. With respect to coping with household food stresses, charcoal production and sale is the most widely used strategy, followed by off-farm activities and remittances. In designing forest management strategies aimed at reconciling forest conservation and rural development, such as reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) schemes, it is vitally important that alternate coping strategies are made available to rural households to reduce pressure on forests.

The adaptation policy framework (APF) sets out indicative activities and features of an adaptation strategy. Understanding the extent to which existing practices can support adaptation in societies and ecosystems is an important step towards the solution. This study uses vulnerability, policy and financial analyses to investigate the compatibility of the modified taungya system (MTS) (a reforestation programme) in Ghana with the indicative activities of the APF. The findings indicate that MTS takes into consideration most of the activities of an adaptation strategy, is a profitable venture (BCR > 1) and has a high potential to reduce vulnerability due to short-term food production and long-term plantation establishment. Resource management in MTS is promising in the short term, but challenges remain to meet livelihood and adaptation needs in the medium and long term. Policy instruments related to MTS align with the forestry, climate change and the development goals of Ghana. We conclude that MTS is a potential win-win practice for forestry and adaptation. The legalization of all contractual arrangements coupled with continuous monitoring, evaluation and improvement may drive MTS to become a lasting activity that will support the long-term horizon of an adaptation strategy.

Little is known about why preferences vary greatly and how this affects support for management actions. This paper explores preferences for a range of wildlife species among a sample of the rural population adjacent to Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. We also examine the degree of acceptance for alternative management interventions when potentially dangerous animals pose different levels of problems to human beings, and the extent to which these attitudes are related to species preferences. Gender has a significant effect on species preferences. Men like most species better than women. Age has no significant effect, but level of education affects preference level for some species. Species preferences have a positive effect on support for management intervention when dangerous animals cause small or moderate problems to humans, i.e. there is a higher degree of acceptance of problems caused by animals that are well liked. In situations where human life is threatened, species preferences have no effect on preferred management actions. Appreciation of animals is a combination of functional, consumptive and cultural dimensions, and there is no simple link between species preferences and attitudes toward management actions. The local context and concrete experience with wildlife encounters is more important for shaping normative beliefs like attitudes towards management actions than global wildlife attitudes.

Poaching has remained a persistent problem through the 50 year long history of Serengeti National Park. Around 2 million people live along the borders of the park. Poverty is widespread, and the population is increasing rapidly. In this paper we examine the local perceptions of importance and reasons for hunting, gender differences and opinions about mitigating measures among villagers around Serengeti's Western Corridor. The data were collected through interviewing 590 persons in eight villages close to the borders of the park. Hunting is driven by the need to not only increase food supply and cash income, but also fulfil cultural and social needs. We also identified a proactive attitude in the rural communities towards reducing illegal hunting and more constructive relationships with the management authorities of the national park. The role of hunting in community life extends beyond the immediate poverty issue, and should be seen as an element in the larger development agenda of rural Tanzania and the quest for models for sustainable wildlife management.

The park has played a pivotal role in protecting large populations of wildlife species of the Eastern African savannah and the globally outstanding biological phenomena such as the annual migration of wildebeest. However, the history of the park is also characterised by resource use conflicts and pressures that could threaten the current quality of the visitor environment. In this paper we examine the attitudes of international visitors toward the management and attributes of the park. Overall, the tourists report a high degree of satisfaction with most aspects of their trip. Yet, the current tourists are concerned about possible future changes that could alter the visitor environment and idealized images of the African wild lands. Basic environmental attitudes (degrees of ecocentrism) have effects on attitudes toward management of the park. Tourists expressing a high degree of ecocentrism are more likely to support management actions aimed at controlling tourism activities, access and impacts. They also express a stronger interest in experiencing nature, wilderness and local culture. The results are discussed in light of the major impact factors and conservation issues facing the management of Serengeti National Park; poaching, poverty in surrounding communities, increasing population pressure, habitat degradation, and wildlife diseases.

People are extremely poor, with 97% having incomes of less than 1Â USD/day. Forest income constitutes around 15% of total income; only non-farm income (47%) and agriculture (28%) rank higher. The poorest segment depends more on forest income than the least poor group, but the medium income group exhibits the highest dependence. Fuelwood constitutes the major source of such income followed by fodder. The incomes mainly support current consumption. People with better access to the forest reserve have higher total income, forest income, and relative forest income. As revealed through a Gini-coefficient analysis, forest resources have an important income equalizing effect across rural households. A particular group of resource poor farmers (8.1% of sample), with little access to agricultural land and a high representation of female heads, derives an average of 65% of their income from the forest. An important policy lesson is that restricting people's access to forest resources can have substantial effects on household livelihoods and welfare, and would serve to increase income inequalities in the area. Livelihood researchers should now recognize the substantial income from forest resources. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Community based natural resource management and the neglect of local institutions in policy development","dAbstract":"Approaches to natural resource management emphasise the importance of involving local people and institutions in order to build capacity, limit costs, and achieve environmental sustainability. Governments worldwide, often encouraged by international donors, have formulated devolution policies and legal instruments that provide an enabling environment for devolved natural resource management. However, implementation of these policies reveals serious challenges. This article explores the effects of limited involvement of local people and institutions in policy development and implementation. An in-depth study of the Forest Policy of Malawi and Village Forest Areas in the Lilongwe district provides an example of externally driven policy development which seeks to promote local management of natural resources. The article argues that policy which has weak ownership by national government and does not adequately consider the complexity of local institutions, together with the effects of previous initiatives on them, can create a cumulative legacy through which destructive resource use practices and social conflict may be reinforced. In short, poorly developed and implemented community based natural resource management policies can do considerably more harm than good. Approaches are needed that enable the policy development process to embed an in-depth understanding of local institutions whilst incorporating flexibility to account for their location-specific nature. This demands further research on policy design to enable rigorous identification of positive and negative institutions and ex-ante exploration of the likely effects of different policy interventions.

Variation also exists within individual programmes, creating the potential for conflict if management does not recognize that these differences can indicate competing interests and needs. In this study we examine livelihood activities at the household level in a wildlife conservancy along the Kwando River in the Caprivi region of Namibia. We ask how people in the conservancy make their livelihoods and what differences exist between the conservancy's riverside and inland populations. The study finds that the inland population, c. 20 km from the river on slightly heavier soils, engages in fewer livelihood activities and has greater food security than does the riverside population. We further establish that differences between the two populations are significant enough to indicate two distinct combinations of livelihood activities with different environmental interactions. These findings suggest that any management action taken by the conservancy will affect household livelihoods differently based on location and that these differences must be considered if the conservancy is to make a successful transition from a subsistence-based agricultural system to a wildlife-based economy.

However, lack of active involvement in planning and limited access to conservation areas makes the economic prospects of initiatives like the Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) rather questionable. This study was undertaken in the Mbarang'andu WMA in Namtumbo District, Tanzania to assess the contribution of community-based conservation approaches such as WMAs in enhancing conservation of wildlife resources and poverty alleviation around protected areas. The study methods used included participatory rural appraisal, key informant interviews, direct field observations and household survey. A sample of 10% of the village households was selected for interview. LandSat images from 1995 were used in mapping the physical resource base and land use/cover types of the district. Household data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Findings from the study indicate that much of the village land has been allocated for biodiversity conservation in form of forests and/or WMAs. However, there is little evidence to show the results of such interventions in terms of poverty alleviation, which constrains other local livelihoods while benefiting distant resource users such as private investors. The article argues that to enhance local involvement in conservation of biodiversity while addressing poverty issues, mechanisms for accessing wildlife and forest resources would need to be reconsidered. In particular, this study establishes that the hunting quotas to the villages surrounding the WMA need to be increased to enhance community access to animal protein.

This paper examines NTFPs' role in contributing to the household economy and how different socio-economic factors may influence this contribution. Field methods involved quantitative and qualitative data collection of forest-adjacent households of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. Results show that the contribution of different types of NTFPs to household economy varies in terms of subsistence and cash income. However, overall NTFP income is much higher than income from timber or firewood which indicates a larger dependence of the households on NTFPs. Income data analysis also finds that the poor households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs for their subsistence and cash income than the better-off households. Moreover, the study reveals that there are many other socio-economic factors at the household level such as number of members in household and total value of household implements and furniture that are significantly correlated with the NTFP income. More site-specific applied research on NTFP income and influential factors is necessary to generalize the findings for other parts of the world with similar socio-economic and environmental settings.

Results suggest that CHT's NTFP market systems suffer from poor transportation facilities, communication systems, financial capital or credit access, and market information and linkages. NTFP market knowledge and information among households is deficient and limited. NTFP market knowledge is significantly influenced by various socioeconomic factors such as household member's education, sex, household's income and ethnicity, distance to market and road access.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

We focus on India to discern trends and implications of nature-based tourism in an emerging economy. We interviewed 91% of tourist facilities around 10 PAs to assess visitation, employment, and practices. Average growth rate was 14.9% (from -7% in Bandipur to 44% in Periyar from 2002 to 2008) and 80% are domestic tourists. Many facilities (72% post 2000) are recently constructed and 85% occur within 5 km of PAs. Clustering of facilities in some PAs might facilitate easier management of resource use and establishment of best practice guidelines. Contributions of facilities to local employment are marginal. Rules governing entry of people and vehicles vary widely. Domestic nature-based tourism potentially generates public support for conservation but adds to existing challenges of managing PAs already facing pressure from livelihood needs of local populations. Based on these trends, the increasing middle class in India is likely to generate future demand for nature-based tourism counter to trends in industrialized countries. There is urgent need for establishing and enforcing regulations to manage tourists, resource use, and land-use change around PAs.","journal":"Conservation Letters","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Polarized debates on the effectiveness of protected areas and role of people inside them, charismatic species as conservation foci, and on specific policy initiatives are common among Indian and global conservationists. We surveyed Indian conservationists about the conservation effectiveness of protected areas and charismatic species, as well as status of conservation and research efforts. We expected differences among people based on professional affiliation, and educational background. We examined participants' opinions on conservation policies like Project Tiger and Elephant, the Forest Rights Act, and the Tiger Task Force Report. Participants ranked Indian research efforts as average, and identified a bias towards terrestrial species and ecosystems. Ninety-percent of participants considered reserves to be effective, many (61%) participants felt that the situation of people living inside reserves is unsustainable, and many (76%) felt the use of force to protect reserves from illegal human activities is acceptable. Classification and regression tree models for these questions suggested that non-academics were more likely than academics to agree with these positions. On the success of Project Tiger and Elephant, older participants were more likely to think these initiatives were a success. Many (63%) participants felt the Forest Rights Act needed revision, particularly if they had doctoral degrees. Sixty-two percent of participants did not think Tiger Task Force was effective. Overall, participants' professional affiliation, age, and academic degree were important predictors of participants attitudes towards conservation initiatives. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a survey of 777 households around five PAs in India and Nepal, this paper provides a comparative perspective of Indian and Nepali households' views of protected area benefits and costs, their attitude toward conservation in general, and attitude toward protected area staff. Results indicate mixed responses towards tourism, varying from very favorable in Nepal to less favorable in India. The majority (81%) held positive attitudes towards the existence and importance of PAs but had negative perceptions of PA staff (69%). Most residents perceived benefits from access to fuel wood, fodder and other PA resources including benefits from tourism, while crop and livestock losses from wildlife were the main costs. Households overall positive attitudes towards the PAs and conservation despite high losses from living around PAs suggests that local residents may support conservation if their livelihood needs are met. Comparisons of household attitudes and perceptions suggest that locally based strategies rather than top-down approaches are likely to be more effective. Extending PA benefits to smaller landholders, households that are highly resource-dependent or experiencing higher income losses from human-wildlife conflicts, and less educated residents are particularly important to balance costs and losses from living around protected areas.

Most notably, scientists now widely acknowledge that we live in a world dominated by humans, and therefore, the scientific underpinnings of conservation must include a consideration of the role of humans. Today's conservation science incorporates conservation biology into a broader interdisciplinary field that explicitly recognizes the tight coupling of social and natural systems. Emerging priorities include pursuing conservation within working landscapes, rebuilding public support, working with the corporate sector, and paying better attention to human rights and equity. We argue that in conservation, strategies must be promoted that simultaneously maximize the preservation of biodiversity and the improvement of human well-being.

This can lead to different, sometimes contradictory, outcomes of conservation. We studied local perceptions of ecosystem service flows in the Ranomafana National Park area of Madagascar to examine the local outcomes of conservation. The Ranomafana forest area provides a variety of benefits that contribute considerably to local inhabitants' livelihoods and well-being. Changes in ecosystem service flows alter the provision of many important ecosystem services at the local level, which is likely to affect local livelihoods negatively and increase local vulnerability and inequality. The findings indicate the presence of trade-offs between types of ecosystem services and between different societal goals, namely conservation and development. Benefit trade-offs also occur within and between beneficiary groups and across spatial and temporal scales. Although conservation might prove beneficial for local people in the long run, its immediate local costs are high. The findings reveal the importance of integrating local perceptions of ecosystem services into conservation planning. In addition, there is a need for further negotiations of the trade-offs between ecosystem services, conservation and development in Ranomafana.

Livelihoods are best examined through Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF), which is based on the premise that livelihood is not about resource productivity but it is about people and their lives. Livelihoods are sustainable when they are: a) resilient to shocks and stresses, b) independent of external support, c) maintain the productivity (and diversity) of natural stocks; and d) do not adversely affect the livelihoods of others. In other words, SLF: a) builds on the strengths of people, their resources and knowledge systems, b) strengthens local institutional capacity, c) attempts to remove conditions causing poverty rather than poverty itself, and d) gives priority to improving policies, processes and institutions in developing and implementing programs. Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP)-based livelihood systems are often mediated by the market forces and/or related directly to employment and income of the poor people. Based on the research work carried out by IDRC supported research in South Asia, we find that MAP and other biodiversity-based livelihoods can not only become poverty reducing they can also be made socially equitable and gender balanced. However, the interventions have to be carefully designed to enhance and diversify livelihood strategies with a focus on strengthening existing biodiversity-based livelihoods by considering the following points: a) both non-monetary and monetary benefits from biodiversity-based livelihoods; b) improving linkages and synergies with and amongst other components of biodiversity; c) landscape-scale management practices that protect or enhance biodiversity (organic farming, mixed farming, community forest management, water management to enhance aquatic resources, opposition to enclosure of the commons, etc.). MAP-based livelihoods can be easily mainstreamed with other components to enhance human welfare, especially among the poor and marginalized communities.

{"author":"Karki, S. T.","year":2013,"title":"Do protected areas and conservation incentives contribute to sustainable livelihoods? A case study of Bardia National Park, Nepal","dAbstract":"Effective biodiversity protection and improved human welfare as 'win-win' situations have been the foundation for protected areas and conservation incentives. However, conserving land in this way can become a development issue that restricts agricultural expansion and resource exploitation, with potentially substantial costs to people living in conditions of high social impoverishment and high critical natural capital. This paper investigates whether Nepal's Bardia National Park and conservation incentives have contributed to the sustainable livelihoods of households. Data on household livelihoods and conservation benefits were collected through a questionnaire survey of 358 households and community workshops in three villages. Different impacts on household livelihoods were observed between the villages. It was found that these impacts were dependent on household characteristics, access to prior capital, and the social position of the household within society. Households lacking resources, being poor and belonging to lower castes were least included and also benefited less from development projects. As finance in the form of development projects from organisations continues to flow to the communities, it is important that detailed livelihood planning focussing on alternative regenerative livelihoods and micro-enterprises in the informal sector is included to target those households that are highly dependent on park resources. Livelihood planning must also include a clear linkage between livelihood enhancing activities and the conservation programme so that communities are aware that the benefits they receive are due to the protected area. Appreciation of benefits and their positive impact on livelihoods is important for the sustainability of incentive-based programmes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

K.","year":2013,"title":"Perceptions matter: how fishermen's perceptions affect trends of sustainability in Indian fisheries","dAbstract":"ABSTRACT: Indian marine fisheries have expanded four-fold in the last 50 years in the form of open-access commons. Although studies predict that fish stocks are on the decline there is little evidence that these declines are being countered by changes in either fishing regulations or fishing practices. Fishermen rarely comply with regulations, instead operationalizing and directing the fishery on their own. In these circumstances understanding how fishermen perceive and use resources has significant management and policy implications. Our study examined fishermen's perceptions about the state of fish stocks and documents current fishing practice and management strategies in India. We surveyed 342 fishermen in two states, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. We found that 86% of fishermen perceived a decline in catch and 69% perceived a decline in bycatch. Fishermen adapt to these declines by increasing fishing area and time spent, changing their gear, and overlapping in fishing zones. The convoluted interactions between ineffective community and state regulations guiding their actions has prevented fishermen from developing successful models of sustainable fisheries management. We identified non-compliance with regulations and government incentives as an important livelihood opportunity. Non-compliance drives change in fishing practice by giving fishermen the flexibility to respond to perceived fish catch dynamics by modifying their practices. We recommend strengthening local fishing communities by enabling them to enforce fishing regulations locally and by scaling back of existing government incentives, to protect the sustainability of these fisheries.","journal":"Oryx","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Ninety-five fishermen living in a coastal park (Ponta do TubarÃ£o Sustainable Development Reserve) in the Brazilian northeast, where controlled exploitation of natural resources is allowed, took part in this study. The results showed that age alone would not affect compliance, regardless of the level of enforcement. However, it was noticed that the fishermen who claimed to depend on the money provided by fisheries, regardless of their age, were more likely to say that they would not comply, even if enforcement were stricter. The scenario analysis showed that increased monitoring and punishment (including societal pressure) could enhance compliance, especially among younger fishermen, who claimed not to depend solely on fisheries. Therefore, fisheries management should also consider differences in social groups, and not focus solely on the enforcement and punishment mechanisms, assuring that livelihood options that consider different social needs are provided.

This paper presents lessons from an assessment of an autonomous adaptation in the Great Ruaha River catchment in Tanzania following WWF intervention. The project was designed to address challenges resulting from natural resource use and existing levels of climate variability by changing water resource management. The study applied participatory methods and an open-ended questionnaire to collect data. The study found key adaptation benefits, including reduced vulnerability to drought and strengthened local water user associations and other regional institutions. As a result of the project interventions from 2003 to 2009, rural livelihoods became more profitable and water-sustainable, and local livelihood strategies were diversified. Regional ecosystems improved as a result of restoring river flows in some rivers, conservation of riparian vegetation and halting tree felling for charcoal production. As a result of these changes the communities and ecosystems in the Great Ruaha River catchment should be more resilient to emerging climate change impacts, yet the need for further physical interventions and institutional reform is identified. The study concludes that strengthening local institutions and capacity building are fundamental to climate change adaptation and sustainable freshwater management.

{"author":"Kashwan, P.","year":2013,"title":"The politics of rights-based approaches in conservation","dAbstract":"Scholars and advocates increasingly favor rights-based approaches over traditional exclusionary policies in conservation. Yet, national and international conservation policies and programs have often led to the exclusion of forest-dependent peoples. This article proposes and tests the hypothesis that the failures of rights-based approaches in conservation can be attributed in significant measure to the political economic interest of the state in the tropics. To this end, the article presents findings from the empirical analysis of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in India. Two key recommendations emerge from this analysis. One, the proposals for operationalizing rights-based approaches will likely be far more effective if they protect the inalienability of a minimal set of rights critical to the subsistence and well-being of forest people, as opposed to promising the protection of an expansive set of rights subject to the instrumentality of conservation. Two, the proponents of rights-based approaches in conservation need to guard against their actions reinforcing the institutional status quo of the state control of forests. This, in turn, requires international conservation groups to join hands with national forest rights movements.

Participatory methods were employed to collect data, and a dynamic modeling technique was applied to explore trends over time. By integrating the more quantitative model outputs with qualitative insights, information on forests and livelihoods was summarized and returned to users, both to inform them and get feedback. A scenario of open access without PFM provides higher income benefits in the short term but not over the longer term, as compared to a scenario with PFM. Follow up meetings were organized with national decision makers to explore the possibility of new provisions in the national forest proclamation related to joint community-state ownership of forests. Project implementers must constantly work towards improving short term incentives from PFM, as these may be insufficient to garner support for PFM. Other necessary elements for PFM to succeed include: ensuring active participation of the communities in the process; and, clarifying and harmonizing the rules and regulations at different levels.

They are specifically designed to address the impacts that remain in such a way that the offset can reasonably be predicted, on the basis of our scientific understanding, to result in no net loss of biodiversity from the perspective of relevant stakeholders. Recognising the lack of an international, multistakeholder forum in which to develop shared terminology, increase understanding and share best practice on biodiversity offsets; the lack of practical experience in this field and the lack of guidance on biodiversity offset design (particularly on how to quantify loss and gain of biodiversity and establish the equivalence of offsets to the residual losses caused by projects BBOP was established in 2004. It is nowa collaboration between some 75 organisations: companies, government agencies, conservation organizations and financial institutions from around the world, as well as some independent experts. The aim of BBOP is to develop shared views and experience of best practice in following the mitigation hierarchy and demonstrating 'no net loss' or a 'net gain' of biodiversity, including through the use of biodiversity offsets. Over its initial four years, the members of BBOP's Advisory Group developed a set of ten principles and methodologies required to support best practice in voluntary biodiversity offsets. They tested these in a series of pilot projects, whilst opening broader consultation with policy makers and other stakeholder groups. This paper covers two significant, recent developments. The first is a major driver for biodiversity offsets and key aspect of access to finance, namely the IFC's revised Performance Standard 6 (PS6), also adopted as of 1 January 2012 by the 73 financial institutions that are members of the Equator Principles Association. PS6 requires clients receiving project finance to demonstrate no net loss of biodiversity, where feasible, for impacts on 'natural habitat', and in the case of impacts on 'critical habitats', clients must show a net gain. The second, related, development is the Standard on Biodiversity Offsets, also released in January 2012. This was developed by members of the BBOP Secretariat and Advisory Group. Their aim was to help companies and their auditors and investors determine whether international best practice has been followed in avoiding and minimizing impacts on biodiversity, undertaking restoration, and ultimately offsetting any residual impacts in order to demonstrate no net loss, or preferably a net gain, of biodiversity. The standard presents criteria and indicators that build on theBBOP Principles that define best practice in biodiversity offsets. It is accompanied by guidance notes for assessors and a glossary. It is the product of seven years of experimentation and negotiation among over eighty companies, governments, civil society organizations, research groups and financial institutions from around the world, as well as public consultations. The BBOP Standard complements other standards on carbon, and water, and guidelines on alleviation of poverty and helps companies show they meet safeguards established by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. BBOP is conducting a range of training programmes for companies, consultants, investors, conservation experts and government representatives and coordinating a 'Community of Practice' to enable anyone - whether a BBOP member or not - to share practical experiences, skills and lessons learned on applying the mitigation hierarchy and achieving no net loss. BBOP also plans to collaborate with more individuals and organisations around the world, continually to refine the Standard based on experience and practice, and to learn from a wide range of experiences with biodiversity offsets in a variety of industry sectors and geographical areas. The BBOP Secretariat (serve by Forest Trends and the Wildlife Conservation Society) is looking for organizations willing to try using the Standard and offer feedback on its strengths and weaknesses, so it can be improved in subsequent editions. BBOP is a collaborative programme, and welcomes participation and feedback from any interested organisation.

The elevation of the area ranges from 600m to 2100 m from sea level. More than 1000 visitors pay their visit to this hill resort daily. It is situated about 65km North of Islamabad. This area is geographically known as \"Foot hill of Himalayas\". Murree is very important location due to its forest cover mainly comprising of Chir pine and Blue pine forests; that not only provide timber, fuel wood, and other non-timber benefits to community but also serve as watershed area and a magnificent picnic spot. Eco-tourism is a multimillion enterprise in Murree. More than one million tourists visit Murree each year. The population of Murree grows up 10 times more than the local population during the hot summer spell in the country and winter season during snow fall. Most of the local people are associated directly or indirectly to this industry. In true sense, Ecotourism plays a vital role in the improvement of socioeconomic conditions of the local community. To find out the role of ecotourism and public preferences towards interest of nature conservation, a survey of visitors was conducted; using a structured questionnaire in three most busy locations, The Mall, Patriata and Bhurban. The reported onsite experiences of respondents were analyzed to identify important factors that motivated them to visit the site and had effect on their conservation attitudes and to assess the visitor's behavior towards forest based ecotourism and analyzed their preferences regarding \"quality ranking\" as a recreational spot and possible improvements for further recreational development without damaging the habitat. From a total samples of 180 respondents, 52.78 % preferred Muree Hill resort for the enjoyment from the view point of forests flora and fauna and natural beauty, 32.78% responded for general environment, 2.22% for near distance location and 5% did not specify any particular reason for their visit. There is significant relationship between the specific objective \"to enjoy scenery and forests\" and their first time visit or yearly visit to the forest area. The results of F-distribution at 95 % confidence interval showed significant relationship between specific objective \"to enhance knowledge\" and their first time visit or the yearly visit to the forest area.

Individuals and group interviews were administered on the respondents through the use of a semi-structured matrix with a view to determining their conservation perception on the endangered tree species in their vicinity. The abundance of species identified as being endangered was determined from areas lying within a 10 km radius from each village center. The Index of Similarity (IS) among the endangered trees in the three zones was also determined. A total of forty-eight local tree species was identified as being endangered. All these species that possessed various ethnobotanical importances were now rare on the abundance scale.

The key word of the Convention is 'Safeguarding' which is defined as \"measures aimed at ensuring the viability of the intangible cultural heritage, including the identification, documentation, research, preservation, protection, promotion, enhancement, transmission, particularly through formal and non formal education, as well as the revitalization of the various aspects of such heritage\" [Article 2.3]. This is a commendable step by UNESCO, given that the 1972 UNESCO Convention has for more than 30 years focused specifically on the tangible aspects of cultural heritage. Article 15 of the 2003 Convention on intangible heritage makes reference to issues relating to the \"Participation of communities, groups and individuals\". A focus on communities means that the Convention must face very varied national and community perspectives. This article focuses on elements of the 2003 UNESCO Convention to investigate implications for the sustainable existence and utilization of intangible heritage in a context of an African community in Botswana. It is concluded that safeguarding elements of intangible heritage by creating inventories and representative lists [Articles 12 and 16] can reduce the value of the cultural capital together with the social capital upon which the heritage exists by making some elements of intangible heritage ubiquitous, in the process lessening their existence and use values and thus disrupting the socio-cultural contexts within which these elements exist.

Overexploited fisheries upset the balance between local economic needs and endangered species' conservation. We investigated resource competition between fisheries and Ganges river dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) in a human-dominated river system in India to assess the potential for their coexistence. We surveyed a 65-km stretch of the lower Ganga River to assess habitat use by dolphins (encounter rates) and fishing activity (habitat preferences of fishers, intensity of net and boat use). Dolphin abundance in the main channel increased from 179 (SE 7) (mid dry season) to 270 (SE 8) (peak dry season), probably as a result of immigration from upstream tributaries. Dolphins preferred river channels with muddy, rocky substrates, and deep midchannel waters. These areas overlapped considerably with fishing areas. Sites with 2-6 boats/. km (moderately fished) were more preferred by dolphins than sites with 8-55 boats/. km (heavily fished). Estimated spatial (85%) and prey-resource overlap (75%) between fisheries and dolphins (chiefly predators of small fish) suggests a high level of competition between the two groups. A decrease in abundance of larger fish, indicated by the fact that small fish comprised 74% of the total caught, may have intensified the present competition. Dolphins seem resilient to changes in fish community structure and may persist in overfished rivers. Regulated fishing in dolphin hotspots and maintenance of adequate dry season flows can sustain dolphins in tributaries and reduce competition in the main river. Fish-stock restoration and management, effective monitoring, curbing destructive fishing practices, secure tenure rights, and provision of alternative livelihoods for fishers may help reconcile conservation and local needs in overexploited river systems.

The rationale for CNRM is often compelling and convincing. Relatively little data exists, however, regarding its implementation, particularly the reconciliation of social and environmental goals. This article summarizes empirical evidence regarding the implementation of CNRM, based on five case studies in Nepal, the U.S. states of Alaska and Washington, and Kenya. Six social and environmental indicators are used to evaluate and compare these cases, including equity, empowerment, conflict resolution, knowledge and awareness, biodiversity protection, and sustainable resource utilization. The results of this analysis indicate that, despite sincere attempts and some success, serious deficiencies are widely evident. In especially Nepal and Kenya, CNRM rarely resulted in more equitable distribution of power and economic benefits, reduced conflict, increased consideration of traditional or modern environmental knowledge, protection of biological diversity, or sustainable resource use. By contrast, CNRM in the North American cases was more successful. Institutional, environmental, and organizational factors help explain the observed differences.","journal":"Society and Natural Resources","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Population pressuresmean thatmany of these grasslands are in a degraded state, particularly in less-productive areas of developing countries, affecting not only productivity but also vital environmental services such as hydrology, biodiversity, andcarbon cycles; livestock condition is often poor and household incomes are at or below poverty levels. The challenge is to optimize management practices that result in \"win-win\" outcomes for grasslands, the environment, and households. A case study is discussed from northwestern China, where it has been possible to reduce animal numbers considerably by usingan energy-balance/market-based approach while improving household incomes, providing conditions within which grassland recovery is possible. This bottom-up approach was supported by informing and working with the six layers of government in China to build appropriate policies. Further policy implications are considered. Additional gains in grassland rehabilitation could be fostered through targeted environmental payment schemes. Other aspects of the livestock production system that can be modified are discussed.

But how do such processes work in practice, especially where conflicts over resource use are much in evidence? Through a case study of the Mkambati area of the Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape, this article explores how the interaction of social and ecological dynamics affects the livelihoods of the rural poor who live near protected conservation areas. Through the use of an environmental entitlements analysis, the case study shows how different social actors derive livelihoods from a range of natural resources and how access to and control over these resources is mediated by a set of interacting and overlapping institutions which are embedded in the political and social life of the area. An understanding of this complex set of institutional relationships is seen to be a vital precursor to establishing a framework for negotiation around competing claims, and the exploration of any co-management options for the nature reserve area.","journal":"IDS Bulletin","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

However, the perceptions of biodiversity by tourists have rarely been evaluated. We assessed this during self-guided wildlife viewing in the Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa, and evaluated the effects of guides on day- and night-drives on the tourists' perceptions of faunal biodiversity. Self-guided tourists recorded seeing few mammals, reptiles and birds, these being largely limited to the large, charismatic and open-habitat species. Self-guided tourists who had seen elephants expressed satisfaction with their wildlife viewing, although some expressed a wish to have seen other vertebrates. Tourists who participated in guided day-drives saw more species than self-guided tourists, while those who participated in guided night-drives saw the greatest diversity of vertebrates. In general, tourist interest in biodiversity was largely focused on a few vertebrates; while invertebrates (with the exception of the flightless dung beetle) and plants were largely ignored. We suggest that the quality of wildlife viewing may be significantly improved through the use of guides. Guiding offers an opportunity to expand the community involvement (through employing game-guides) and environmental education components of ecotourism. The findings of this study indicate that tourists focus on a few charismatic species and may hold misconceptions of the nature of biodiversity. We argue that the assumption of an umbrella role of a few charismatic species in protecting ecosystems and their constituent biodiversity is probably precarious. It is imperative that the public, and politicians who make decisions regarding the conservation of biodiversity, are sensitized to the value of biodiversity. Traditional self-guided wildlife viewing in conservation areas generally leads to the tourists having a lesser wildlife experience, which undervalues biodiversity as an ecotourism resource.","journal":"South African Journal of Wildlife Research","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Khadka, D.; Nepal, S. K.","year":2010,"title":"Local responses to participatory conservation in Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal","dAbstract":"Biodiversity conservation has undergone a profound change in philosophy, policies and management approaches over the last forty years. The traditional topdown approach to nature protection has been widely criticized for failing to include critical social elements in management practices, and is being gradually replaced by a slew of participatory strategies under the rubric of bottomup conservation. The new approach recognizes local communities as key partners in wildlife management and seeks their participation in social development and biodiversity conservation. However, every social context is different in its structure and functions, and in the way social groups respond to calls for participation. In order to gain a better understanding of the approach and the barriers encountered in its implementation, a questionnaire survey of 188 households was employed in the communities of the Upper Mustang extension of Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) in Nepal. The study provides a comparative analysis of community participation and its barriers between Non-Tourist (NT) and Tourist (TV) villages. The results revealed important differences between the two groups in terms of their participation in community programs, barriers to participation, and perception of benefits from participation. Owing to their distinct spatial, demographic and attitudinal differences, the two village groups have their own sets of needs, values and motivation factors which cannot be generalized and treated as such. The research clearly identifies the need for the conservation agency to be creative in devising strategies and initiatives appropriate to specific social groups so as to optimize their input in participatory conservation.

Zagros forests cover 6.07 million ha and support rich plant and animal diversity. Changes in local community social and economic systems and the inefficiency of traditional forest management led to a critical situation in the stability of forest regeneration in recent decades. Due to a shortage of productive and arable lands and resulting unemployment and poverty, people overexploited the Zagros forests. Outside intervention in traditional forest management creates conflicts between local peoples and forest management organizations. To achieve sustainable forest management, including forest resources conservation and improvement of natural resource based livelihoods of communities, it is desirable to implement Forestry Incentive Programs (FIP) based on the important functions of forests. Detailed information on the socio- economics of communities, the effect of forests on local livelihoods, and lists of products extracted from the forest were obtained from a survey of local communities though questionnaire, interview and observation. We studied 276 households in three villages and completed 76 questionnaires by householders in the quantitative analysis. Sampling was performed by simple random sampling (SRS). The needs of rural communities, such as livestock husbandry, mainly arise from the characteristics and environmental features of villages. We identified the driving forces, pressures, status, impacts and responses (DPSIR) to design incentive programs, by DPSIR analysis and interaction analysis. Evaluation of local community benefits from forests showed that in order to improve forest management, 319 dollars per year would be needed by each family as an incentive in 2010 to prevent lopping and firewood collecting, the main causes of forest degradation.

A literature review was undertaken to unravel the historic drivers behind the formation of this protected area. Key informant interviews and questionnaire surveys were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of current governance approaches adopted by the park management authorities. Community-based questionnaire surveys and key-informant interviews focused on local communities' knowledge and awareness of the objectives of the park, people's role in decision-making, social characteristics, and resource use structures. The information from these surveys was evaluated within the context of good governance and sustainability of park management. Results show a lack of awareness and a low level of participation in protected area management, but a high degree of willingness in the communities to participate in conservation activities. An analysis of the survey data suggests that the park authorities enforce strict protection measures within the park, but this approach lacks a strong vision of sustainability. The surveys reveal that the local people have a very strong sense of belonging to the place and are willing to contribute to the protection of the PA. A large majority of the respondents rely on electronic media as their main source of information, which could potentially form the best medium for conservation campaigning in the region. With these findings in mind, we propose changes to the current governance model for effective and sustainable management of the park in the future. 2010 International Mountain Society.","journal":"Mountain Research and Development","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The central idea of these new initiatives, commonly launched under the umbrella of the term 'Social Forestry' (SF), has been 'people's participation' in the regeneration and management of forest. Protagonists claim that SF has opened a new vista for popular involvement in forestry activities, which was hitherto treated as a monopoly of the government technocrats. By deploying a conceptual framework, this paper probes into the performance of Social Forestry as a participative strategy in the context of South Asia. It concludes that, albeit the widespread popularity and advocacy, the role of Social Forestry in ensuring participation and in empowering the local populace has been insignificant and marginal. Participation in Social Forestry, in the present form, is yet another style of bureaucratic manipulation, where people are 'invited' to 'act' within the strict limits and guidance of central authority.","journal":"Journal of Rural Development","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This open-ended questionnaire study found that these limitations still persist among government forestry officials engaged in community forestry in Bangladesh. A majority of foresters questioned believed that community forestry was just another strategy to protect forest reserves from encroachment; local people could receive benefits from community forestry but were not competent to take part in planning decisions; land used for community forestry should remain under government control; the main roles of foresters are to protect forests or produce revenue for government; and local people are the chief cause of deforestation. These views predominated among more senior foresters, but junior foresters, and those with a more modest upbringing, believed that community forestry should meet local needs; farmers could participate in planning projects; foresters should increase mass awareness of forestry among the general public; and policy failures and ineffective administration also contributed to deforestation. A majority of farmers questioned thought that the forest department took an authoritative or formal attitude toward them and gave them infrequent technical support for community forestry. Until present arrangements are changed, public participation in community forestry is therefore simply an invitation to take part in a technically oriented and bureaucratically managed afforestation programme.","journal":"Journal of World Forest Resource Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

There is a system in place for fisheries or waterbodies, known as jalmohal administration. Under this system, the real control remains in the hands of the leaseholders. The evolution of wetland resource management approaches and their impact on actual harvesters are of particular interest in the study. By examining the implications of the top-down management regimes and the recent experimentation with the community-based resource management approach, this study analyses the trajectories of marginalization and consequential vulnerabilities of Hakaluki haor area local communities located in the northeastern region of Bangladesh. The framework of transfer of property rights, that is, leasing of wetlands as jalmohals (fishery estate), not only encourages individual gains and exploitations by the powerful elites, but also accelerates both the marginalization process and the vulnerability of local fishers to various types of shocks, including natural and health hazards.","journal":"Environmental Hazards-Human and Policy Dimensions","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

We analyzed the effects on livelihood capitals to compare in two ways: (1) before and after participation, and (2) participants and non-participants. In Cox's Bazar, there were some significant changes regarding income sources, but annual income was little changed after participation in participatory forestry. Literacy (about 10Â % after participation) and mobile phone ownership (75Â %) were significantly higher than before. Housing conditions were better (brick walls: 7.5Â %; sun-grass roof: 70Â %) than those of non-participants (brick walls: 0Â %; sun-grass roof: 77.5Â %). PF ensured legal rights on forest lands for participants, while non-participants were illegally living on public forestland. However, expenses were considerably higher than income; people were still struggling with poverty and many of them suffered from malnutrition. This ultimately put pressure on all capital. People had redistributed their available capital to cope with adversity, and there was a trend toward involvement in economic activities other than forests. Our study found that social capital was more influenced by PF more than other capitals. Due to the involvement with the PF program, people were feeling much more secure, women had elevated status, and social relationships became stronger.

The findings of these studies have been useful in guiding the policy interventions. Many factors affect conservation attitudes positively or negatively. The factors inspiring positive attitudes are likely to enhance the conservation objectives while those inducing negative attitudes may detrimentally undermine these objectives. The magnitude of the resultant effects of each particular factor is determined by the historical, political, ecological, socio-cultural and economic conditions and this may call for different management interventions. In this study we examined how conservation attitudes in western Serengeti are shaped by the following factors: level of conflicts with protected areas; wildlife imposed constraints (inadequate pasture, water, diseases, loss of livestock during migration, theft and depredation); participation in the community based project; and socio-demographic factors (age, education level, wealth, immigration, gender and household size). The results indicated that the level of conflicts, participation in the community based project, inadequate pasture, lack of water, diseases, wealth and education were important in shaping peoples' attitudes. However, in a stepwise linear regression analysis, 59% of the variation in peoples' attitudes was explained by three variables i.e., conflict level with protected areas, lack of water and participation in the community based project. In addition to these variables, level of education also contributed in explaining 51% of the variation in people's attitude regarding the status of the game reserves. Five variables (lack of water, level of education, inadequate pasture, participation in the community based project and diseases) explained 12% of the variation in people's attitude towards Serengeti National Park.

Villagers, foresters, park employees, entrepreneurs and environmentalists were surveyed. The survey applied a multi-group social choice method, following six steps: (i) identification of all relevant social states for sustainable forest management; (ii) elicitation of preferences, for different social states, of forest user groups' members; (iii) determination of attributes of users and social states; (iv) aggregation of individual forest value preferences into social value preferences; (v) inter-group comparison of preferences; and (vi) estimation of predictors of social forest value preferences. A distinction is made between the household-perspective and the citizen-perspective of evaluations. As well, socio-economic and institutional-legal attributes of stakeholders were tested as predictors of stakeholder preferences. The major findings include the following. First, non-consumptive forest uses, including ecosystem services, were given highest priority by all stakeholders. Second, consumptive values were weighted more discriminately, while non-consumptive values were viewed more holistically. Third, forest dependence and environmental-resource-entitlements lead to more household consumption-based valuations; whereas, the appreciation of diverse forest values increases with the education of people. Fourth, the stakeholders exercise higher consensus on the importance of non-consumptive uses when such values are evaluated in the context of societal needs but not as household needs; consumptive uses registered the opposite effect. This finding signifies the separation between individual-conscience and social-conscience corresponding with the evaluation of consumer needs and societal needs, respectively. Thus, societal allocations, such as biodiversity conservation or ecosystem services, must be based on valuations specifically formulated in the context of eliciting collective social judgments.

African elephants are taken as an example illustrating different attitudes to conservation. It is proposed that, rather than developing further the present common conservation attitude of 'wildlife apartheid', the future of elephants in many parts of Africa may rest on bringing them closer to the voters where the welfare of neither the human nor elephant is compromised.

This indicated significant contribution of NTFPs to local community income and livelihood resilience and thus, incentive for sustainable forest management. While access to NTFP is important to guarantee the socio-economic well being of the forest adjacent communities, their sustainable management has not been taken seriously by local government officials and policy makers thereby contributing to reduction of biodiversity resources and irretrievable loss of most species.

A randomly distributed questionnaire indicated that 94% of fishers believed that without the MIMP, there would be overfishing, dynamite use, destroyed habitats, and few fish. Fishers were more positive about core zones (no-take fishery closures) than general use zones (areas allowing selective fishing) as a consequence of increases in fishing pressure. Those that reported increased catches and sizes of fish since the creation of the MIMP were more likely to agree with present zone locations and more positive in general about fisheries and conservation planning. Most thought that fish size and gear restrictions were preferable to permanent closures. Perceptions differed among communities and gear users. Community and gear type explained 46% of the variance in responses about the perception that fisheries and conservation are compatible goals. Somewhat surprisingly, these effects were more important than catch increases or involvement in MIMP-related activities. The differences in perception between communities may be partly attributed to different fishing histories. Multiple-use zoning provides a means to identify and resolve conflicts and achieve what are likely universal objectives for fisheries sustainability and conservation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Concerns surrounding the promotion of national and international conservation agendas at the expense of local livelihood needs have generated interest in community conservation projects that attempt to include local participation and knowledge in natural resource management. The early excitement associated with community conservation has waned in light of recent assessments that it has been unsuccessful in meeting its ecological and social goals. This parallels other research that suggests communities are understood in generic or homogenous ways that influence how these initiatives are understood. Using a case study of the Mahushe Shongwe Game Reserve, this paper evaluates how rural households access environmental and economic resources to produce livelihoods, and how these access patterns impact their views of the project. It is argued that there are significant livelihood variations within the community that shape the ways households engage with, and benefit from, conservation planning. Rather than strictly viewing Mahushe Shongwe as a constraint to environmental resource access or site for limited employment, community members identify a number of benefits from its existence including education and development opportunities. Additionally, transformations in governance systems in the region impact community views of the project since younger residents are less likely to engage with the Matsamo Tribal Authority, which participates in managing the reserve. The consequence is that conservation has various impacts and meanings within a specific community that remain tied to the livelihood and governance systems being renegotiated in the post-apartheid era.

This paper uses a case study of the Mahushe Shongwe Game Reserve in South Africa to examine the key variables shaping community perceptions of community conservation. We employ multinomial logistic regression models to understand views of the benefits and future direction of the reserve. These models are coupled with information collected from semi-structured interviews that assists in providing a detailed, and more complex, understanding of the diverse ways that community conservation is perceived by local residents. The paper demonstrates that multiple factors, particularly household history, education, and gender contribute in shaping views of the reserve. While these variables are often identified in the academic literature as important, we argue that the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods helps reveal the interplay between them in shaping perceptions of community conservation.

This paper reports a number of community initiatives aimed at improving or providing alternative livelihoods, while at the same time conserving or restoring the integrity of the ecosystem on which the community depends. It present case studies of Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE (Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) and Akwesasne in northeastern North America, as well as examples from northern Canada, of communities that have attempted to integrate economic development, community values/culture, and the restoration of ecosystem and community health. In both the north and the south these communities face ecological pressures such as climate change, industrial pollution, loss of diversity and productivity, deforestation, and resulting loss of traditional livelihood strategies. They are also victims of global economic forces, economic and institutional globalization, and are struggling to make adaptive responses. Common themes are identified across the case studies and we identify the need for indicators and programs that recognize and reinforce the interconnections and guide development programs that integrate community and ecosystem health and sustainability.","journal":"Ecosystem Health","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

This, in association with cooperative organization, has brought high economic returns to fishers. Tourism development on the caye has created a new market for lobsters, which has motivated some fishers to harvest undersized, prereproductive lobsters to sell to local restaurants. Data from interviews and observations suggest that this local system of resource management may be threatened, because of a local market for lobsters which has emerged with the growth of tourism at Caye Caulker. These unsustainable practices, coupled with an underfunded, understaffed, and in the fishers' experience, usually uncooperative Fisheries Department makes enforcement of state-level fisheries laws next to impossible. Caye Caulker fishers face challenging questions concerning how they will practice in and perceive the fishery, which includes participation with and perception of Belize's Fishery Department.

M.","year":2011,"title":"Climate change in Oceania - A synthesis of biodiversity impacts and adaptations","dAbstract":"Climate change is already affecting many of the world's ecosystems with far-reaching impacts. In this special issue, contributors focus on the current and projected impacts of climate change across different geographical regions of Oceania (Australia, Pacific Islands and New Zealand). In this synthesis, we examine how climate change is affecting the three main realms: terrestrial, freshwater (broadly including estuarine and inland saline systems) and marine. Within this context, we also examine general strategies for climate adaptation including reducing other threats (e.g., habitat loss and degradation), expanding protected areas, increasing connectivity, restoring habitat and translocations. We show that many of these general strategies will not overcome all the threats caused by climate change and specific solutions are likely to be necessary. Beyond the implementation of these strategies, there are significant future challenges which will hamper effective adaptation that need to be overcome by the scientific community. Our current understanding of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity remains poor; this is particularly true for poor nations in the region. There is also considerable uncertainty in forecasts of climate change, particularly at the local scale, and this uncertainty impacts pro-active planning. This makes effective implementation particularly challenging. Considerable focus is needed into ecosystem-based adaptation where local communities are integrally involved, allied with more active and accountable management of conservation, through adaptive management processes. The world is experiencing far reaching and long-term changes to ecosystems with major impacts on human communities, particularly in relation to ecosystem services. Our ability to develop effective adaptation strategies from the broad scale policy (e.g., emissions control) to local scale management (e.g., building resilience in ecosystems) will be significantly tested but the world is in an important period and scientists and practitioners need to keep trying different approaches and reporting their successes and failures to the wider community.","journal":"Pacific Conservation Biology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

By elucidating the role of the state and its relationship to local institutions, one can better understand contemporary institutional conflict and the need to create mechanisms for inter-institutional cooperation in environmental decision making, particularly in the realm of protected area management. The article is based on findings from one of the remaining few Afro-tropical rainforests. Located in western Kenya, Kakamega forest is under immense threat of survival. The forest is located in a densely populated area and inhabited by poor farming communities, largely of Luhya descent. The study analyses varied notions related to local people's perception of institutional regimes. The aim of the article is to shed more light on what is meant by institutions, institutionalism and point to some common misleading notions associated with the terms; explain the institutional dimensions of environmental decision making in the context of shifting discourses in protected area management; explain the most common basis of institutional conflict over the environment and summarize by drawing emphasis on how comanagement in protected reserves requires the recognition of local institutional rights and how this can both reduce institutional conflict to achieve a sustainable relationship between societies and the environment.","journal":"International Journal of Rural Management","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Kiss, A.","year":2004,"title":"Is community-based ecotourism a good use of biodiversity conservation funds?","dAbstract":"Community-based ecotourism (CBET) has become a popular tool for biodiversity conservation, based on the principle that biodiversity must pay for itself by generating economic benefits, particularly for local people. There are many examples of projects that produce revenues for local communities and improve local attitudes towards conservation, but the contribution of CBET to conservation and local economic development is limited by factors such as the small areas and few people involved, limited earnings, weak linkages between biodiversity gains and commercial success, and the competitive and specialized nature of the tourism industry. Many CBET projects cited as success stories actually involve little change in existing local land and resource-use practices, provide only a modest supplement to local livelihoods, and remain dependent on external support for long periods, if not indefinitely. Investment in CBET might be justified in cases where such small changes and benefits can yield significant conservation and social benefits, although it must still be recognized as requiring a long term funding commitment. Here, I aim to identify conditions under which CBET is, and is not, likely to be effective, efficient and sustainable compared with alternative approaches for conserving biodiversity. I also highlight the need for better data and more rigorous analysis of both conservation and economic impacts.","journal":"Trends in Ecology and Evolution","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

A case study of a communally owned forest reserve in Costa Rica shows how the CPPA model identifies various stakeholders and their roles, rights and responsibilities.

The study on utilization of medicinal plants for meeting heath care needs was carried out between March 2001 and March 2002 in New Dabaga Ulongambi Forest Reserve, Tanzania. The study aimed at generating necessary data for the Udzungwa Mountains Forest Management project to draft sound Joint Forest Management plans. Specific objectives of the study among others were to assess knowledge associated with utilization of medicinal plants for health care needs as well as factors associated in using plant medicines in the study area. A questionnaire survey, market survey and literature review were used to collect information. Tools used for data analysis were Statistical Packages for Social Science and content analysis. A total of 45 plant species were documented curing about 22 human diseases. Medicinal plants were readily available throughout the year and plentiful in the forest reserve. Roots and leaves were the plant parts harvested for medicinal purposes. Processing of plant medicines involved boiling, pounding, soaking in water and chewing. Distance to health facility, income level of the household and beliefs contributed to the use of plant medicines. The study concluded that medicinal plants play an important role in providing primary health care to the rural communities. It is recommended that in achieving joint forest management (JFM), villagers adjacent to the forest reserve should be sensitised on the importance of JFM through seminars, workshops, drama, school songs or video show. During the development of a joint draft management plan, villagers as an informal institution must define their priority needs of use of parts of the forest in collaboration with the Udzungwa Mountains Forest Management project.

In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the valuation by international ecotourists and local respondents of the perceived benefits of the Mabira Central Forest Reserve. The factors that influenced respondents' valuation of forest conservation were also investigated. Describing a hypothetical scenario to elicit respondents' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for forest conservation was the central part of the questionnaire. The WTP;income ratio was used to estimate respondents' perceived value of forest conservation. A chi-square (Ï‡2) test indicated significant association between respondent category (local and tourist) and categories of perceived benefits (p-value = 0.001). The locals were more interested in direct-use values while the tourists showed greater interest in the indirect-use values. A Student's t-test showed that the WTP:income ratios of the locals were much higher than for the ecotourists (p-value &lt; 0.001). This implies that the local communities had a higher valuation of forest conservation than the ecotourists. Regression analysis revealed that all other factors being constant, the WTP of respondents who perceived direct- and indirect-use value as the most important forest benefit was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those who perceived no value by $5.8693 and $0.02628, respectively. The respondents who rated the contribution of the ecotourism project to community development as moderate had a significantly higher WTP compared to those who rated it as low by $6.6908. Overall, these results indicate that the benefits people derive from the forest either through direct or indirect uses influence valuation of forest conservation. Results also indicate that although ecotourismrelated benefits improved attitudes towards forest conservation, ecotourism alone may not be an adequate conservation tool because of the limited support it can provide to the local community.

This paper found that despite the potential of community forest management, the community based policy initiatives in Bangladesh fail to address the dynamic relationships among the formal and informal institutions that largely shape the rights and access of forest communities to forest resources. These polities ignored the social construction process that generated inequality and marginalisation in gaining access to forest resources. This paper argues that various forms of institutional arrangements and their relationships are of central importance in determining which social actors gain access to and control over their local natural resources. This, in turn, contributes to the forest communities' limited ability to ensure their livelihoods, their basic needs and their capacity to cope with adverse events such as climate induced hazards.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

A case study analysis","dAbstract":"By the late 1980s, ecotourism became officially recognised as a sustainable development strategy, and a way to improve the quality of life of marginalised communities. Yet today it is still a field of contested discourses and paradigms, especially in developing countries, where environmental legislation is still often ambiguous and not powerful enough to ensure enforcement of the outcomes of planning and assessment instruments. It has been argued that impact assessment procedures are not only meant to identify potential impacts of a proposed development, but should endorse responsible environmental management practices, and active community involvement in the decision-making process. This study compares the theory and practice behind ecotourism assessment and management of the La Escobilla Turtle Sanctuary and the Xixim Ecolodge through the analysis of initial project impact assessments, semi-structured interviews with representatives of different sectors of Mexican society, and a survey of tour operators. It aims to determine whether or not current Mexican environmental legislation for assessment procedures is providing an adequate framework for the adoption of sustainable tourism practices. It is argued that impact assessment procedures often poorly incorporate social and cultural variables, and hence fail to acknowledge tour operators' management and operation skills, and therefore decrease the quality of impact prediction and monitoring strategies for future ecotourism management.

This paper analyses participation in four communities benefiting from payments for biodiversity and carbon fixation in Mexico, and contrasts the results for each case with neighbouring communities that do not receive payments. We take a holistic approach that accounts for procedural rules, actors' interactions, institutions and values, and individuals' characteristics. We show that the nature of PES rules and the effectiveness of communication with government officers and NGOs influence resource managers' ability and willingness to participate. We highlight community size, resource managers' ability to diversify livelihood activities and local perspectives on the conservation of common forests, particularly sacred values and intergenerational concerns on forest conservation, as critical participation drivers. This analysis provides insights on why and how these new institutions may be attractive for some resource managers and permits to draw some recommendations for the future design of PES projects and programmes.

A third view is to consider participation as a mechanism of governance that enhances the State's adaptiveness to social changes. In forest policy, participation was introduced in connection with the International debate on sustainability as a means for taking on board social considerations in policy formulation. Conflicting visions of forest management, together with competing demands on forests as between community vs. conventional timber production needs create specific challenges for participatory processes in forest management and governance. The importance of social sustainability of decisions relating to forest management determines the types and modes of participation in different cultural, economic and political contexts. The governance perspective, based on mechanisms rather than norms, promotes the establishment of actors' networks or partnerships. Some of these new configurations consolidate the positions of the more powerful stakeholders, while others, on the contrary, promote greater equity by redistributing power between participants.","journal":"La participation des acteurs et le partenariat, comme approche et finalitÃ© de la gestion publioue et locale des forÃªts","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Uncontrolled hunting and other human-induced declines in diversity and abundance of seed-dispersing animal species might also negatively affect biomass carbon storage, which could undermine climate change mitigation efforts. We study how the Ecuadorian Socio Bosque conservation incentive programme [Programa Socio Bosque-PSB] addresses animal species conservation and engages with local communities. Drawing on official documents, as well as interviews and observations in four indigenous communities that participate in PSB, we discuss the role of local participation in conservation monitoring. The PSB's incentive and control approach has to some extent supported the establishment and financing of forest monitoring systems in indigenous communities. However, we argue that PSB in its current design exerts a conservation gap because it does not include animal species diversity and abundance as important components for successful long-term forest conservation. Supporting a bottom-up participatory monitoring methodology for locally-based conservation action can increase the existing positive conservation attitudes among community members. We provide specific examples of how animal species conservation and participatory monitoring can be combined and carried out. Â© 2013 Copyright 2013 The Author(s).

To clarify the status of this Critically Endangered subpopulation we carried out a series of surveys from early 1999 until mid 2002 on abundance, habitat use, population dynamics and threats. Our estimates of total population size were 33-55 dolphins (95% confidence limits 31-76) based on direct counts, strip-transect analysis, and Petersen and Jolly-Seber mark-recapture analyses of photo-identified individuals. Mean minimum annual birth and mortality rates were similar, i.e. 13.6 and 11.4%, and no changes in abundance &gt;8% were detected over 2.5 years. Dolphins died mainly from entanglement in gill-nets (73% of deaths). The dolphins' main habitat includes confluence areas between the main river and tributaries or lakes. Dolphins make intensive daily use of these confluences, moving up and downstream over an average length of 10 km of river and within a 1.1 km 2 area. These areas are also important fishing grounds and subject to intensive motorized boat traffic. Sixty-four percent of deaths (1995-2001) with known location (n = 36) occurred in these areas. Interviews with local residents revealed a generally positive attitude towards the establishment of protected areas for this subpopulation. Because of the dolphins' dependence on areas that are also used intensively by people, primary conservation strategies should be to increase local awareness and introduce alternative fishing techniques.

International development agencies now recognize the need to preserve natural resources and biodiversity in concert with improving human well-being; likewise, conservation agencies acknowledge that parks cannot be protected over the long term without the consent and support of local inhabitants. Nonetheless, of 36 integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) reviewed by us and others, only 5 demonstrate that they have positively contributed to the conservation of wildlife. In this paper we promote ecological monitoring to (1) evaluate the ICDP paradigm and specific ICDPs, (2) provide feedback to guide the future course of ICDPs, and (3) integrate information relevant to both conservation and development. Few ICDPs have included ecological monitoring programs to date, although several have plans to monitor in the future. We outline a flexible blueprint for ecological monitoring of ICDPs and provide an example from our ongoing work in Madagascar. To establish comprehensive ecological monitoring programs, we recommend that two types of monitoring be carried out at multiple levels of ecological organization and across diverse taxa. First, monitoring programs should assess the total effects of ICDPs on biodiversity and on overall ecosystem health by tracking indicator assemblages across space and through time (biodiversity monitoring). Second, ICDPs should monitor the resources and ecological processes that will be directly affected by changes in human activities due to implementation of ICDPs by comparing target species diversity and abundance in unregulated areas, managed buffer zones, and core protected areas through time (impact monitoring). Comprehensive ecological monitoring is critical in shaping ICDP management plans and in furthering the integration of conservation and development.","journal":"Conservation Biology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Located in the picturesque state of Sikkim in the eastern Indian Himalayan Region with snow-clad mountain peaks, numerous glaciers, a snow- and glacier-fed stream network and high-altitude lakes, this biosphere reserve (BR) is named after the world's third highest mountain peak, Mt Khangchendzonga (8598 m), 1 of the 14 peaks in the world above 8000 m. The KBR covers an area of 2619.92 km 2, 36.92% of the land area of Sikkim (Figure 1). BRs exemplify participatory sustainable resource use and ecosystem conservation. It is therefore important to consider the human dimensions of a BR from the outset and to survey stakeholders' attitudes about conservation in order to take into account the inherent traditional dependence of people on forest-based resources. Potential future conflicts of interest need to be addressed through well-thought out strategies and integration of traditional conflict prevention mechanisms.

A partnership between scientists, educators, and local administrators on an evaluation program has been developed to evaluate a model of education program evaluation that includes short-and long-term evaluation of (1) knowledge and attitude change, (2) behavior change, and (3) positive biological impact. Previous work has shown short-term knowledge retention from this education program.

The reserves' RCI (0.20 to 0.40) resulted in fair (9 reserves) and poor (2 reserves) conditions as indicated by 64 to 68% of non-living and 32 to 36% of living slope substrate, CI of 0.15 to 0.54, CCI of 0.15 to 0.49, and fish biomass of 1.8 to 19.6 t km(-2). One reserve with the highest ecological ranking was determined as a local monitoring station to educate local fishers and farmers. For other marine reserves with high ecological conditions and located outer of Leyte Gulf, the farming of Eucheuma sp., Holothuria sp. and Pinctada sp. were suggested. While, rearing of Haliotis sp., Siganus sp., or Scylla sp. in mangrove-friendly aquaculture systems, rice farming and eco-tourism were suggested for low ranking reserves. The potential benefits of these livelihoods and the success in conserving the marine resources may enhance the quality of life of the coastal populace if there is a strong multi-sectoral cooperation.","journal":"Aquaculture International","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

Nevertheless, labor migration and tourism increasingly help to diversify the sources of income for farm and pastoral households. The most important component of water demand in the Draa basin is crop production in the oases of the Middle Draa valley, which would be impossible without the extensive use of irrigation schemes. Agronomic and economic options for irrigation water management are analyzed and simulated. From an agronomic perspective, specific emphasis is put on problems of temporal water scarcity and on problems with increasing salinization of soils as a consequence of irrigation water use and groundwater mining. Using a hydro-economic simulation model, the consequences of long-term trends in the volatility of water supply are simulated. Land use, by contrast, is dominated by extensive pastoral-nomadic production. The physical biomass productivity of extensive pasture under Climate Change is simulated using a locally adapted version of the SAVANNA-Model. This spatially explicit, process-orientated model simulates spatial animal dynamics based on the distribution of biomass productivity. In addition, we look into the resilience mechanisms of pastoral-nomadic range management in the wider Draa region. Pastoralists' mobility in the region allows for the use of and creates reliable fodder resources, which are ecological buffers against environmental variability. Decisions also depend on socioeconomic resources and individual networks, which function as economic buffers.","journal":"","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Kumar, A.; Puri, S. K.","year":2004,"title":"People's participation in joint forest management: Empowerment of communities or protection of forests?","dAbstract":"The increasing degradation of forest resources has led to a change of strategy in the forestry sector. The National Forest Policy, 1988 and Joint Forest Management (JFM) arrangements sought to reverse the past management policies and practices by acknowledging the claim of local communities on forest produce and associating them with forest management. However, the JFM framework, despite its revisions, devolves little in terms of rights and powers to the communities. This paper analyses the JFM framework against the scope and extent of change in three critical parameters: â€¢ the empowerment of communities, â€¢ the redefinition of the role of state forest departments and â€¢ the participation of local communities. The conclusions are that: â€¢ In the forestry sector, the empowerment of communities has been very limited in scope and extent; this has been exacerbated by a failure to redefine their property rights to match the changing economic and social realities, â€¢ the redefinition of the role of state forest departments also has been limited; the departments have failed to redefine the objects of forest management in line with the needs of the communities or to support the empowerment of the communities, and â€¢ the participation of local communities has been limited by failure to take cognizance of the views of rural communities and institutions, motivate and reward them. The judgement is that the JFM guidelines have placed the participation of local communities towards the mobilization rather than the empowerment end of the spectrum of its interpretation.

Incentives for different groups to participate have been argued by many to be desirable characteristics to promote participation. A key challenge for government and donor agencies is to develop better understanding of the incentives for different groups to be able to achieve and sustain their participation. Based on a case study of a joint forest management (JFM) programme in the northern state of Haryana in India, this paper highlights the relevance of understanding people's perception of the incentives. It specifically examines three hypotheses related to perceptions of villagers about incentives offered under the JFM programme and relates them to their participation in joint management. It concludes that a better understanding is likely to help in improving project implementation at the local level and the design of participatory forest management programmes more generally.","journal":"International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

The framework highlights ecological character as a social construct and, with the notion of wetlands as settings for human well-being, builds a concept for assessing the inter-linkages between ecosystem services and livelihoods. The value and broader applicability of our framework is then tested by applying it to a case study from India (Lake Chilika) to evaluate the degree to which the mutual goals of improving both human well-being and the ecological character of wetlands have been achieved. The case study maps changes in human well-being induced in the basin communities due to external vulnerability contexts, institutions and freedoms.

Structural equation modeling is used, and variations in incongruity are explored across the four states and the two management levels. We construe organizational bureaucracy comprising of hierarchical rigidity, centralization of powers, non-participatory decision making, and organizational rigidity, and acceptability of CBFM being composed of structural acceptability, cultural acceptability, and organizational support. The analyses reveal variation in the degree of incongruity across the states - highest in HP, lowest in WB, and in middle for AP and HR - but no variation across management levels. The loadings of four conceptual components of organizational bureaucracy are invariant across the four states, but the loadings of three components of acceptability of CBFM systems vary. Organizational structure has the highest influence on acceptability of CBFM systems in HP and the lowest in WB; support mechanisms have an almost uniform impact in WB, HR and HP states, and lowest impact in AP; and organizational culture has the highest impact in HR and HP, lower impact in AP, and no impact in WB. These differences suggest that the uniform organizational reforms, across states, pursued by the Government of India may prove counter productive. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The fishery is based on introduced fish species that are not native to the lake. The lake ecosystem is very fragile, as reflected in its fluctuating fish catches. The fishery almost completely collapsed in 2001, due partly to mismanagement and ignorance about needed conservation measures. The Kenyan government, like many governments around the world, recognized the need to involve fishers and other stakeholders, in order to ensure better management of the lake fisheries resources. Also referred to as collaborative management (co-management), this management approach provides the opportunity to share responsibility for managing the fishery resources between the government and the community. A total ban on fishing was imposed in February 2001, lasting for 1 year, to allow lake fish stocks to recover. This study analyses the co-management process for Lake Naivasha, and discusses the role played by the community during the fishing ban, as well as the successes and challenges encountered, and the tribulations and perceptions of the fishers regarding the new management strategy. It also comprises the first documentation of community participation in fisheries management begun for Lake Naivasha in the year 2001. Â© 2010 The Authors.

Economic valuation is conducted by measuring the human welfare gains or losses that result from changes in the provision of ecosystem services. Bats have long been postulated to play important roles in arthropod suppression, seed dispersal, and pollination; however, only recently have these ecosystem services begun to be thoroughly evaluated. Here, we review the available literature on the ecological and economic impact of ecosystem services provided by bats. We describe dietary preferences, foraging behaviors, adaptations, and phylogenetic histories of insectivorous, frugivorous, and nectarivorous bats worldwide in the context of their respective ecosystem services. For each trophic ensemble, we discuss the consequences of these ecological interactions on both natural and agricultural systems. Throughout this review, we highlight the research needed to fully determine the ecosystem services in question. Finally, we provide a comprehensive overview of economic valuation of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, few studies estimating the economic value of ecosystem services provided by bats have been conducted to date; however, we outline a framework that could be used in future studies to more fully address this question. Consumptive goods provided by bats, such as food and guano, are often exchanged in markets where the market price indicates an economic value. Nonmarket valuation methods can be used to estimate the economic value of nonconsumptive services, including inputs to agricultural production and recreational activities. Information on the ecological and economic value of ecosystem services provided by bats can be used to inform decisions regarding where and when to protect or restore bat populations and associated habitats, as well as to improve public perception of bats.","journal":"Book Section","included":false,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":true}

An assessment of livelihood and environmental outcomes of nontimber forest product trade in Asia, Africa, and Latin America","dAbstract":"This article addresses the question, to what extent and under which conditions nontimber forest product (NTFP) trade leads to both livelihood improvement and forest conservation. We based the analysis on a standardized expert-judgment assessment of the livelihood and environmental outcomes of 55 cases of NTFP trade from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The results show that NTFP trade benefits several components of peoples' livelihoods, but may increase inequality between households. Involvement of women in the production-to-consumption system (PCS) tends to have a positive impact on intrahousehold equity. In 80% of the cases, the commercial production of NTFPs does not enable people to make financial investments to increase quality and quantity of production, limiting the potential for development. In our set of cases, commercial extraction from the wild, without further management, tends to lead to resource depletion. NTFP production systems are generally considered to have lower environmental values than natural forest, but do contribute positively to the environmental values in the landscape. We found that higher livelihood outcomes are associated with lower environmental outcomes and conclude that NTFP trade is not likely to reconcile development and conservation of natural forest.","journal":"Ecology and Society","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

With a view to providing evidence for the hypothesised link between exploitation and conservation/development in the non-timber forest product (NTFP) debate, it evaluates the feasibility of using the commercial exploitation of buho (Schizostachyum lumampao) as a strategy for conserving the rain forest. An analytical framework is used to assess whether the principal conditions of sustainable extraction - ecological sustainability, economic feasibility and political and social acceptability - are being fulfilled. The authors conclude that, despite the lack of possibilities for adding value, the lack of organisation and the illegality of extraction, buho gathering in the study village is economically feasible as an ancillary activity. Moreover, the regenerative capacity of the plant is such that buho extraction itself does not cause the depletion of the resource, as long as immature poles are not cut. The authors argue, however, that the sustainability of buho extraction - as of any other non-timber forest product - cannot be judged on the basis of the features of the extractive economy alone. The extraction of buho does not affect agricultural expansion or migration to the forest frontier, which are the main causes of deforestation and depletion of buho resources in the study area. Only in relatively stable situations, where forest resources are not under pressure, may buho extraction offer opportunities to improve peoples' livelihoods and sustain forest conservation. In such instances, the authors recommend the organisation of gatherers into cooperatives and the demarcation of protected extraction areas.","journal":"Journal of Bamboo and Rattan","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

It uses case study surveys of residents and managers in Belek, Antalya, Turkey. Differences in attitudes across seven main areas are investigated, including the positive and negative economic outcomes of tourism; positive and negative sociocultural impacts; negative environmental impacts; views on further tourism development, and benefits and problems related to forested land close to destinations. The results reveal that some attitudes are held in common - especially positive attitudes including tourism's benefits in creating jobs and income. Differences were mostly observed not in the direction but in the strength of opinion. The most significant differences were found in managers' beliefs that tourism's environmental and social impacts were few, while residents were extremely negative about those impacts. Differences of attitudes on the future use of forestland headed the list of all differences between managers and residents. Divergent loyalties were revealed. Managers supported their business and employers; local people supported their local area. The need for further research, including the role of perhaps distant \"moral stakeholders\", and for more comprehensive understanding, and more sustainable outcomes, are highlighted.

Ninety members of local communities bordering Manyeleti Game Reserve, which is contiguous with Kruger National Park, South Africa were interviewed. Respondents expressed diverging attitudes toward predators, which were more favorable among participants with higher education. Negative views were particularly due to fear of human and livestock losses, especially to lions, Panthera leo. Lions were thought to be the most abundant predator both within and outside the reserve. Lions were also the best known predator and were most often held responsible for killing livestock. Despite these livestock losses and a lack of conservation education, most participants voiced favorable opinions about large carnivore conservation, as predators were considered an integral part of the respondents' natural heritage. Thanks to this cultural tolerance and also because of a largely accepted management policy regarding predator control, large carnivores and people can coexist in the vicinity of Kruger National Park.

Community attitude and intention toward four dimensions of ecotourism, including conservation of natural resources, preservation of cultural tradition, sustainable community development, and participation in ecotourism planning and management, were measured. Furthermore, the paper examines whether or not there is congruence between community attitude and intention toward ecotourism development. Analysis is based on data collected using face-to-face questionnaire interviews in two indigenous communities consisting primarily of the Paiwan ethnic group. The study findings show that local people hold generally positive views of the measures necessary to achieve ecotourism; however, their intentions to engage in behaviors to support these measures do not entirely match with their positive views. This suggests that while local residents may support ecotourism development based on international guidelines, their intentions to act will depend on local environmental, social, and politico-economic conditions. It is suggested that issues related to community empowerment, relationship between government and communities, value conflicts introduced by ecotourism development, and the dynamics among and between various community groups will need to be addressed if positive community intention to participate in ecotourism is to be encouraged.

Land compensation is widely practiced and it is a crucial part of contemporary people-centred conservation resettlement strategies. In this article, using the case of the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in Nepal, I argue that policy-makers' belief that the social impacts of dislocation can be properly mitigated by economic-focused resettlement programmes alone is a myth. They have ignored the close relationships between place, social networks and livelihoods. A study of a displaced indigenous community known as Rana Tharus in far-western Nepal shows that a strong sense of nostalgia and homesickness is evident in this community. Displaced Ranas continue to idealise their old abode as 'paradise on Earth' while experiencing their new home as only promoting poverty, helplessness and danger. Their anger is due to the fact that they no longer have the mutual help or support from their neighbours as they once did in their old abode. From the Ranas' point of view, the old land had both high economic and social value. The study demonstrates that the act of displacement is a violent disruption of a community's daily social contacts. The destruction of the Ranas' social networks has not only led to their dispossession and threatened their livelihoods, but has also made them vulnerable, because these traditional social webs provided important alternative livelihoods in a rural economy. As a consequence, it has further reinforced their sense of nostalgia. The cultural and social meanings of land must be obtained prior to implementing any resettlement policies. The study indicates that if displacement is truly unavoidable for conserving biodiversity, more comprehensive rehabilitation resettlement policies than those that currently exist are needed.

Moreover, overharvesting of timber through the conflict period has endangered community livelihoods and raised concerns regarding resource sustainability from international conservation organizations. Since the end of conflict in 2003, the Liberian government has forged international partnerships to create a reformed policy framework balancing commercial, conservation and community (the three Cs) interests. In an effort to contribute to the larger body of work on the role of natural resource management institutions in the creation and fostering of the resource curse, this paper offers a case study of timber in Liberia. We feel that an in-depth understanding of the Liberian case clarifi es the challenge of timber as an extractive commodity and how the institutional framework can be shaped to provide a positive contribution to economic development. The discussion focuses on the historical development of Liberian land and forest tenure institutions that lead to poverty, ecological degradation and conflict. Tracing the more recent implementation of the three Cs, this paper analyzes the current conditions of community engagement and outlines critical steps to be taken for Liberia to escape further resource driven cycles of conflict.

Finally, the paper makes some recommendations in institutional analysis of forest property rights, such as strong and clearly defined property rights, integration of formal and informal rights and suggests strong linkage between institutional property rights and sustainable livelihoods as a \"panacea\" for sustainable forest livelihoods and management in developing countries.

This paper attempts to assess the existing practices, people's perception, gaps and ways forward for participatory urban forestry and aims to help promote UF through identifying the current status, future prospects for and peoples' perception about UF in two cities of Nepal. The study was conducted in Pokhara sub-metropolitan city and Bharatpur municipality of Nepal. Total numbers of plants in the effective green spaces are estimated as 285,500 in Pokhara and 213,250 in Bharatpur, and the number of tree species was 62 and 52 respectively. The religious tree species - . Ficus bengalensis and . Ficus religiosa are the most common and hazardous in both cities. The urban people have preferred small, less branchy and attractive tree species. However, the choice of existing species is inappropriate and not according to the people's interest. Therefore, urban people are unsatisfied with the existing species and their frequencies. The municipal authorities and other related organizations do not have any specific plan, programs and activities nor is there any public involvement to promote urban forestry. Regular coordination, cooperation and monitoring are required for the involvement of various stakeholders such as municipality, government office, community organizations and urban people. Analysis further shows that people's perception on urban forestry is encouraging as most of them agreed that the urban forests are useful for addressing the challenging urban environment. Adequate institutions and financial resources coupled with effective cooperation and coordination among concerned organizations could ameliorate the urban environment as urban community forestry.

While growing demands for water can be met in part by increasing the efficiency of irrigation schemes, by damming rivers, or by mining groundwater, all have financial or ecological implications. In northern Cameroon farmers produce two seasons of sorghum crop using only one rainy season and no irrigation by planting seasonally adapted varieties. Babouri is a wet season variety, picked at the end of the rainy season and Mouskouari is deep-rooted variety, planted in dry season when water is contained deep below the soil surface. This technique is appropriate for many African countries where the climatic conditions and soils are similar. Agriculture is necessary for food security in Africa, however Africa must carefully select suitable sites for irrigation construction, choose appropriate technologies and optimise the use of both new and indigenous, often low-cost approaches to mobilising water to improve crop production. Recovering and promoting traditional agricultural techniques such as dry season sorghum production can help to increase yield, conserve wetland biodiversity and utilise less water. It is also important to document and disseminate all techniques which help to minimise water use and to bare in mind that crop production is not the only way to reach food security. Cattle grazing, fisheries and the sale of Non, Timber Forest Products (NTFP) and wetlands products can contribute towards welfare and hence food security.

The objective of the paper is to meta-analyze four categories of community relationships from different reports of studies on CBNRM. Ninety-five studies were reviewed and coded for meta-analysis of community relationships in the following categories: (1) Relationships of community with specific natural resource. The studies reflect two sets of beliefs: one is the interrelatedness of humans, nature and the supernatural; the other is belief in mastery of nature and utility of natural resources. (2) Relationships among community members. The themes are categorized into community attachment and cohesion, formal organization of community members and empowerment. (3) Relationships between community and non-government organizations (NGOs). The issues addressed in this category are organizational development, dependency-autonomy and networks. (4) Relationships between community and government agency/local government unit (GA/LGU). The themes are on policy and power relations, incentives and co-management.

Claims that market mechanisms can encourage environmental protection and promote greater economic efficiency while saving taxpayers' money are tantalizing. In the forestry sector, policy makers are widely heeding this advice and shrinking command-and-control systems in favour of incentive mechanisms that seek to align private enthusiasm with the public good. In some cases, governments are even promoting the creation of markets where none existed before. In others, markets are evolving of their own accord. In such times of change, it is difficult to stand back and take stock. Yet, it is during such times that guidance is most needed. In the rush to introduce market-based solutions to environmental problems, a particular concern is how markets are impacting on the poor. In this paper an effort is made to draw on a recent review of markets for four forest environmental services (biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, watershed protection and landscape beauty) to draw out preliminary insights into how markets are performing with respect to their impacts on the poor. The evidence suggests a need for caution. While the potential benefits are significant, the poor face an uphill battle in realizing them. Key constraints facing the poor include a lack of property rights over forest resources and their environmental services; inadequate skills and education; poor market information; lack of market contacts; inadequate communication infrastructure; inappropriate contract design; and lack of access to financial resources. To tackle these, four potential ways forward are highlighted: (1) assign property rights to forest assets and their related environmental services in ways that respect customary arrangements and poor people's tenure; (2) strengthen capacity for market participation, e.g. through training and education; (3) invest in the provision of market information, advice and, essentially, a contact point for buyers and sellers, perhaps through the establishment of a 'market support centre'; and (4) improve access to finance so that poor individuals can make necessary up-front investments in market participation.","journal":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","included":true,"abstractReview":false,"unresolved":false}

L.","year":2000,"title":"Institutional arrangements for fisheries: Alternate structures and impediments to change","dAbstract":"The precarious state of many of the world's important commercial fisheries have called into question the ability of government agencies to carry out mandates related to stock conservation and sustainability. This paper argues that the prominent role of government agencies in building fisheries management systems of the past few decades, has led to the prevalent situation that management is top-down and has fostered the view that these institutions are 'in control'. In that view, the fishing sector has generally been excluded from management and is depicted as fundamentally irresponsible with regard to resource sustainability. A paternal government-industry relationship diminishes the opportunity for the fishing industry to become a responsible partner in fisheries management. We argue that institutional arrangements are a major impediment to effective management change. We consider the problem of managing commercial fisheries under current institutional structures by examining the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as a case study. We outline the benefits of alternative bottom-up and participative decision making for fisheries and discuss the requirements for more effective institutional arrangements that would empower stakeholders toward building a real stakeholders-government partnership.

We focus on two important dimensions that have been neglected in approaches to product stewardship to date. Firstly, we argue that immanent within the basic concept of stewardship is a problematisation of dominant understandings of property ownership in neoliberal market economies. In the space opened up by notions of stewardship, different ways of enacting both rights and responsibilities to products and materials emerge which have potential to advance the sustainability of material economies. Secondly, through exploration of existing expressions of product stewardship, we uncover a neglected scale of action. Both policy and dominant articulations of EM focus primarily on the efficiency of production processes; and secondarily, the attitudes and behaviours of individual consumers. Missing from this is the 'meso-scale' of social collectives including households, neighbourhoods, more distributed communities and small scale social enterprises. Based on a review of existing research from Australia and the UK, including our own, we argue that understanding of embedded practices of material responsibility at the household scale can both reinvigorate the concept of product stewardship as a potentially radical intervention, and reveal the potential of the meso-scale as a challenging but worthwhile realm of policy intervention.

{"author":"Lange, B.; Gouldson, A.","year":2010,"title":"Trust-based environmental regulation","dAbstract":"Within this paper, we examine the contribution that trust-based relationships can make to achieving better - and particularly more effective, efficient and equitable - environmental regulation. While levels of trust in regulators, regulatory processes and outcomes are often discussed, the influence of trust on different actors and on different measures of regulatory performance is poorly understood. Within this paper, we define trust-based environmental regulation as a specific regulatory style that involves openness and cooperation in interaction between regulated, regulators and third-party stakeholders in order to achieve environmental protection objectives. We then discuss the pros and cons of trust relationships between regulators, regulated businesses and citizens for achieving behavioural change towards greater environmental protection. To illustrate the significance of these issues, we then examine three forms of contractual regulatory style where trust relationships are critically important: responsive regulation, self-regulation and environmental agreements. Based on this analysis, we highlight the importance of trust-based relationships, and we argue that one of the greatest contributions of trust-based environmental regulation is to challenge how we think about regulation. Trust is often understood as enabling existing regulatory relationships or in the case of self-regulation as a complement to regulation. However, we argue that the real potential of trust is to open up new ways for participants in regulatory regimes to engage in collective action, to go beyond a perception of regulation as driven by the competing interests of individual actors, and thus, to open up new channels of influence for behavioural change towards greater environmental protection. Our analysis therefore has great relevance for future research and for on-going debates on the future of regulation.

Several studies have attempted to measure total national wealth or changes in wealth, but have been seriously hampered by a lack of data, especially for natural and human capital. To address this problem, the UN and other international statistical agencies developed a standardized framework for environmental accounts, the System of integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA). Using the newly available asset accounts for natural capital, national wealth accounts are constructed and used to assess the contrasting development paths of Botswana and Namibia. Botswana, with an explicit policy of reinvestment of resource rents, has roughly tripled per capita wealth and national income over the past two decades. Namibia, with no explicit policy to use natural capita to build wealth, has seen per capita wealth and income decline.","journal":"Environmental and Resource Economics","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

{"author":"Langergraber, G.","year":2013,"title":"Are constructed treatment wetlands sustainable sanitation solutions?","dAbstract":"The main objective of sanitation systems is to protect and promote human health by providing a clean environment and breaking the cycle of disease. In order to be sustainable, a sanitation system has to be not only economically viable, socially acceptable and technically and institutionally appropriate, but it should also protect the environment and the natural resources. 'Resources-oriented sanitation' describes the approach in which human excreta and water from households are recognized as resource made available for reuse. Nowadays, 'resources-oriented sanitation' is understood in the same way as 'ecological sanitation'. For resources-oriented sanitation systems to be truly sustainable they have to comply with the definition of sustainable sanitation as given by the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA, www.susana.org). Constructed treatment wetlands meet the basic criteria of sustainable sanitation systems by preventing diseases, protecting the environment, and being an affordable, acceptable, and simple technology. Additionally, constructed treatment wetlands produce treated wastewater of high quality, which is fostering reuse, which in turn makes them applicable in resources-oriented sanitation systems. The paper discusses the features that make constructed treatment wetlands a suitable solution in sustainable resourcesoriented sanitation systems, the importance of system thinking for sustainability, as well as key factors for sustainable implementation of constructed wetland systems.

Within 20 years, it is expected that an additional 2 billion will live in towns and cities, mainly in developing countries, demanding sanitation. Still over 90% of sewage in developing countries is discharged untreated, polluting rivers, lakes and coastal areas. Conventional sanitation concepts, based on flush toilets, a water wasting technology, are neither an ecological nor economical solution in both industrialized and developing countries. The water-based sewage systems were designed and built on the premises that human excreta are a waste; suitable only for disposal and that the environment is capable of assimilating this waste. A sanitation system that provides Ecological Sanitation (EcoSan) is a cycle-a sustainable, closed-loop system, which closes the gap between sanitation and agriculture. The EcoSan approach is resource minded and represents a holistic concept towards ecologically and economically sound sanitation. The underlying aim is to close (local) nutrient and water cycles with as less expenditure on material and energy as possible to contribute to a sustainable development. Human excreta are treated as a resource and are usually processed on-site and then treated off-site. The nutrients contained in excreta are then recycled by using them, e.g., in agriculture. EcoSan is a systemic approach and an attitude; single technologies are only means to an end and may range from near-natural wastewater treatment techniques to compost toilets, simple household installations to complex, mainly decentralised systems. These technologies are not ecological per se but only in relation to the observed environment. They are picked from the whole range of available conventional, modern and traditional technical options, combining them to EcoSan systems. The paper presents an introduction to EcoSan principles and concepts including re-use aspects (available nutrients and occurring risks), and case studies of EcoSan concepts in both industrialized and developing countries.

{"author":"Langeweg, F.","year":1998,"title":"The implementation of Agenda 21 'our common failure'?","dAbstract":"Sustainable development has for a long time been considered the starting-point for environmental policy, with Agenda 21 leading the way to such development. Social and economic equity, as well as global efficiency and development, are considered among the requirements for sustainable development. Only when such development is reached, will the solution to environmental problems come into perspective. Although we are now 5 years along the road marked out by Agenda 21, the perspectives for achieving the objectives stated are still slight. Despite economic growth, global inequity is on the increase. The conversion of natural areas to agricultural land will greatly increase due to the population growth, especially in Asia and Africa. In North America and Europe this trend seems reversed: life expectancy is longer and people's health has improved. The developing world is catching up. However, there is more needed to bring the world population's welfare and social security levels up to par. At the same time the environmental pressures on the world's natural areas will have to be brought down substantially. This can be done using market-based instruments, supplemented where necessary with orders, bans, fiscal measures and agreements at national and international levels. Internationally, a policy directed to investments and trade is needed to stimulate developing regions to undertake technological renewal and work away backlogs. The technological potential is still gigantic, but investment in the social system - in other words, in people - will be necessary if we are actually to use this potential.","journal":"Science of the Total Environment","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Researchers have examined the measurement of resilience in ecosystems and in social-ecological systems, and the comparative vulnerability of social groups. Our paper refocuses attention on the processes and relations that create social resilience. Our central proposition is that the creation of social resilience is linked to a community's ability to access critical resources. We explore this proposition through an analysis of how community resilience to the stress of water scarcity is influenced by historically contingent mechanisms to gain, control, and maintain access to water. Access is defined broadly as the ability of a community to actually benefit from a resource, and includes a wider range of relations than those derived from property rights alone. We provide a framework for assessing the construction of social resilience and use it to examine, first, the different processes and relations that enabled four communities in northern California to acquire access to water, and second, how access contributed to their differential levels of resilience to potential water scarcity. Legal water rights are extremely difficult to alter, and given the variety of mechanisms that can generate access, our study suggests that strengthening and diversifying a range of structural and relational mechanisms to access water can enhance a community's resilience to water scarcity.

To assist vulnerable rural households improve their food security, the British Department for International Development implemented a seed relief program from 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 that emphasized recycling of maize open pollinated varieties (OPV). Using data collected from 597 households in six districts in 2006, this study assesses the effectiveness of the program in terms of its targeting of beneficiaries, the flow of information from participating NGOs to beneficiaries on the need to recycle the seeds, and the level of recycling done at the end of the program. The empirical results suggest that the targeting method participating NGOs use inadvertently excludes relatively vulnerable households while including large proportions of relatively well-endowed households in the program. The choice of varieties to distribute is guided more by the ecological adaptability of available commercial seeds and less by preferences of beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the fact that seed selection information is critical in encouraging beneficiaries to recycle distributed seed, not all of them received it. In conclusion, it may be stated that the program undoubtedly contributed to increased food productivity by vulnerable households but its overall effectiveness could have been enhanced through (i) the involvement of the beneficiaries in the choice of types of seed to be distributed, (ii) better targeting of beneficiaries, and (iii) improved information flow between NGOs and beneficiaries.

Decades of conflict in the region have affected livelihood strategies of local people and caused enormous population displacements, all of which have had impacts on the natural environment and protected area management. Conservationists working to protect and effectively manage natural resources and protected areas have much to learn from the experience of humanitarian and relief organizations working in conflict situations. In addition, relief and development organizations can learn from some of the approaches applied by conservation agencies. In this paper, lessons from the experience of the humanitarian sector are analyzed and their value for conservation organizations working amidst political and armed crisis is examined. This analysis draws upon the experience of the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) in the DRC and Rwanda from 1991 to date.

The floodplain carries a diverse economy and ecology which is supported by flood events that once occured naturally but are now regulated by an upstream dam. PRESPA modelled the eco-hydrology which underpins various ecosystem services to determine how this might be managed to alleviate poverty. A model was used to quantify the economic value of the available water, especially the value accruing to the poor. This model linked to three development scenarios to explore trade-offs and outcomes of (1) a status quo, 'unstructured' economy; (2) a structured diverse economy; and (3) a structured 'single sector' agricultural economy. This model gives decision makers ameasure of where water is best used in terms of poverty alleviation and enables them to examine future economic and ecosystem trajectories. In summary, poor households on the floodplain currently have a diversity of income and food sources, making them less vulnerable to economic and climatic shocks, while there is a trend towards intensive agriculture which may deliver higher returns but with greater costs and increased vulnerability.

Recent writings on social capital's role in facilitating community conservation efforts have highlighted the ways in which strong levels of this asset can produce positive conservation outcomes.

Drawing on ethnographic and survey work from the Cayos Cochinos Marine Protected.

It shows that tourism income captured locally improves rural households' livelihoods and generates linkages in the local economy. On the job learning, training sessions and extensive support by non-governmental organisations and donors are further shown to empower rural actors and unlock socioeconomic opportunities for the future. In this context, CBTEs can be characterised as pro-poor initiatives. However, this article provides counter evidence that the sustainability of such community tourism ventures is to be questioned. First, mainstreaming these projects within the competitive tourism commodity chain proves highly challenging and costly; second, communities' institutional and managerial capacity is weak and thus CBTEs' viability is limited; finally, inadequate support by donors and non-governmental organisations fails to tackle challenges faced by community tourism ventures.

Building on an institutional analysis as well as an applied sustainable livelihoods approach, it is argued that the Grootberg lodge partnership contributes to nature conservation, poverty alleviation as well as capacitybuilding and empowerment at both the individual and collective levels (the triple bottom line). Indeed, empirical data gathered in 2006 and 2007 show that the Grootberg lodge has helped to improve the livelihoods of some rural households by distributing to them secure wage revenues, building their financial and physical assets and reducing their vulnerability; it has further provided employees with essential training sessions (human capital) and has involved community members in some of the tourism management decisions. These results, however, remain context related and dependent on some important unpredictable and intangible variables (trust and openness); as a result, further systematic livelihood studies in other contexts are called for in order to better inform policy-makers on the future promotion and development of tourism partnerships both in Namibia and worldwide.

To the water supply and sanitation service providers, it refers specifically to septage management. The MDGs and the 2008 International Year of Sanitation inspired all of us to reduce poverty by increasing access to sanitation, interpreted largely as increasing access to safe toilets. Today, the emerging definition of sanitation in the Philippines points to the hygienic and proper management, collection, disposal/reuse of human excreta (feces and urine) and domestic wastewater to safeguard the health of individuals and communities. This new definition resonates well with the new science of sustainable sanitation being promoted by a global expert group called the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance. The SuSanA defines sustainable sanitation as systems that protect and promote human health, do not contribute to environmental degradation and/or depletion of the resource base, and are technically and institutionally appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable.

From the political aspect, nature is a product of the society. Its form is a result of interaction driven by human in the area of nature as well as society where human or nature wellbeing is less important.

Uncovering and assessing assumptions regarding Central Himalayan medicinal plant conservation","dAbstract":"The trade in medicinal plants for herbal remedies is large and probably increasing. The trade has attracted the attention of scientists and development planners interested in the impact on plant populations and the potential to improve rural livelihoods through community based management and conservation. This has resulted in a large number of publications and development activities, ranging from small NGO projects to new government policies. Through a review of 119 references from Nepal, 4 common assumptions regarding the medicinal plant collection and trade have been identified: I. The commercial medicinal plant resource base is becoming ever more degraded as a consequence of collection; II. The medicinal plants are an open-access resource; III. Cultivation can contribute to conservation of commercially collected medicinal plant species; and IV. Medicinal plant harvesters are cheated by middlemen. The frequency of the assumptions is documented, their empirical support is evaluated, and the consequences of their presence for conservation and rural livelihoods are discussed. It is concluded that the empirical backing for the assumptions is weak, and that some reviewed references use logically flawed argumentation. It is argued that the assumptions are leading to misguided conservation efforts, and an inclusive approach to conservation of commercial central Himalayan medicinal plant species is briefly outlined.

These initiatives include local deliberative processes of low-carbon futures as well as local-global interactions in 'eco-innovation jam' dialogues carried out in a virtual space, but founded on communicating with local stakeholder groups. Experiences from national processes and international examples of these structured dialogues of community engagement raise important questions of environmental justice and deliberative processes that facilitate participation by some groups, but perhaps also neglect others. This is particularly relevant since the environmental justice discourse traditionally frames environmental concerns in a place-bound manner that includes local responses to environmental questions. In this paper we argue the importance of local and global forums and deliberative processes for community engagement in order to incorporate stakeholders' perceptions of future options for low-carbon living, travelling and consuming services and products. Important policy transformations in planning for low-carbon societies are outlined and results from cases are discussed. We conclude with three remarks about the importance of citizen participation for understanding local conditions for change, processes of localized internationalization, and new roles for nation states facing the climate change challenge. We also recognise the importance of the local and global level of deliberative processes targeting sustainable urban futures.

In this paper, we contribute to this movement regarding the conception of stakeholder agency within social-ecological systems. We examine primary evidence from the governance of post-disaster recovery and disaster risk reduction efforts in Thailand's coastal tourism-dependent communities following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Through an emerging storyline from stakeholders, we construct a new framework for conceptualising stakeholder agency in social-ecological systems, which positions the notion of resilience within a conception of governance as a negotiated normative process. We conclude that if resilience theory is proposed as the preferred approach by which disaster risk reduction is framed and implemented, it needs to acknowledge much more explicitly the role of stakeholder agency and the processes through which legitimate visions of resilience are generated.

Understanding Processes of Forest Tenure Reform","dAbstract":"This article reports on findings from a research project, in more than 30 sites in 10 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, aimed at analyzing cases where changes in formal tenure rights for forest-based communities had recently occurred or were in process. Though by far largest proportion of the world's forests are owned by the state, over a quarter of forests in developing countries are now owned by or assigned to communities. This suggests, at least in some ways, a marked departure from the historic trend towards centralizing. The project, led by the Center for International Forestry Research in coordination with the Rights and Resources Initiative in 20062008, sought to identify issues and concerns from the perspective of socially and economically vulnerable groups that were seeking rights reforms. The objectives were to understand reform processes, particularly the extent to which community rights had improved in practice. This article reports on the analysis of three aspects of the reforms: the broad global trends shaping them, challenges in implementation and outcomes for livelihoods and forests.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

This article, based on data from research in 2005 in Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, presents a working conceptual model for analyzing these interactions. The research found that vulnerability increased when decentralization was not combined with policies addressing structural inequities-that is, increased municipal government control over land and forests must be accompanied by policies increasing poor local people's access rights and security. At the same time, increased municipal government authority over forest management and monitoring can facilitate access to these and other assets needed for forest livelihoods, but this new responsibility must also be accompanied by improved controls over local authorities. The needed changes rarely come about without specific organized demands of local actors' associations and movements.

However, successful implementation of natural resources management decisions on the ground is a complex task, which requires a comprehensive understanding of a system's social and ecological linkages. This paper investigates the relationship between sense of place and people's attitudes towards their natural environment. Sense of place contributes towards shaping peoples' beliefs, values and commitments. Here, we set out to explore how these theoretical contributions can be operationalized for natural resources management planning in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia. We hypothesise that the region's diverse range of natural resources, conservation values and management pressures might be reflected in people's attachment to place. To tests this proposition, variables capturing socio-demographics, personal wellbeing and a potential for sense of place were collected via mail-out survey of 372 residents of the region, and tested for relationships using multivariate regression and redundancy orientation analyses. Results indicate that place of residence within the region, involvement in community activities, country of birth and the length of time respondents lived in the region are important determinants of the values assigned to factors related to the natural environment. This type of information is readily available from National Census and thus could be incorporated into the planning of community engagement strategies early in the natural resources management planning process. A better understanding of the characteristics that allow sense of place meanings to develop can facilitate a better understanding of people's perceptions towards environmental and biodiversity issues. We suggest that the insights gained from this study can benefit environmental decision making and planning in the Great Barrier Reef region; and that sense of place is a concept worthy of further investigation elsewhere.

As a result, demand for resources required for farming, such as feed, seed, and clean water, has increased substantially. This study focuses on semiintensive shrimp culture as practiced on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. We estimate the spatial ecosystem support that is required to produce the food inputs, nursery areas, and clean water to the shrimp farms, as well as to process wastes. We also made an estimate of the natural and human-made resources necessary to run a typical semiintensive shrimp farm. The results show that a semiintensive shrimp farm needs a spatial ecosystem support - the ecological footprint - that is 35-190 times larger than the surface area of the farm. A typical such shrimp farm appropriates about 295 J of ecological work for each joule of edible shrimp protein produced. The corresponding figure for industrial energy is 40:1. More than 80% of the ecological primary production required to feed the shrimps is derived from external ecosystems. In 1990 an area of 874-2300 km2 of mangrove was required to supply shrimp postlarvae to the farms in Colombia, corresponding to a total area equivalent to about 20-50% of the country's total mangrove area. The results were compared with similar estimates for other food production systems, particularly aquacultural ones. The comparison indicates that shrimp farming ranks as one of the most resource-intensive food production systems, characterizing it as an ecologically unsustainable throughput system. Based on the results, we discuss local, national, and regional appropriation of ecological support by the semiintensive shrimp farms. Suggestions are made for how shrimp farming could be transformed into a food production system that is less environmentally degrading and less dependent on external support areas.","journal":"Environmental Management","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Education is realized to be a mean of enhancing human capacity. Consequently, there is a great demand for education in all aspects of development. Education is an important instrument for the development of individual and societies. It should be used to promote peace, justice, understanding, tolerance and equality for the benefit of present and future generations. Education is a core element of society; In other words, education is a major concern for all societies, the foundation and essential driving force of economic, social, and human development and is at the heart of the change in the areas of science, technology, economics, and culture. Agricultural education for sustainable development in the third millennium is not only option, but this is essential and sensitive process. Nowadays the majority of the world countries, especially developing countries such as Iran, face to environmental problems. Also every damage on natural resources and environment influences on food security. In this relation, agricultural education institutions with diffusion modern technologies in the relation of conservation natural resources and environment, can play important role in this context, so that we can say that agricultural education for sustainable development is safe investment because education in general and agricultural education in particular are essential and important for sustainable development from three aspects: food security, social constancy and support from environment for present and future generations. Iran's economic growth hinges on the development and promotion of a vibrant and sustainable agricultural production base. The prime movers for sustainable agricultural production include: availability of improved technologies, human capital, sustainable growth of biological and natural resource capital, improvement in performance of supporting institutions and favorable economic policy environment. Central to making these components operational is the production of suitable graduates, who are (i) technologically competent and relevant, ii) equipped with the necessary \"soft skills\"and business skills and (iii) able to work with local and especially rural communities. In this paper we review the current weaknesses in the tertiary agricultural education system and propose the necessary changes to be instituted. To turn the continent around, tertiary agricultural education must be transformed. Issues of faculty retention, institutional management, curricula content and education delivery, urgently require review and redesigning. We demonstrate the \"best practices\"which if replicated on a wide scale can move the continent in the desired direction. Using systematic approach, revision in structure and programs of agricultural education institutions in order to conservation of environment, consideration to environmental problems and finally education of agricultural instructors are the most important results of this paper.","journal":"","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Limitations of basic resources (water and soil) and population growth have been the cause of these environmental problems that countries are confronted with. Developing countries have numerous problems, including destruction of forests, vegetable and animal species, and pollution of the environment. Damage to natural resources and the environment can influence the food-security situation. One of the main millennium development goals (MDGs) is protection of the environment and people's health. This cannot obtained unless there is ensured food security. Food security has been defined as a situation when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food needed to maintain a healthy and active life. At the same time, with ensured food security, we can hope to protect the natural resources and environment. The methodology used is descriptive-analytical, and its main purpose is determining the importance and role of food-security solutions in the reduction of environmental hazards and improvement of natural resources and the environmental situation in developing countries. Therefore, some of the most important food-security solutions that can play an important role in this relation were discussed, including conventional research-based technology, biotechnology, information and communication technologies (ICTs), alternative energy sources, and food irradiation.","journal":"Book Section","included":true,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Despite the past 50 years of progress in addressing environmental damage in the United States and elsewhere, intractable problems have arisen that to date have eluded successful technological or policy responses. Solutions have been sought by recognizing that these problems are very complex and demand interdisciplinary approaches that require building effective partnerships among relevant academic institutions, governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and private business, as well as levering various disciplines and traditional knowledge systems. Such thinking has evolved to now consider humans to be an integral part of nature, which is captured in the idea of the 'human ecosystem', where biophysical, socioeconomic, and cultural systems interact via a complex set of organizational, spatial, and temporal 'couplings'. Within such a context, environmental problems can be viewed as coupled human and natural systems, which afford unique and novel approaches to their solutions. This paper discusses the development of the coupled systems approach as a scientific methodology, reviews its key characteristics and principles, provides an example of how it has been applied to assess conservation issues in alpine areas of Northwest Yunnan Province, China, and recommends how this scientific approach might be further developed for use in mountainous landscape regions of Central Asia and elsewhere.

A significant barrier to the development of effective and sustainable adaptive strategies for climate change in such places is the gap between risk and perceived risk. This study looks at a vulnerable location in Fiji-the densely populated Rewa River Delta where environmental changes resulting from shoreline retreat and floods are expected to increase over the next few decades and entail profound societal disruption. The numbers of people living in the Rewa Delta who know of climate change and could correctly identify its contributory causes are few although many rank its current manifestations (floods, riverbank erosion, groundwater salinization) as among their most serious environmental challenges. While lack of awareness is a barrier to adaptation, there are also cultural impediments to this such as short-term planning perspectives, spiritual beliefs, traditional governance structures. One way forward is to empower community leaders in places like the Rewa Delta to make appropriate decisions and for regional governments to continue working together to find solutions that acknowledge the variation in sub-regional trans-national vulnerability to climate change.

Needless to say, India should be concerned about climate change since this phenomenon might have substantial adverse impacts. And these impacts are likely to be on agriculture, sea level rise leading to submergence of coastal areas, as well as increased frequency of extreme events. India being a large developing country with nearly two-thirds of the population depending directly on the climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and forests, needs to take stock of the situation perhaps more than any other country. The projected climate change under various scenarios is likely to have implications on food production, water supply, biodiversity and livelihoods. Thus, India has a significant stake in scientific advancement as well as an international understanding to promote mitigation and adaptation. This requires improved scientific understanding, capacity building, networking and broad consultation processes. But the primary steps that need to be taken are those related to creating awareness amongst Indians about the gravity of the issue at hand. Many Indians do not even realize that they are directly related to this problem, and perceive that it is confined to the policy makers, researchers and corporations. Even young adults, including students and working professionals in India, particularly at the graduation and postgraduation levels are vaguely aware of the Climate Change talks doing the rounds globally. This study is an attempt to examine their awareness and attitude towards Climate Change. The results clearly indicate that the young adults do not have adequate interest and awareness about a serious issue like climate change. For India to tackle the challenge successfully there needs to be a National level awareness campaign across the country wherein each and every citizen is atleast aware of the happenings around him.","journal":"","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

However, this local context is being dramatically affected by changes introduced through globalization. This chapter explores rite different paths through which globalization is affecting local and indigenous communities and their traditional forest-related knowledge, and the potential for these communities to adapt to, or counteract, the impacts of globalization. We start with a reflexion on globalization and its links with local communities. Current globalization can be regarded as the most recent phase of a long-term process initiated by European expansion 500 years ago. Following a brief discussion of the positive effects and potential benefits of globalization on local communities, the remainder of :he chapter considers the more disquieting aspects of this topic. European countries provide examples of how globalization has affected local communities in capitalist industrial economies as well as under communism. We then address the long-lasting influence of European colonialism, and explore how local communities are still being affected by political ideas developed in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and introduced to the colonies, including centralized control of forests and their management. We continue with a focus on developing countries and the influence of environmental policies and the market economy as important facets of globalization's impact on local communities. This discussion includes an examination of the application of violence in the framework of a market economy. Finally, we discuss how local communities deal with globalization, as well as the importance of participation and consultation processes to support these communities.","journal":"Book Section","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Dramatic economic restructuring and social transformation have radically challenged the established structure of the welfare regime in Hong Kong. Like other East Asian economies significantly affected in the globalization era and in the midst of economic crises, Hong Kong can no longer guarantee high economic growth and low unemployment. Economic restructuring and social transformation have brought significant changes in post-industrial society. New social risks arising from increasing global and complex societies and a breakdown of traditional and informal risk-sharing mechanisms bring enormous difficulties for certain social groups. New social risks have engendered a growing demand for public services while there are only limited resources meeting the growing needs. It is widely recognized that global processes of economic change have significantly shaped national economic and social policies. Economic competitiveness gives national governments impetus to adopt a welfare pluralist approach and thus further exacerbates unequal access to public services. These policy reforms may further widen the gaps between the haves and the have-nots and contribute to a divided society. In a changing and globalizing economy of Hong Kong, the extent to which welfare restructuring attains productive employment and sustainable livelihoods and ensures equal opportunities for people's future development is the current focus of debate.

It is estimated that only a small portion, less than 4%, of all the organic solvents consumed in Hong Kong are collected as waste solvents and properly treated, while the remainder are used either in the formulation of solvent containing products, or are lost to the environment through vapour emissions, leaks and spills, or dumped illegally. It was found that solvent recycling has been a common practice in some industries but the existing level of solvent recycling in Hong Kong is difficult to estimate. About 87.4% of all the waste organic solvents disposed of at the licensed facilities are potentially recyclable although whether they can be recycled in practice depends on many factors. Examples of existing waste organic solvent management and recycling practices from selected industries in Hong Kong are presented. The economic feasibility of current and future potential recycling systems is evaluated for a few selected cases.

This article assesses these abilities among artisanal fishers in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands. In a comparison of two villages, it documents local resource users' abilities to monitor long-term ecological change occurring to seagrass meadows near their communities, their understandings of the drivers of change, and their conceptualizations of seagrass ecology. Local observations of ecological change are compared with historical aerial photography and IKONOS satellite images that show 56 years of actual changes in seagrass meadows from 1947 to 2003. Results suggest that villagers detect long-term changes in the spatial cover of rapidly expanding seagrass meadows. However, for seagrass meadows that showed no long-term expansion or contraction in spatial cover over one-third of respondents incorrectly assumed changes had occurred. Examples from a community-based management initiative designed around indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure governance show how local observations of ecological change shape marine resource use and practices which, in turn, can increase the management adaptability of indigenous or hybrid governance systems.

Although Simbo's population continues to depend on their own food production and small-scale governance regimes regulate access to resources, the island's way of life over the last century has increasingly been affected by processes associated with globalization. In this context of a rapidly globalizing world, this article examines the island's resilience and vulnerability to the tsunami and the adaptive capacities that enabled the response and recovery. The tsunami completely destroyed two villages and damaged fringing coral reefs, but casualties were low and social-ecological rebound relatively brisk. By combining social science methods (household surveys, focus group and ethnographic interviews) and underwater reef surveys we identify a number of countervailing challenges and opportunities presented by globalization that both nurture and suppress the island's resilience to high amplitude, low-frequency disturbances like tsunamis. Analysis suggests that certain adaptive capacities that sustain general system resilience come at the cost of more vulnerability to low-probability hazards. We discuss how communities undergoing increasingly complex processes of change must negotiate these kinds of trade-offs as they manage resilience at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the shifting dynamics of resilience may be critical for Pacific Island communities who seek to leverage globalization in their favor as they adapt to current social-ecological change and prepare for future large-scale ecological disturbances.

It is widely accepted that the poorest communities are the most vulnerable, because they lack access even to the most basic urban services placing them at a comparative disadvantage and challenging their capabilities to take on additional stresses caused by climate change. Such complex vulnerabilities require comprehensive responses that link climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts to the sustainable development of these communities enhancing their adaptive capacity. It is not sufficient to concentrate on either mitigation or adaptation, but a combination of these results in the most sustainable outcomes. Yet, these two strategies do not always complement each other, but can be counterproductive. A similar argument can be made for linking climate change adaptation with sustainable development. In order to avoid these conflicts, priorities need to be set. This calls for a methodology and comparison tool to assess the most cost-effective and appropriate strategies for each community. Strategies need to be evaluated in terms of their negative consequences and priority given to those that minimize these. This article includes case studies of successful adaptation and mitigation strategies suggesting that these successes be translated into local contexts and communalized with the involvement of local authorities using participatory approaches. Successful outcomes integrate different adaptation and mitigation strategies with the overall development goals of the community through local government leadership, comprehensive planning and prioritization.

We build upon a comparison of three cases that show inverse gradients of knowledge and perceptions of the environment and human pressure on natural resources. We discuss why the ecological dimension currently lags behind in the management of tropical forest landscapes and to what extent participatory development can enhance the fit among ecological, socio-cultural, and economic systems. For each case study, socio-cultural and anthropological aspects of society and indigenous knowledge of the environment, the distribution of natural resources, classification, and management are documented in parallel with biophysical studies. Our results confirm that the ecological dimension remains weakly addressed and difficult to integrate into development actions when dealing with tropical forested landscape management in developing countries. We discuss three issues to understand why this is so: the disdain for traditional ecological knowledge and practices, the antagonism between economy and ecology, and the mismatch between traditional and modern governance systems. Participatory development shows potential to enhance the fit among ecological, socio-cultural, and economic systems through two dimensions: the generation and sharing of information to understand trends and the generation of new coordination practices that allow stakeholders to voice environmental concerns. In the absence of a \"champion,\" institutions, and financial resources, the expected outcomes remain on paper, even when changes are negotiated. Future research in natural resource management must emphasize better integration at the interface of ecology and governance. Finally, we identify three challenges: the design of operational tools to reconcile ecology with social and economic concerns, the creation of governance systems to institutionalize collaborative and integrated resource management, and the design of enabler organizations close to local communities.

We found a lower fish income ratio in higher income quartiles, a small share of local non-fishery income, and an apparent lack of other livelihood opportunities within the rural economy. The majority of fishermen had positive perceptions of the non-market value of marine resources, agreed with the need for MPAs, and perceived positive potential income benefit from MPAs. Level of education and fishing income were consistent significant positive determinants of these perceptions. Policy implications suggest: involving likely-to-be-displaced reef fishers in the crafting of management plans; conducting intensive research on appropriate and feasible livelihood options, for example, marine culture technologies; and designing explicit strategies to increase the propensity of coastal households to invest in children's education as a strategy for long-term sustainability of resource management.

{"author":"Lavi, O. S.","year":2008,"title":"Corporate social responsibility: Marketing in the global world","dAbstract":"Corporate Responsibility is the commitment of business to contribute to sustainable economic development, working with employees, the local community and society at large to improve their quality of life. Thus environmental concerns are part of a company's corporate responsibility. The advantages to the organization which implements corporate responsibility are clear: That organization creates positive image, trust in the product or in marketing to the customer, authority and public. On the other hand, the disadvantages are high costs and changes in work procedures. Business involvement with community changed its shape and level during the years, managing activities such as money contribution to needed bodies, helping workers volunteering in the community, involvement in educational activities, and involvement in health and welfare activities. Changes in the global order brought the requirement for corporate responsibility to a new level. As multinational organizations expand their activities in different countries, the problems of cultural diversity and different management perceptions and different attitude to the firm's responsibility raise. In order to determine what is accepted ethically or morally, multinational companies must consider the implications of their decisions on a variety of stakeholders in the origin country as well as in the foreign countries in which they operate. Overall, the debate that should be taken place is over what does stand behind the actions that are taken by the organizations with the Corporate Responsibility. Which stakeholders are taking under account? Do organizations have the right to push their employees over the edge under the flag of keeping the environment? Do donations to the community or to the school system gives the organization the right to use dangerous materials or take over the environmental resources?

Training courses offered by various organizations, national institutes, universities and the private sector are aimed at providing graduates with skills in disease diagnostics using molecular methods, histopathology, epidemiology, immunology, as well as in disease prevention and control methods. Most training programmes either focus on diseases affecting specific commodities, such as shrimp, marine fish or molluscs, or on diagnostic methods for pathogens such as viruses. Because of the need to train a large pool of geographically dispersed participants, innovative and cost-effective ways of delivery like online and on-site training should be encouraged as well as workshops preceding or following meetings and symposia. One important aspect to be addressed is the translation of training materials to facilitate knowledge transfer to the farm level. Since the inadequate level of aquatic animal health expertise in the Asia-Pacific affects worldwide aquaculture, partnerships between governments, various international organizations and academia should be strengthened in order to fill the training gap.","journal":"Book Section","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Here, we use simple dynamic models of size-spectra to examine an alternative, so-called balanced harvesting. Balanced harvesting helps in retaining the approximate power-law size-structure of natural ecosystems, whereas size-at-entry regulations do not. Balanced harvesting is less likely to destabilize steady states than size-at-entry regulations set close to the size at maturation. Surprisingly, our numerical results suggest that steady-state biomass yield can be substantially increased by switching from size-at-entry to balanced harvesting. On the basis of these results, we argue that the goals of conservation and of greater yields seem less difficult to reconcile than have previously been thought. However, to work towards these goals require a change in our approach to fishing.

{"author":"Law, R.; Plank, M. J.; Kolding, J.","year":2012,"title":"On balanced exploitation of marine ecosystems: Results from dynamic size spectra","dAbstract":"Fisheries are often managed to protect small young fish and to harvest big old fish. This can be wasteful, leading to large parts of catches being discarded. A recent suggestion is that it could be better to distribute fishing more widely across species and body sizes, balancing it more closely to the natural productivity of different organisms. Here, we test effects of such fishing against more traditional methods using a model of a single fish species with a dynamic size spectrum together with a fixed spectrum of plankton. This has the feature that productivity is determined by the bookkeeping of biomass in the model, and decreases as fish grow larger. The results show that harvesting smaller fish (which have higher productivity) allows a greater sustainable biomass yield than harvesting larger fish (which have lower productivity); the greater spawning-stock biomass that comes from protecting large fish contributes to this. Balanced exploitation brings fishing mortality more in line with this natural variation in productivity. In addition, the resilience of the ecosystem to perturbations can be improved, and disruption to the size distribution of organisms in the ecosystem reduced. We argue that there are potentially real benefits to be gained by moving towards more balanced exploitation of marine ecosystems, unconventional though this is.

Methods for efficient, systematic reserve selection have generally been designed to maximize the protection of biodiversity while minimizing the costs of reserves. These techniques have not directly addressed the factors threatening species at specific sites. By incorporating measures of site vulnerability into reserve selection procedures, conservation planners can prioritize sites based on both representing biodiversity and the immediacy of factors threatening it. Here we develop two complementary approaches for identifying areas for conservation based on species composition and potential threats facing the species. These approaches build on two established methods of systematic reserve selection. The first approach involves mapping irreplaceability (a statistic derived from reserve selection theory that measures the potential importance of a site for protecting all species) and the degree to which the area is vulnerable to threats from three basic anthropogenic factors (the percentages of a site devoted to agriculture, to urban and suburban development, and to open mines). We classified areas with respect to both irreplaceability and the three indicators of vulnerability, producing a continuous ranking of all sites based on these factors. Our second approach was to incorporate site vulnerability into a reserve selection algorithm. This approach allowed us to locate those sets of sites that protected all species and were most likely to be threatened by human activities. These two analyses can provide regional-scale guidance for conservation in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, and they demonstrate two potential tools for solving complex conservation-planning problems.","journal":"Ecological Applications","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

The purpose of the studies was to analyse children's specific vulnerabilities to climate change that need to be taken into account in policy development. Scientific research indicates that existing vulnerabilities are likely to be exacerbated by continued climate change. Because children have unique perspectives of their environment, they can be important actors in enhancing community capacity to address climate-related risks. In the UNICEF research, children noted a range of experiences, ranging from livelihood insecurity in Mongolia to threats of sea level rising in the Pacific Islands to massive flooding of their neighbourhoods in the Philippines and crop failures in Indonesia. Involving children in the design of policy, and designing climate change policies with children's rights in mind, are essential to creating policies that do not have unintended negative consequences.

To inform this debate, we analyze the initial outcomes of those REDD+ projects that systematically report on their socio-economic dimensions. To categorize and compare projects, we develop a participation and benefits framework that considers REDD+'s effects on local populations' opportunities (jobs, income), security (of tenure and ecosystem services), and empowerment (participation in land use and development decisions). We find material benefits, in terms of jobs and income, to be, thus far, modest. On the other hand, we find that many projects are helping populations gain tenure rights. A majority of projects are obtaining local populations' free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). However, for those projects interacting with multiple populations, extent of participation and effects on forest access are often uneven. Our participation and benefits framework can be a useful tool for identifying the multi-faceted socio-economic impacts of REDD+, which are realized under different timescales. The framework and initial trends reported here can be used to build hypotheses for future REDD+ impact evaluations and contribute to evolving theories of incentive-based environmental policy.

Revisiting the natural capital/human-made capital substitutability debate","dAbstract":"This paper revisits the natural capital/human-made capital substitutability debate by putting forward a production function incorporating the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Use of this alternative production function shows that, where relevant, the elasticity of substitution between natural capital and human-made capital is less than one. Moreover, as attempts are made to increase the stock of human-made capital to offset the depletion of natural capital, the elasticity of substitution moves closer to zero. This suggests three things. First, even if one focuses entirely on resource availability and ignores the need for waste assimilative and life-support services, human-made capital cannot serve as a substitute for natural capital. Second, since a given quantity of real output requires an irreducible quantity of resource input, there is a need to maintain a minimum stock of resource-providing natural capital. Third, natural resource policy and national income measurements should be based on a strong rather than weak sustainability stance.","journal":"International Journal of Global Environmental Issues","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

As such, the scale of economic systems must remain within the limits imposed by the need to preserve critical ecosystems and the regenerative and waste assimilative capacities of the ecosphere. These limits are determined by biophysical criteria, yet macroeconomics involves the use of economic instruments designed to meet economic criteria that have no capacity to achieve biophysically based targets. Macroeconomic policy cannot, therefore, directly solve the biodiversity erosion crisis. Nevertheless, good macroeconomic policy is still important given that bad macroeconomy policy is likely to reduce human well-being and increase the likelihood of social upheaval that could undermine conservation efforts.

{"author":"Lawn, P.","year":2013,"title":"The failure of the ISEW and GPI to fully account for changes in human-health capital - A methodological shortcoming not a theoretical weakness","dAbstract":"Andrew Brennan (Ecological Economics, 2013 this issue) has argued that the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) are theoretically flawed because, as indicators designed to capture the net psychic income generated by economic activity, they fail to incorporate net changes in human-health capital. To a lesser extent, Brennan is also critical of the fact that the ISEW and GPI are unable to reflect both economic welfare and sustainability. Whilst I'm happy to concede that the two indicators fail to fully account for changes in human-health capital, it is my contention that this failure represents, at most, a methodological shortcoming. It does not amount to a theoretical weakness. Despite Brennan's best efforts, the ISEW and GPI remain soundly based on Irving Fisher's distinction between income and capital. Indeed, Brennan's suggested modifications to the ISEW and GPI do nothing but conflate income and capital, which, if taken on board, would lead to misleading indicators of total economic welfare. As for not reflecting both economic welfare and sustainability, I have long argued that the ISEW and GPI merely reflect the former and need to be supplemented by biophysical indicators to determine whether the economic welfare being enjoyed by a nation is sustainable. The fact that the ISEW and GPI only reflect economic welfare is not a weakness, since no indicator can or should attempt to reflect both conditions. The use of strong sustainability approaches to calculate the environment costs incorporated in the ISEW and GPI is not an exercise designed to measure sustainability. It is an exercise in good economic accounting. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

{"author":"Lawrence, A.","year":2003,"title":"No forest without timber?","dAbstract":"The spotlight on NTFPs has changed the face of forestry, but is also a product of its time, emerging in the context of increasingly pluralistic forest management. Early hopes that NTFPs would underpin rural livelihoods, and rescue rural populations from poverty while providing them with a reason to protect and manage forests, led to exaggerated claims of economic potential. They also tended to overlook the great diversity of products referred to, in terms of biological characteristics, and social and economic value, whilst simultaneously ascribing unreasonably lofty and altruistic goals to some of the world's poorest people. This overview of the contributions to this special issue of IFR points to the more sophisticated understanding of NTFP potential that has been acquired since the early 1990s. Focus on differences among NTFPs has led to literature around more specific groupings, such as 'bushmeat', 'indigenous forest fruits', or 'medicinal plants', each providing a more useful lens for assessing ways in which such products lead to sustainable rural livelihoods and forest management. However, contemplation of NTFPs as a group reminds us that forestry is a complex multi-stakeholder management system, wherein a focus on any one subset of components cannot ignore the ecological and social systems of which they form part. The methodological developments portrayed here advocate a more systemic approach, combining biological and economic approaches with NTFP users' own perceptions and knowledge within adaptive forest management, thereby side-stepping the hazards of the NTFP category.","journal":"International Forestry Review","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

The method, based on respondents' ranking of taxa, compares favourably with more time-consuming quantitative ethnobotanical techniques, and allows results to be differentiated according to social factors (gender and ethnic origin), and ecological and socio-economic context. We worked with 126 respondents in five indigenous and five immigrant communities within a forest-dominated landscape in the Peruvian Amazonia. There was wide variability among responses, indicating a complex of factors affecting value. The most valued family is Arecaceae, followed by Fabaceae and Moraceae. Overall, fruit and non-commercialised construction materials predominate but women tend to value fruit and other non-timber species more highly than timber, while the converse is shown by men. Indigenous respondents tend to value more the species used for fruit, domestic construction and other NTFPs, while immigrants tend to favour commercialised timber species. Across all communities, values are influenced by both markets and the availability of the taxa; as the favourite species become scarce, others replace them in perceived importance. As markets become more accessible, over-exploitation of the most valuable species and livelihood diversification contribute to a decrease in perceived value of the forest.

Coastal poverty is closely related to the nature and complexity of coastal ecosystems and often varies from poverty in other areas. This paper contends that adequately responding to the environmental and socioeconomic issues in the coastal zone requires assisting the poor cope with changes on the coast. In doing this it is important to appreciate how poverty is defined especially by the resource users themselves as well as the nature of the poverty-environment interactions. With women being highly dependent on coastal natural resources this paper draws on the experiences of 304 women from two communities to investigate coastal people's perception of poverty. It presents empirical evidence of poverty-environment linkages and examines implications of these linkages for the effective management of Ghana's coastal natural resources. The results show that respondents describe poverty through diversity of measures rather than solely as an absence of money. In addition their livelihood patterns revolve around the availability of some coastal natural resources. Since there is no national policy for the management of the coastal natural resources the paper concludes by recommending the development of a comprehensive Integrated Coastal Zone Management plan that incorporates the priorities and needs of local resource users, alleviates poverty whilst increasing awareness of resource users of more appropriate mechanisms for managing coastal resources.

In an attempt to ameliorate the current state of affairs, broad institutional arrangements and policy interventions have been put in place. However coastal natural resources are still being overexploited and the effects of this are felt more strongly by certain groups (such as women and the rural poor) than others. This has led to the argument pointing to an urgent need to include local resource users as active participants in environmental decision making and to incorporate their environmental values in the management of coastal natural resources. Using empirical data from women in two Ghanaian coastal communities, this paper highlights the importance of exploring how the environmental attitudes and values of women might be considered in the management of local coastal natural resources. It assesses effectiveness of the paired comparison methodology in this respects and how this method can be also used to prioritise their environmental concerns. The results show that in both areas respondents place the greatest importance on the coastal natural resources as sources of wealth creation and of food, values which are often described as being \"anthropocentric\". The paper thus argues that having discovered that the ecological value placed on natural resources is low, initiatives that could win the support of people would be those that link the livelihood and wellbeing to coastal NRM. It emphasizes the fact that conservation cannot exist outside of people and social systems; nor will it succeed unless they are linked to the welfare of resource users.

Moreover, the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of local actors, directly in charge of operations in the field, are a key to successful policy implementation. The connections between policy objectives and their implementation as well as the involvement of local actors' efforts in implementing policy objectives largely depend on the governance model in use. This article assesses the knowledge of local actors in relation to the biodiversity conservation objectives and tools in Lithuanian forest management. As a main framework for this study, the needs assessment approach was applied. The study used both in-depth open-ended interviews and follow-up telephone interviews. Two state forest enterprises in Lithuania were selected as the study sites.

The ensuing market, price, credit, and land tenure reforms allowed very reactive small farmers to use new technologies and to improve their livelihoods thanks to a dramatic agricultural growth, especially in irrigated rice production. This was particularly the case in the Mekong Delta and this article analyzes the impact of the economic liberalization reforms on this crucial agricultural system. The process of rice intensification is explained in detail, and an analysis of the closely related dynamics of diversification into non-rice activities is also provided. The intensif ication of rice-based production systems with more fixed capital, working capital, and labor led to an increase in family incomes. But the evolutionary pathways of farming households reveal that, depending on their initial endowment in productive resources, the pace of capital accumulation has been unequal among farmers. Consequently, economic reforms are leading to an increased differentiation among farming households in terms of types of production system and income level. At a time of increasing use of chemical inputs and renewable natural resources, and as social inequalities lead to labor migration, several key technological, environmental, and socioeconomic issues regarding the sustainability of rice intensification and agricultural diversification processes are discussed.","journal":"Southeast Asian Studies","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

However, little research effort has been devoted to exploring how farmers in those countries perceive climate variability and how the perceptions link to adaptive responses. This paper deploys information from three focus group discussions with 30 male farmers; and six in-depth interviews with one female and five male agricultural officers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Recorded 34-year meteorological data in the delta from 1978 to 2011 is also incorporated to demonstrate the actual climate variability of the region. We find that farmers are becoming increasingly conscious of local climate variability issues. However, they have limited understanding of the importance of adaptation to their livelihoods. They also have limited knowledge of where and who to contact for appropriate climate change adaptation information. No opinions about the link between global warming and local climate variability and change were observed. Casual observation via public media and personal experience dominated farmers' sources of information. Barriers to farmers' adaptation are not exclusively restricted to socio-economic factors and resource constraints; e.g. land tenure, technical knowledge, market, social relationship, credit, information, health care, and demographics. Maladaptation, habit, and the perception of the importance of climate variability and adaptation are found as additional constraints. Observed differences in farmers' and agricultural officers' perspectives regarding barriers to farmers' adaptation suggest important policy implications.

The central question in this paper-how to accommodate new land uses in traditional landscapes-cannot be approached without reference to some other topical issues that could be identified as driving forces: the development of renewable energies, the spreading of green networks, the maintenance (or return) of sustainable agriculture. The paper's analysis, with examples from Brittany, opens up a certain number of principles which can serve as a guideline in territorial development: acceptable scale of development, adjustment to land resources, and maintenance of multi-functionality, maximum threshold of specialization. This is necessary if we are to better understand, and then implement: an acceptable scale of development, adjustment to land resources, maintenance of multi-functionality. The landscape expertise might then be useful not only for landscape protection and planning, but also to consider broad lines of future development adapted to the 'sense of place', thus improving economic, ecological and social values.

Moreover, the conventional models in population dynamics and bio-economy have not proved operative in managing these resources, most of which are being chronically overexploited. In this paper co-viability is proposed as a conceptual model of fisheries designed to contribute to the definition of a practicable fisheries management. First, we present the crisis context in which the exploitation of marine resources and scientific research operate. The recent history of the Peruvian anchovy fisheries exemplifies the complex overlapping of political, bio-ecological and economic systems. We then introduce the results of several dynamic modelling exercises at different interfaces: i) environment - resource, where inertia seems to be the driving factor, and ii) resource - exploitation in which technical and biological diversity interact. An example relating to the pelagic market illustrates the problems of scale (global and local) linked to this issue. After this, we present and discuss the question of fisheries management with respect to the standard bio-economic approach, and the new alternatives. Fisheries systems are interactive sets of entities (ecosystems, exploitations, markets, institutions), each of which is characterised by a specific pace of evolution and specific functional scales. Complex interrelations are generated by interaction among their specific (biological and technical) diversities and by interdependence of their respective functional scales (global-local). Management of these systems proceeds on a sector-based approache linked to compartmentalised scientific knowledge. New conceptual settings have been proposed to address the management of fisheries from different perspectives. None emerges as more relevant than the other. Beyond its usefulness as a common concept, the co-viability approach aims to work out which articulations would enable a mutual enrichment of different knowledge and perceptions. It could for instance contribute to reconciling the currently conflicting conservationist and productivistic standpoints in the field of marine resources.","journal":"Co-viabilite des systemes halieutiques","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Forest resources in the tropics have declined rapidly over the past century and therefore many developing countries in the tropics have reforestation programs. Although reforestation is a long-term process with long-term benefits, existing evaluations of the success of these programs tends to focus on short-term establishment success indicators. This paper presents a review of reforestation assessment that highlights the need to not only consider short-term establishment success, but also longer-term growth and maturation success, environmental success and socio-economic success. In addition, we argue that reforestation assessment should not be based on success indicators alone, but should incorporate the drivers of success, which encompasses an array of biophysical, socio-economic, institutional and project characteristics. This is needed in order to understand the reasons why reforestation projects succeed or fail and therefore to design more successful projects in future. The paper presents a conceptual model for reforestation success assessment that links key groups of success indicators and drivers.

The case of the Philippines","dAbstract":"In response to substantial deforestation over many decades, large scale reforestation programs are being implemented across many tropical developing countries. Examples include the United Nations Billion Trees Campaign, the National Greening Program in the Philippines, and the 5 million ha reforestation program in Vietnam. However, while substantial investments are being made in reforestation, little information exists on the drivers influencing reforestation success and how these interact to determine environmental and socio-economic outcomes. In this study we surveyed 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, The Philippines to identify the drivers that most influence reforestation success as measured by key indicators drawn from the literature, including interactions between drivers and between drivers and indicators. We investigated 98 potential success drivers, including technical and biophysical factors; socio-economic factors; institutional, policy and management factors; and reforestation project characteristics. We also measured 12 success indicators, including forest establishment, forest growth, environmental and socio-economic success indicators. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to identify significant relationships among drivers and indicators and this analysis was used to develop a system of driver and indicator relationships. Based on this we found that revegetation method, funding source, education and awareness campaigns, the dependence of local people on forests, reforestation incentives, project objectives, forest protection mechanisms and the condition of road infrastructure were highly connected drivers that influenced multiple success indicators either directly or indirectly. We conclude that policies targeting revegetation methods, socioeconomic incentives, forest protection mechanisms, sustainable livelihoods, diversification of funding and partnerships, technical support, and infrastructure development are likely to have a broad systemic and beneficial effect on the success of reforestation programs in tropical developing countries.

Wildfires pose a major hazard to people's lives, livelihoods and ecosystems in South Africa with poor communities generally being highly exposed and vulnerable. Although general information exists, an adequate understanding of the fire regimes, how they vary spatially, and the related vegetation management requirements is lacking. This study resolves the environmental variation in fire regimes across South Africa into a systematic framework for wildfire risk assessment and ecologically sound ecosystem management. The available descriptions of fire regimes, vegetation classifications, and fire occurrence data from remote sensing are synthesized to derive a set of 13 distinct fire-ecology types, that is, sets of vegetation units which experience distinct fire regimes. Fuel dynamics, fire-dependence, ecologically acceptable fire regimes, and guidelines for fire management are described for each of these fire-ecology types and they are grouped into three categories: fire dependent, fire independent and fire sensitive. Fire-dependent ecosystems comprise more than 60% of South Africa and fire-independent ones 32%, the latter mainly in the arid west and northwest, while the remainder are fire sensitive. Fire-dependent systems require fires and generally coincide with the greatest rural population densities. The outputs from this framework can be used to analyse wildfire risk and translate the risk into practical management measures which are responsive to local ecological, social and institutional settings.

Exports of these resources and foreign fishing access agreements are also important, at least from a large-scale economic perspective. In recent years, concerns have been voiced amongst local fishers and industry groups regarding the growth of the country's fishing effort. Despite these concerns, existing knowledge of the scale, composition and trends of Malagasy fisheries remains poor, and there is negligible information regarding unreported catches and illegal fishing in Madagascar's waters. Small-scale fisheries, which are often substantial in developing countries such as Madagascar, are often unreported or underestimated. Unfortunately, fisheries legislations, management plans and foreign fishing access agreements are often influenced by these incomplete data, leading to serious over-estimations of resource availability. This also appears to be the situation in Madagascar, where the reconstruction of total catches by all Malagasy fisheries sectors conducted here showed that total catches between 1950 and 2008 were twice the volume reported by national fisheries agencies. Most importantly, much of the subsistence sector is missing from official statistics, and signs of decline have already been observed in several stocks, suggesting that current levels of catches are likely to be exceeding sustainable yields. This has profound implications for the economic and ecological sustainability of fisheries, as well as food security in a country where people rely heavily on the ocean for their daily protein needs and livelihoods.

This growing integration shapes the development of communities and influences their relationship to the natural environment. Where livelihoods are constrained by resource limitations and the productivity of labor in farm activities is low, it may result in a shift to nonfarm activities, which may under some conditions improve wellbeing and relieve pressure on natural resources. The possibility of such a \"win-win\" development pathway has important implications for development and environmental policy. In this article we use original qualitative and quantitative data to examine environmental and social changes during the last half century in a rural area of Morocco, seeking evidence of such a pathway. While our case study supports the hypothesis that nonfarm diversification in a context of resource scarcity allowed people to improve their material living conditions, the effects of economic integration and nonfarm diversification on the environment were mixed.

{"author":"Le Quesne, W. J. F.","year":2009,"title":"Are flawed MPAs any good or just a new way of making old mistakes?","dAbstract":"The case for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is often supported by the observation that present fisheries management has failed. This overlooks the fact that, often, management plans are not implemented in accordance with advice and that subsequent regulations are frequently violated. Evidence is emerging that MPAs may be equally open to mismanagement, either because MPAs are smaller than recommended or through lack of compliance. Therefore, it is interesting to ask whether MPAs would also fail if they are not properly implemented or enforced. A population model was used to examine this question. The model demonstrates that biomass and yield are reduced, and can collapse under \"bad\" MPA management. When illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing occurred within the MPA, yield and biomass declined almost linearly with increasing poaching pressure. Yield was more robust than biomass to the effects of making MPAs smaller than the optimum size for limited reductions in MPA size. Varying the degree of mobility had little impact on the response of yield and biomass. This analysis demonstrates the vulnerability of MPAs to design and governance failings, and the importance of considering enforcement during MPA design.

Equally, however, it is a complex and powerful natural environment, which means that the coastal zone often becomes a focus of conflict with multiple users competing for limited space and resources. Understanding the causes of, and determining solutions to, the ensuing problems requires inputs from a range of analyses across sectors and disciplines. However, different disciplinary and sectoral approaches frequently use different investigative methods, language, and means of presenting results. This article presents a framework that has been developed in collaboration with Indian institutions over the past three years in an effort to address some of these fundamental problems of analysis and translation into policy action.

In accordance with this aim, I will proceed to contrast certain Western attitudes towards \"individual freedom\", \"selfinterested behaviour\", \"individual and communal interests\" and \"private ownership\" with attitudes and values expressed in the traditional Melanesian approach. In order to demonstrate the latter, I will briefly touch upon the phenomenon of \"wantokism\" and indicate how the Melanesian values associated with this concept find their locus in the system of \"customary communal ownership\". Subsequently, I will describe how the emergence of a cash economy and the attachment to Western gadgetry and products have effected injury to the environment and undermined values which have previously maintained Melanesian social cohesion. While admitting that little can be done to eradicate the desire for cash and the products it can buy, I suggest that Melanesian communities and the environment itself would receive more protection if future development in Papua New Guinea embraced a system which incorporated certain of the traditional Melanesian values through the preservation of the communal form of land tenure. Ultimately, I suggest a way in which customary communal land tenure can be integrated into the established Anglo-Australian legal system.

Misunderstood dynamics and the negotiation of knowledge, power, and policy","dAbstract":"This paper addresses the challenges of building pathways to Sustainability in the context of contested knowledge and power relations in environment and development. Drawing on two case studies concerning tropical forests in West Africa and the Caribbean, it explores clashes between the conceptions of social - ecological systems embedded in dominant scientific and policy practices, and the more dynamic, nonequilibrial perspectives that emerge from understandings of forest history and users' own experiences. Forest and conservation policy, I find, have persistently ignored these dynamics. Yet, as people and nature have 'bitten back', forest histories are revealed as mutually constituting interplays of ecological process, social practice, policy and intervention, and response. Policy makers often do not see this, and are thus surprised when their schemes fail. In this paper, I argue that alternative analytical approaches are needed that take seriously human - ecological dynamics, history, path dependency, and the ways in which different people frame or construct problems, linked with notions of Sustainability that respect diverse goals-including forest users' own. This, in turn, suggests the need for alternative approaches to the governance of environment and development issues that are more adaptive, deliberative, and reflexive, and for politically engaged efforts to institute these in contexts where pervasive power -knowledge relations perpetuate less dynamic views.","journal":"Environment and Planning A","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Arguing that these underlying assumptions and policy narratives are flawed as guidelines for policy, this article presents an alternative perspective which starts from the politics of resource access and control among diverse social actors, and sees patterns of environmental change as the outcomes of negotiation or contestation between their conflicting perspectives. The notion of 'environmental entitlements' encapsulates this shift in perspective, and provides analytical tools to specify the benefits that people gain from the environment which contribute to their well-being. The processes by which people gain environmental endowments and entitlements are, in turn, shaped by diverse institutions, both formal and informal.","journal":"IDS Bulletin","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Using guidance derived from decision theory and management science, we develop 18 criteria to evaluate the likely effectiveness of nine integrated fishery assessment systems. The assessment systems do not consistently consider four key criteria: the socio-economic impacts of fisheries, the provision of food security, the local relevance of the assessment to the fishery under assessment, and the independent peer review of assessment outcomes. Other important areas of weakness include the lack of appropriate consultation processes relating to both the design of the assessment system and the outcomes of fishery assessments, and limitations in the quality of data and information used in assessments. Improvements will be needed in these areas across all the systems we evaluated if fishers, consumers, managers and other stakeholders are to be provided with consistently reliable assessment outcomes, and an assurance of the sustainability of capture fisheries.

In Eastern Africa, wetlands provide resources at multiple spatial and temporal levels through farming, fishing, livestock ownership and a host of other ecosystem services that sustain the local economy and individual livelihoods. As part of a broader effort to describe future development scenarios for East African coastal wetlands, this qualitative study focuses on understanding the processes by which river water depletion has affected local food production systems in Kenya's Tana River Delta over the past 50 years, and how this situation has impacted residents' livelihoods and well-being. Interviews performed in six villages among various ethnic groups, geographical locations and resource profiles indicated that the agro-ecological production systems formerly in place were adapted to the river's dynamic flooding patterns. As these flooding patterns changed, the local population diversified and abandoned or adopted various farming, fishing and livestock-rearing techniques. Despite these efforts, the decrease in water availability affected each subcomponent of the production systems under study, which led to their collapse in the 1990s. Water depletion negatively impacted local human well-being through the loss of food security. The current study provides a detailed account of the dynamics of agro-ecological production systems facing the effects of river water depletion in a wetland-associated environment in Sub-Saharan Africa.

This target is to reduce by two thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015. Accepting such a target implies de facto that most child deaths could be avoided. Recent sources are examined and the UN-IGME data set is used for the comparison as being the one favoured by the United Nations. Child deaths are falling but not quickly enough, particularly in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In this part, a search of the literature for Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia, the five countries composing the Maghreb is performed, and shows that four of these countries are in good progress and possibly on track. The main concern, both globally and for four Maghreb countries is that the share of neonatal death is rising. This brings on new challenges, because the means for addressing this issue differ from, validated policies such as vaccination, or diarrhea control. Scaling up low-cost interventions will be a priority. In the second part an in depth description of the process in Algeria is made. This has included successive steps, starting from independence. Through a combination of interventions at community level and at health care points regular, sustainable progress has been achieved. These have included vaccination, family planning, skilled attendance at birth, infrastructure development, human resources, free access to care and prevention, and improved statistics of birth and death. The new challenges related to the growing share of neonatal mortality are discussed. It is acknowledged that neonatal survival requires, at population level, modern medical care. This means the problem is fundamentally different from post neonatal mortality where socio-economic development is the main determinant. A perinatal programme has been established in Algeria. Kangaroo Mother Care has been introduced in Algeria more than a decade ago and has been a success story.

Most studies focused on traditional ecological or indigenous knowledge. Three simple questions were addressed: (1) How are changes in climate recognized? (2) What is known about how to adapt to changes in climate? (3) How do people learn about how to adapt? Awareness of change is an important element of local knowledge. Changes in climate are recognized at multiple time scales from observations that warn of imminent extreme weather through expectations for the next season to identification of multi-year historical trends. Observations are made of climate, its impact on physical resources, and bio-indicators. Local knowledge about how to adapt can be divided into four major classes: land and water management, physical infrastructure, livelihood strategies, and social institutions. Adaptation actions vary with time scale of interest from dealing with risks of disaster from extreme weather events, through slow onset changes such as seasonal droughts, to dealing with long-term multi-year shifts in climate. Local knowledge systems differ in the capacities and ways in which they support learning. Many are dynamic and draw on information from other places, whereas others are more conservative and tightly institutionalized. Past experience of events and ways of learning may be insufficient for dealing with a novel climate. Once the strengths and limitations of local knowledge (like those of science) are grasped the opportunities for meaningful hybridization of scientific and local knowledge for adaptation expand.

We use system innovation theory to help explain how niche substitution led to a regime change within a Thai aquaculture industry trying to maintain international competitiveness but under pressures from a global landscape in which consumers are increasingly concerned with health and ecological sustainability. Support from a vertically integrated major firm, an extensive foundation of learning networks within the industry, and early profitability made the scaling-up and embedding of the experiment with white shrimp very rapid once the formal ban on import of exotic broodstock was lifted. Disease management with domesticated, specific pathogen-free strains of white shrimp has proven much easier than with black shrimp still dependent on capture of wild broodstock. Moreover relative production costs are lower. The switch in species had significant consequences for the environment and firms. Using life cycle analysis we found that rearing white shrimp requires less resource and produces less waste than black shrimp. The shift in regime, however, also made it more difficult for small farms and hatchery businesses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Formal and informal institutions help shape exposure, sensitivity and capacities to respond of individuals, social groups and social-ecological systems. In this paper we draw on several case studies of flood events and flood-affected communities to first assess how current practices reflect various laws, procedures, programs and policies for managing floods and disasters and then explore the implications for dealing with additional challenges posed by climate change. Our analysis identifies several institutional traps which need to be overcome if vulnerability is to be reduced, namely capture of agendas by technical elites, single-level or centralized concentration of capacities, organizational fragmentation and overemphasis on reactive crisis management. Possible responses are to expand public participation in managing risks, build adaptive capacities at multiple levels and link them, integrate flood disaster management and climate change adaptation into development planning, prioritize risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups and strengthen links between knowledge and practice. Responses like these could help reduce vulnerabilities under current climate and flood regimes, while also improving capacities to handle the future which every way that unfolds.

This special issue reports results from a group of AMMA studies regrouped in the component \"Couplage de l'AtmosphÃ¨re Tropicale et du Cycle Hydrologique\" (CATCH). AMMA-CATCH studies focus on measuring and understanding land surface properties and processes in West Africa, the role of terrestrial systems in altering boundary layer dynamics, and thus the potential that surface hydrology and biology, and human land use practices, may directly or indirectly affect monsoon dynamics and rainfall in the region. AMMA-CATCH studies focus on three intensively instrumented mesoscale sites in Mali, Niger and Benin that sample across the 100-1300 mm/annum rainfall gradient of the Sahel, Sudan and North-Guinean bioclimatic zones. Studies report on: (i) surface-boundary layer interactions that may influence atmospheric convergence and convective processes and thus rainfall type, timing and amount; (ii) vegetation dynamics at seasonal to decadal time-scales that may respond to, and alter, atmospheric processes; (iii) surface-atmosphere fluxes of heat, water and carbon dioxide that directly influence the atmosphere; (iv) soil moisture variability in space and time that provide the proximate control on vegetation activity, evapotranspiration and energy balance; and (v) local and mesoscale modeling of hydrology and land surface-atmosphere exchanges to assess their role in the hydrological, atmospheric and rainfall dynamics of West Africa. The AMMA-CATCH research reported in this issue will be extended in future years as measurements and analysis continue and are concluded within the context of both CATCH and the wider AMMA study. This body of research will contribute to an improved understanding of the functioning of the coupled West African system, and enhance our ability to model and predict rainfall, vegetation and biogeochemical dynamics across time-scales (day, year, decade, and century), and in response to changing climate and land use.

Wildlife over-exploitation is severe in Indonesia, especially on Sulawesi, where human resources and funding are inadequate to monitor the wildlife trade and enforce existing protection laws. In response, the Wildlife Crimes Unit program was established in December 2001 to: (i) monitor wildlife transportation into North Sulawesi and market sales; (ii) provide legal and technical support to law enforcement agencies; and (iii) promote public awareness of wildlife and protection laws. Over a two-year period, 6963 wild mammals en route to markets were encountered (âˆ¼8 individuals h -1) and 96,586 wild mammals were documented during market surveys. The trade of some protected mammals declined significantly over this period, but overall trade in wild mammals increased by 30%. High volume of trade in non-protected animals such as the Sulawesi pig Sus celebensis and large flying foxes (Pteropodidae), raise concerns about the sustainability of current harvesting. To combat this problem, we recommend that: (1) efforts are continued to reduce trade in protected species; (2) protected status is extended to heavily traded but non-protected taxa, such as flying foxes; (3) the effects of hunting on rat and bat populations, as well as its impact on forest dynamics, are quantified; and (4) work is carried out with local communities to strengthen awareness, set sustainable limits on wild mammal harvesting, and establish practical mechanisms for enforcing these limits.

This paper investigates effects of interactions, perceptions of protected areas (PAs) and sociodemographic variables on conservation attitudes, and the correlates of illegal resource extraction among 660 households from 33 villages bordering eight PAs on Sulawesi (Indonesia). Mixed-effect multiple regression analyses showed that the most important predictors of the support for PAs included the degree of involvement in management, presence/absence of PA-human conflict, perceived sustainability of forest resources and length of residency in Sulawesi. Notably, active participation in community management by transmigrants and the reconciliation of land-rights conflicts for natives may promote favourable conservation attitudes. Ordination and correlation analyses also revealed that the extent of illegal resource harvesting activities, such as hunting and logging, were significantly influenced by a negative conservation attitude and past conflict with PA establishment. Garnering support for PAs through conservation education and resolving land-rights disputes could potentially alleviate illegal resource extraction. The disparity in resource extraction patterns among the villages across all PAs confirms the importance of adopting site-specific conservation strategies that may make PAs across the biologically unique yet critically threatened Indonesian Archipelago more effective.

The earliest environmental policies were targeted to negate health impacts. This focus has become less obvious during the last decades when environmental problems became more diffuse and covered larger areas and regions. Nowadays, degradation of natural resources, climate change and the decline in biodiversity are the major environmental problems. To deal effectively with these problem international conventions and national policies strong ly relate also to developmental issues, equity and improved human well-being. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA; www.millenniumassessment.org), a four-year international work programme designed to meet the needs of decision-makers for scientific information on ecosystem change, has taken up the challenge to comprehensively assess the consequences of environmental change for ecosystems, ecosystems services and human well-being. The MA focuses on how changes in ecosystem services have affected human well-being, how ecosystem changes may affect people in future decades, and what types of responses can be adopted at local, national or global scales to improve ecosystem management and thereby contribute to human well-being and poverty alleviation.

{"author":"Lehman, J.","year":2013,"title":"Expecting the sea:The nature of uncertainty on Sri Lanka's East coast","dAbstract":"The residents of Sri Lanka's East coast face a highly uncertain future following three decades of armed conflict, the devastating 2004 tsunami, and the shifting regimes of policies and aid practices that have followed. Furthermore, livelihoods in coastal areas in Sri Lanka are vulnerable to imminent yet uncertain climatic changes. Accounting for this indeterminacy requires going beyond a dichotomy in scholarship that understands uncertainty as either instrumentalized by hegemonic forces or independently troubling policy at all levels. Therefore, I closely examine the how uncertainty works in networks of conflict, disaster, and climate change, uniting them materially and discursively, albeit highly unevenly. To do so, I build on a relational approach that considers networks and assemblages as ways to approach heterogeneous social formations. In particular, I draw on Hetherington and Lee's (2000) concept of the blank figure, that which is precisely not an actor but formatively influences social order by enacting presence or absence across difference, with the immanent ability to drastically change outcomes. I find this formation useful in interpreting a field inquiry in Batticaloa, a coastal district in Sri Lanka's Eastern region, where I spoke with fisherfolk and other coastal actors about changes to the ocean that cut across the boundaries of armed conflict, natural disaster, and climate change. I argue that uncertainty permeates the coastal network in both co-optable and uncontainable ways, causing conflict, disaster, and climate change to co-constitute one another at the same time as they are unbound.

{"author":"Lehmann, V. A.","year":2001,"title":"Forests and their perception by the general public. On the analysis of a present-day cultural subject","dAbstract":"Present-day perception of forests by the general public is presented in this paper on the basis of a qualitative empirical study. The question raised by cultural anthropologists is not about the state of the forests but rather about people's subjective thinking and experience of forests, how they wish forests to be, in what ways they make use of woods and which contemporary traditions (literature, arts, music etc.) form the basis of currently active cultural patterns. People's emotions evoked by forests usually go back to childhood experience such as memories of family outings and early role models. Emotional bonds are usually related to specific kinds of forest, e.g. the spruce forests of the Harz. The general public's idea of a beautiful forest is reflected in the subjectively modified cultural images created mainly during the 19th century Romantic period. By the end of the 19th century these cultural patterns had also reached the industrial working class. The study reveals a difference in landscape perception according to gender, men preferring the panoramic view in the tradition of trivialized landscape painting, whereas women tend to also concentrate on the microcosm of mosses and ground vegetation in the forest. In this day and age ecological concerns are superimposed on, and to some extent dominate, these aesthetic ideas. To this day, forests at night and even at mid-day have remained slightly frightening and mysterious. Traditions from \"pre-modern\" times, in particular fairy stories and legends, still have an impact on the present. In exemplary fashion these images, designed to create the illusion of harmony between mankind and the environment, are operating in the urban middle class and, in particular, in esoteric circles. However, even recent historical events such as Chernobyl and other post-World-War-II episodes are interpreted as \"myths\" according to the examples offered by the traditional forms of forest perception. The mass hysteria associated with the so-called \"forest decline\" in the 1980ies needs to be interpreted within the context of public forest perception as characterized by a romantic, holistic view of the world, traditional myths and anxieties. As a result of Germany's political and cultural history, forests remain a highly sensitive cultural and political issue in German society. The political function of \"the forest\" as a national symbol, valid until about the middle of the 20th century, is steadily losing significance due to recent history and its \"German forest ideology\".","journal":"Waldbewusstsein.

They have been used for almost 500 years as a fruit crop, a defensive hedge, a support for cochineal production of dye (carminic acid) and, more recently, as a fodder crop and as a standing buffer feed for drought periods; they can also play a key role in erosion control and land rehabilitation, particularly in arid and semi-arid zones, and as a shelter, refuge and feed resource for wildlife (birds and mammals alike). This article analyses the ecological requirements of cacti and particularly of the common and most utilized spineless type, Opuntia ficus-indica forma inermis, its drought-tolerance, food and feed value for humans, herbivores and fructivores and its potential for land rehabilitation, cheap and easy erosion control and the rational use of marginal land. Cactus plantations and hedges probably cover about 1,000,000 ha in the Basin (including O. ficus-indica forma amyclaea), particularly in the Mediterranean islands and North Africa; but, unlike in other subtropical zones, cacti have never become an invasive pest in the Basin. The spineless cacti never become invasive pests anyway, as they are grazed out, unless totally protected from herbivores, either naturally (cliffs) or artificially (fences).

Based on a case study of the village of Beidian, located in a drought-prone region in northern China, this study demonstrates that when faced with multiple pressures of regional climate change, drought risk and rural poverty, reasonable adjustments in land use patterns can serve as an effective adaptation strategy in the agricultural sector. We used household questionnaires, in-depth interviews with village managers, and land use surveys at the farming plot level to quantify the relationship between land use change and drought mitigation effects. Our findings indicate that in the past decade, the farming practices in Beidian have transformed from a complete reliance on the winter wheat-summer corn rotation to a new diversified mode of apple as the main crop and corn and coarse cereals as the subsidiary crops. The current farming mode is proven to possess a stronger adaptive capacity to drought due to its higher water-saving efficiency and economic benefit, which facilitates rural poverty reduction and socio-economic development. This study presents a feasible approach to address adaptation strategies at the local level, which provides policymakers with information on how to best support farm-level adaptation and to reduce farmers' vulnerability to climatic extremes within the broader context of climate change.

However, their mutual relationships are still unclear so far particularly in the field of disaster risk reduction, which to some extent blocks the reasonable risk analysis and scientific decision making. This paper performed a brief overview on the basic definitions and evolution processes of vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation, and tentatively categorized past diverse thoughts of their relationships into three modalities, such as, vulnerability preference, resilience preference, and overlapped relationships. From a \"hit-damage-recovery-learning cycle\" insight and based on an empirical case study, we put forward two conceptual frameworks to address the relationships of vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation within the disaster risk domain, and we further discussed their broader implications in terms of disaster risk management and social-ecological sustainability. In an attempt to bring together the analytical frameworks of vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation, this study indicates that a sustainable adaptation strategy to the unavoidable disasters or changes should not only seek to reduce the vulnerability of a social-ecological system, but also to foster its resilience and adaptive capacity to future uncertainties and potential risks.

Based on the causal analysis of the historical typhoon cases in the Guangdong Province of China, this study indicates that structural measures alone are not sufficient to resist and offset the impacts caused by typhoon disasters. Additionally, structural measures are unsustainable due to their high investment and low security. Adaptive governance, which uses non-structural measures and resilience building, is a feasible and cost-effective strategy for responding to the cascading effects of typhoon disasters. Multi-stakeholder participation and vertical-horizontal coordination are essential for providing adaptive governance to typhoon disasters. A risk-sharing model was put forward by bringing together the government, insurance companies, and victims. Furthermore, a favorable atmosphere for public participation in disaster risk reduction can be fostered and should be a long-term adaptation strategy.Â The views and framework of adaptive governance provide decision makers with insights on coastal disaster risk management within the broader context of climate change.

We found that the productivity of project grazing sites was on average within 1% of control sites for the 20 years before the project but generated 11% more biomass on average than the control areas from 2000 to 2009. To better understand the benefits of the improved grasslands to local people, we conducted 280 household interviews, 8 focus group discussions, and 31 key informant interviews across 6 districts. We found a 12% greater median annual income as well as a range of other socioeconomic benefits for project households compared to control households in the same areas. Overall, the project generated measurable benefits to both nature and people. The key factors underlying project achievements that may be replicable by other conservation projects include the community-driven approach of the project, knowledge exchanges within and between communities inside and outside the country, a project-supported local community organizer in each district, and strong community leadership.

The expectation is that such efforts will change local knowledge, attitudes and ultimately behavior. This is one of the first studies to assess the efficacy of using education and outreach activities to improve community knowledge and attitudes about an MPA. Random sample surveys in 2005 and 2010 (n=1213) before and after education and outreach activities are compared. Program budgets for the same period give the investment levels. With an investment level averaging US$24 per capita/year, the result was an average increase of 33% in \"yes\" responses across 15 indicators of knowledge and attitudes towards marine conservation. The increase in knowledge and positive attitudes was associated with a large decrease in \"not sure\" responses, suggesting that community members with fewer initial preconceptions are the most effective target for education and outreach activities. This study demonstrates that investments in MPA education and outreach can generate increases in local knowledge and positive attitudes, and changing knowledge and attitudes is expected to contribute to the long-term compliance with MPA regulations.

A livelihoods approach was used to enable land managers to define, describe, and evaluate locally relevant indicators of NRM capacity. Constraints to capacity were perceived as externally imposed or related to poor vertical linkages between land managers and government agencies. Conversely, local characteristics of regional organizations, communities and individuals were often described as enabling capacity. There was substantial consistency across workshops and there were widespread indications of declining capacity to contribute to effective NRM.

Moreover, their perceptions may be relevant for monitoring the effects of MPAs on extractive activities. This study analyzes artisanal fishers' perceptions of the performance of a north-western Mediterranean coastal MPA, which encompasses two no-take zones (NTZs). Three viewpoints have been considered: the effect on the personal activity of fishers, the effect on the local fishery and the effect on the ecosystem. In order to test the hypothesis that biomass export (spillover) - which had previously been evidenced from the two NTZs - may influence fishers' perceptions of NTZ effects, fishers' perceptions were compared with both declared and observed fishing activity over an one-year period. The results show that negative perceptions of NTZs are either nil or are negligible. Most fishers are aware of the beneficial effects of NTZs on ecosystems and fisheries. However, they remain to be convinced of the beneficial effects of the NTZs on their own activity. For instance, the proximity of a NTZ appears never to be involved in the choice of a fishing spot. This partial lack of correspondence between scientific expectation and fishers' perceptions is discussed in the light of fishing habits in the zone adjacent to NTZs, and takes into account fishing grounds, targeted species and seniority (defined as the number of years the fisher has been fishing within the MPA). All three factors appear to influence fishers' perceptions. For example, having a positive perception about a NTZ and spending more time fishing in the adjacent zone are habits that can be associated with fishers with less seniority. Fishers' perceptions obviously indicate the social acceptance of the MPA and are an essential monitoring tool for MPA managers. However, perceptions cannot be seen as a substitute for scientific monitoring, as both approaches are clearly complementary.

In this paper, we assessed impacts of immigration on dry forests and options for improved management in a resettlement district in north-western Ethiopia. Key informants interviews, focus group discussions and household questionnaire survey were used to collect data. The results indicated that forests of the district are degrading in spatial coverage and quality. The most important drivers were land use change, excessive wood harvest, grazing pressure and forest fire following immigration. The continuous influx of people with different origins, cultures, religions and lengths of residence in the district underscores absence of social bonds for collective action to regulate access. This, coupled with weak formal regulatory system, market forces and policy incentives for farming, resulted in a near open access situation. Our findings confirm the negative relationships between migration and environment not necessarily because of the mere population number added through immigration but because of lack of regulatory frameworks (formal or informal) and poor social capital. Enforcing existing policy of farm size and putting institutional framework on the ground to regulate rate of immigration, extraction of forest products and to encourage tree planting to meet wood demand are suggested measures. We conclude that Government programmes that opt for resettlement as a measure for poverty alleviation must also have mitigating measures to reducing negative impacts on the natural resource base. Thus, the trade-off between environment and development must be carefully managed.

Utilizing an importance-performance analysis (IPA) evaluation framework, this article presents a comparative case study of federal and state land and natural resource manager perceptions of agency performance on factors influencing adaptive capacity in two U.S. regions (northern Colorado and southwestern South Dakota). Results revealed several important findings with substantial management implications. First, none of the managers ranked the adaptive capacity factors as a low priority. Second, managers held the perception that their agencies were performing either neutrally or poorly on most factors influencing adaptive capacity. Third, gap analysis revealed that significant improvements are required to facilitate optimal agency functioning when dealing with climate change-related management issues. Overall, results suggest that a host of institutional and policy-oriented (e.g., lack of clear mandate to adapt to climate change), financial and human resource (e.g., inadequate staff and financial resources), informational (e.g., inadequate research and monitoring programs) and contextual barriers (e.g., sufficient regional networks to mitigate potential transboundary impacts) currently challenge the efficient and effective integration of climate change into decision-making and management within agencies working in these regions. The IPA framework proved to be an effective tool to help managers identify and understand agency strengths, areas of concern, redundancies, and areas that warrant the use of limited funds and/or resource re-allocation in order to enhance adaptive capacity and maximize management effectiveness with respect to climate change.

The specific contributions of community and domestic forests to the evolution of the prevailing socio-ecological system are assessed through a diachronic study of a village which is located in southern Cameroon. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework is used to compare the progress of this social-ecological system between January 2008 and December 2009. The overall evolution of livelihoods was found to be positive during that period. In this case study, domestic forests and community forests are based on complementary models, which are often observed in southern Cameroon. Domestic forests constitute the basis of socio-economic development, while community forests might offer opportunities for a local-level carbon sequestration payment mechanism.

N.","year":2013,"title":"Multiple use forest management in Central Africa: Perceptions, implementation and evolving practice","dAbstract":"Although Multiple Use Forest Management (MUFM) is promoted in Central Africa in its forest codes, the approach is not well understood and rarely implemented in either production or community forests. This article presents findings from 62 interviews with people involved in forest management in Cameroon, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which have brought out three different interpretations of the MUFM approach: through sustainable logging integrating forest uses in other sectors as a secondary consideration, through customary uses of resources by local populations, and through formal plans for the management of forest ecosystem goods and services. A detailed analysis of eight case studies shows that in practice, sustainable forest management focuses almost exclusively on timber extraction, although hunting for game and harvesting non-timber forest products are always mentioned in management documents. On the other hand, ecosystem services - carbon sequestration and catchment basin protection - and public goods are virtually never mentioned. Including different uses in management documents does not suffice to ensure that they are systematically taken into account in practice. Three possibilities are explored here for strengthening MUFM in the Congo Basin: designing MUFM approaches on the scale of the landscape rather than the forest, improving the content of management documents to include and enhance the value of all forest uses, and strengthening controls over the effective application of management documents through certification or better law enforcement.","journal":"Gestion forestiÃ¨re multi-usages en Afrique centrale : Perceptions, mises en oeuvre et Ã©volutions","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}
{"author":"Leslie, P.; McCabe, J. T.","year":2013,"title":"Response diversity and resilience in social-ecological systems","dAbstract":"Recent work in ecology suggests that the diversity of responses to environmental change among species contributing to the same ecosystem function can strongly influence ecosystem resilience. To render this important realization more useful for understanding coupled human-natural systems, we broaden the concept of response diversity to include heterogeneity in human decisions and action. Simply put, not all actors respond the same way to challenges, opportunities, and risks. The range, prevalence, and spatial and temporal distributions of different responses may be crucial to the resilience or the transformation of a social-ecological system and thus have a bearing on human vulnerability and well-being in the face of environmental, socioeconomic, and political change. Response diversity can be seen at multiple scales (e.g., household, village, region), and response diversity at one scale may act synergistically with or contrary to the effects of diversity at another scale. Although considerable research on the sources of response diversity has been done, our argument is that the consequences of response diversity warrant closer attention. We illustrate this argument with examples drawn from our studies of two East African pastoral populations and discuss the relationship of response diversity to characteristics of social-ecological systems that can promote or diminish resilience.

The privatization of land in Samburu fits neither the optimistic scenario of property rights theorists nor the gloomy forecasts of those who favor communal ownership in pastoral areas. While many households experienced gains from privatization this was due to the particular ways in which the process of land tenure change proceeded and how agriculture was integrated into their pastoral livelihood. Local level norms have emerged that reinforce the value of land ownership for residents and discourage land sales, effectively preserving the pastoral way of life. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper seeks to contribute insights from a process undertaken within rural areas in Lesotho. A learning-by-doing and people-centred approach was explored within a qualitative multiple case study to integrate biodiversity considerations within the broader livelihoods sustainability context. Stakeholders collectively determined interpretations, aspirations and priorities for action planning and pathways that sustain biodiversity. This process yielded a functional context-specific sustainability assessment framework to guide stakeholders when embarking on biodiversity interventions that enhance supply of ecosystem services in and outside protected areas. However, the effectiveness of the process requires that it should be nested within an enabling environment characterised by relevant international and national biodiversity policy and strategic frameworks, decision- making structures, funding, tools and expertise, sensitisation and capacity-building.

They have done so since time immemorial and are singularly responsible for the good conservation value that the area represents. The area has the longest history of conservation championed by a local traditional authority in Lesotho. From December 1999 to March 2000 we conducted a survey that was aimed at making an inventory of resources, on which people rely, that will be affected by the establishment of a biosphere reserve linking the Tsehlanyane National Park and the Bokong Nature Reserve. In the survey, 149 households were sampled representing a sampling intensity of 19% in both communities. One hundred forty-seven species of plants were mentioned, falling into 51 families with the most commonly used families being Asteraceae, Liliaceae sens. lat. and Poaceae. The study also revealed that tenurial rights on these resources are communal and usufructuary and are increasingly being undermined by commercialization that relegate resources to an open access system. The study identified six main use categories, namely, firewood, handcrafts, medicinals, wild fruits, wild vegetables, and miscellaneous uses. Finally, the study demonstrated that ethnobotanical knowledge is widely held in Lesotho with the traditional doctors being the major repositories.","journal":"Economic Botany","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":true}

Particularly regions suffering from a lack of water urgently need integrated environmental protection and resource conservation (EP and RC) technologies in order to enable effective management of the available water resources. EP and RC-concepts focus on pollution prevention and on a maximum of consumptive use of energy, chemicals, and water in pollution prevention and on a minimum of consumptive une of energy, chemicals, and water in pollution abatement and a maximum of re-use of treated wastewater, by-products and residues produced in the treatment of waste and wastewater. Consequently, by implementing these concepts, waste(water)s like sewage and industrial effluents become an important source of water, fertilisers, soil conditioners and (frequently) energy instead of a social threat. In addition, a bridge is made between environmental protection and agriculture practice, stimulating (urban) agriculture in the neighbourhood of large cities. Anaerobic treatment is considered as the core technology for mineralising organic compounds in waste(water) streams. Additional technologies are required to comply with the reuse criteria. Some examples of possible EP and RC concepts, using the anaerobic treatment technology for the reclamation of domestic sewage are discussed.","journal":"Serial","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Due to various historical, political, geographic and climatic conditions the divergence between those countries providing and those receiving help is so vast that donations of labor an/or money is simply not enough. Rather, communities have to be taught to support and develop themselves during the receipt of aid and especially after the help pulls out. It is our goal in this article to summarize one such Â»sustainable developmentÂ« project. As volunteers for AMREF (African Medical and Research Foundation), we worked with the remarkable Makueni Applied Nutrition Project in eastern Kenya in the summer of 2001. Our job was to visit the various locations in this semiarid and arid environment and to write a report on the situation of the diverse parts of the project.

It was evident that over the 10-20 years during which these reefs have deteriorated (mainly due to reef-flat trampling), there have been interrelated shifts in the nature of visitors making use of them. First, there has been a shift from experienced divers and snorkellers to inexperienced snorkellers and non-snorkellers with a poorer knowledge of reef biology. Second, there has been a shift in the predominant nationalities of visitors, from German and British, through Italian, to Russian. More recent user groups both stated and showed that they had less experience of snorkelling; they also showed less knowledge of marine life and less interest in learning about it. Visitor perceptions of both the state of the marine life on the reefs and the acceptability of current visitor numbers also varied between groups. More recent visitor groups and visitors with less knowledge were more satisfied with reef health. In general, however, visitor perceptions of reef health did not correlate well with actual reef conditions, probably because more experienced visitors preferred less impacted sites with which they were nevertheless less satisfied than inexperienced visitors at heavily impacted sites. More recent visitor groups were also less bothered by crowding on the shore or in the water. Consequently, the apparent \"social carrying capacity\" of sites seems to be increasing to a level well above the likely \"ecological carrying capacity\".

Data was compiled and analyzed for over 4000 of these sites. Management of these protected areas varied from weak to effective, with about 40% showing major deficiencies. About 14% of the surveyed areas showed significant deficiencies across many management effectiveness indicators and hence lacked basic requirements to operate effectively. Strongest management factors recorded on average related to establishment of protected areas (legal establishment, design, legislation and boundary marking) and to effectiveness of governance; while the weakest aspects of management included community benefit programs, resourcing (funding reliability and adequacy, staff numbers and facility and equipment maintenance) and management effectiveness evaluation. Estimations of management outcomes, including both environmental values conservation and impact on communities, were positive. We conclude that in spite of inadequate funding and management process, there are indications that protected areas are contributing to biodiversity conservation and community well-being.

This reuse depends on the public's perceptions of risk and their willingness to support the new uses of the sites. This study examines attitudes about the reuse of large coastal brownfields from local and nonlocal students and the public. The sites include the buffer area surrounding a nuclear power plant, an area contaminated by a chemical spill, and a ranch (which was used as a control site). The results show that all the samples are more supportive of the establishment of nature preserves with human access than either nature preserves without access or developed recreation areas. Limits on human access to the sites are more acceptable for the contaminated sites and more acceptable to the nonlocal samples.

We use the empirical observation that subsistence hunters are central-place foragers to develop three \"bio-demographic'' hunting models of increasing complexity and realism for assessing the sustainability of hunting of an indicator species. In all our models, we calculate the spatial pattern of depletion of an indicator species (here, a large-bodied primate) across a landscape. Specifically, we show how to identify the area surrounding a human settlement that is expected to suffer local extinction. Our approach is an improvement over well-known sustainability indices of hunting, which are prone to error and do not provide clear links to policy prescriptions. Our first approach models the long-term effect of a single settlement and (1) can be parameterized with easily obtainable field data (such as settlement maps and knowledge of the major weapon used), (2) is simple enough to be used without requiring technical skill, and (3) reveals the asymptotic relationship between local human density and the level of game depletion. Our second model allows multiple settlements with overlapping hunting zones over large spatial scales. Our third model additionally allows temporal changes in human population size and distribution and source-sink dynamics in game populations. Using transect and hunting data from two Amazonian sites, we show that the models accurately predict the spatial distribution of primate depletion. To make these methods accessible, we provide software-based tools, including a toolbox for ArcGIS, to assist in managing and mapping the spatial extent of hunting. The proposed application of our models is to allow the quantitative assessment of settlement stabilization approaches to managing hunting in Amazonia.","journal":"Ecological Applications","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}

Marine ecosystems are complex adaptive systems composed of individual agents that interact with one another to produce collective effects, integrating scales from individual behaviors to the dynamics of whole systems. In such systems, small changes can be magnified through nonlinear interactions, facilitating regime shifts and collapses. Protection of the services these ecosystems provide must therefore maintain the adaptive capacities of these systems by preserving a balance among heterogeneity, modularity, and redundancy, tightening feedback loops to provide incentives for sound stewardship. The challenge for management is to increase incentives to individuals, and tighten reward loops, in ways that will strengthen the robustness and resilience of these systems and preserve their ability to provide ecosystem services for generations to come.

Elder fishermen provide an important source of information in a context of limited catch data, declining fishing effort, and evolving local fishing traditions. Most fishermen interviewed during the study described a decline in the quality of various nearshore habitats, a general decrease in abundance of edible reef fish, and diminished abundance of locally valued palolo, atule, giant clams, and octopus. Populations of reef sharks and turtles are typically seen as stable or increasing. Fishermen from the relatively densely populated island of Tutuila tended to report a greater decrease in abundance of marine resources in general than did fishermen from the more remote Manu'a Islands. Elder fishermen commonly reported deterioration of nearshore and shoreline habitats as an issue of concern. Many interviewees also asserted that past use of destructive fishing methods has led to a decline in marine resources in the region. The fishermen generated various recommendations for improving local fisheries, including: reducing runoff-related pollution and sediment, preventing destructive fishing methods, and establishing marine protected areas. Although traditional marine tenure systems are no longer as influential in American Samoa as they were in the past, various rules regarding appropriate use of local marine ecosystems and associated resources continue to be implemented across the islands.

Positive deviance is increasingly employed in international development activities to permit the utilization of proven local solutions. Including positive deviance methods in evaluation analysis, particularly in places like Bihar, India, where the rates of child underweight hover at 55%, can help identify project activities and household characteristics that affect key outcomes. These can, in turn, inform decision-making regarding the intensification of particularly promising activities. Objectives. To apply positive deviance analysis to the Dular program in Bihar, a community-based nutrition program that seeks to improve the impact of India's Integrated Child Development Services on young children. Methods. In order to assure that desired program outcomes were not dependent on higher economic status, the analysis isolated a subset ofprogram beneficiaries - the poorest children with the best nutritional outcomes - and examined the behavioral and project factors that may have brought about positive results in this subgroup. The data for this analysis were drawn from a 2005 program evaluation with a sample of 1,560 children. Results. The analysis found that positive deviant children with normal nutritional status in the poorest 50% of Dular households were introduced to complementary food almost 2 months earlier (7.18 vs. 9.02 months of age) than severely malnourished children, were more than twice as likely to use soap for handwashing after defecation (25.0% vs. 11.8%), and were more than seven times as likely to have literate mothers (25.0% vs. 3.5%). Conclusions. The analysis suggests that programmatic efforts relating to these activities have been particularly effective and may well deserve increased investment.

The programme's objective is to bring about a reduction of the nutrient load to the sea by increasing the wetland area in the drainage basin. The types of wetlands to be created are mainly ponds and buffer zones along watercourses. The programme hinges on the voluntary participation of landowners. Their participation is encouraged by economic compensation for land which is converted to ponds or buffer zones. In March 1997, 121 actors within the Kavlinge River Programme (eg landowners, politicians, officials and nature conservation societies) were invited to two introductory meetings. Three short keynote lectures opened the introductory meetings: Landowning and Land Use - a Historical Perspective; The Industrialization of Farming; Ecological Economics. In order to give all invited actors an opportunity to express an opinion, a mail questionnaire was distributed to them together with the invitation. The questionnaire included, inter alia, open-ended questions about motives for different actors to participate in the Kavlinge River Programme and perceived advantages and disadvantages of wetland creation. The answers to such questions provide a part of the preliminary basis for the design of willingness-to-pay studies concerning wetland creation and the institutional setting for wetland creation. The questionnaire also investigated respondents' perception of the relative importance of different services supplied by nature. This report includes a description of the Kavlinge River Programme, a summary of the discussion at the introductory meetings, the results of the questionnaire and a discussion of the findings.","journal":"Markanvandning och naturresursforhallanden i Kavlingeans Avrinningsomrade: genomforande och nytta av lokala vatmarksprojekt - en forstudie","included":false,"abstractReview":true,"unresolved":false}
