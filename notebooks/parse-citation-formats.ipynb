      "Bad line: Methods Using medical charts, clinical data (including white blood cell [WBC] count, platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen [BUN] creatinine, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], aspartate amino transferase [AST], alanine amino transferase [ALT], and urinary phenol) were gathered for the subjects who were exposed to the Gulf oil spill and analyzed. Results A total of 117 subjects exposed to the oil spill were included. Over 77% of subjects had WBC counts in the mid range (6-10 × 103 per μL), while none of the subjects had the upper limit of the normal range (11 × 103 per μL). A similar pattern was seen in the platelet counts and BUN levels among the oil spill-exposed subjects. Conversely, over 70% of the subjects had creatinine levels toward the upper limit of the normal range and 23% of subjects had creatinine levels above the upper limit of the normal range (&gt;1.3 mg per dL). Similarly, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were toward the upper limit of normal in more than two thirds of the subjects. AST and ALT levels above the upper limit of normal range (&gt;40 IU per L) were seen in 15% and 31% of subjects, respectively. Over 80% of subjects had urinary phenol levels higher than detectable levels (2 mg per L).\n",

       "{'abstract': 'Poly (styrene-divinylbenzene) (P (St-DVB)) foams with porosity as high as 98% were prepared by the method of high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) in one-step process. The materials exhibited superhydrophobicity and excellent oleophilicity, with the water contact angle (WCA) even exceeding 150° and oil contact angle approaching 0°. The materials fabricated with different types of Fe3O4 particles had varied hierarchical pore structures. And the adsorption capacity of the monolithic foam towards chloroform was as high as 57 g/g. Importantly, the materials soaked with oil could be regenerated effectively by means of centrifugation with oil recovery rate reaching 90%. More importantly, the monolithic PolyHIPEs (polymers obtained by the polymerization of the HIPEs) were subjected to 20 adsorption-centrifugation cycles and superior reusability was demonstrated. These features achieved with PolyHIPEs made them ideal candidates for practical oil removal applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
